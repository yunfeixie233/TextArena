Brick (20) is the highest-value resource we hold in surplus, while Sheep are our second most plentiful. Ore (39) is a premium resource I\u2019d like to secure more of.\n\nLooking at the Sheep-for-Brick market signal from Player 1, they want a 2-for-1 or 3-for-2 rate, which is unfavorable, so we won\u2019t take that.\n\nTo tilt the value scale further in my favor I\u2019ll propose a small package deal: give up 2 sheep and 1 brick (value 12+20=32) to receive 1 ore and 2 wood (value 39+22=61), netting +29. Player 1 has shown interest in brick and sheep.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick \u2192 1 Ore, 2 Wood]",
