      "response": "After assessing my current inventory and the fixed resource values, I need to propose a mutually beneficial trade that helps boost my total asset value. I have an abundance of Sheep (18 units) and Wheat (5 units), which are on the lower end of the value spectrum. Meanwhile, Brick and Ore are more valuable per unit. To increase my asset value, I should trade some of my lower-value resources for higher-value ones in a deal that appears balanced or beneficial to another player, encouraging acceptance.\n\nTrade strategy:\n- Target: Acquire more Brick (value 30 per unit) to utilize its high value.\n- Offer: Combine Sheep and Wheat, as I have plenty, to make the trade appealing.\n- Balance: Ensure the trade appears balanced by the fixed values to be mutually beneficial. Specifically:\n  - Give: 4 Sheep (4 * 14 = 56 value) and 2 Wheat (2 * 6 = 12 value), totaling 68 value.\n  - Get: 2 Brick (2 * 30 = 60 value).\n- Rationale: While I'm giving slightly more value (68) than I'm receiving (60), the trade consolidates my low-value surpluses into a higher-value asset. This initial trade builds goodwill and may open opportunities for more profitable deals in later rounds. The loss in immediate value (8) is acceptable given my surplus Sheep, and acquiring Brick positions me for future high-value trades.\n\nGiven the need to engage actively from the start, I propose:\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",
