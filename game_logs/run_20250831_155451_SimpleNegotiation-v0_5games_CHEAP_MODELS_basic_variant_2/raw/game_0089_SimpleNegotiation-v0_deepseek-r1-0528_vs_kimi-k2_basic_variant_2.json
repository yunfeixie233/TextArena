The trade must be structured to be mutually beneficial, so I use a ratio that minimizes loss for the trading partner:\n\n- Wheat value per unit: 6\n- Ore value per unit: 37  \nTo keep values nearly equal: 6 Wheat (6 \u00d7 6 = 36 value) for 1 Ore (37 value). This gives me a net gain of 1 value unit while the partner's potential loss is minimal (1 value unit), increasing the likelihood of acceptance due to the small discrepancy.\n\nGiven my large quantity of Wheat (23 units), losing 6 units is manageable. Acquiring more Ore could be advantageous for future high-value trades.\n\n**Proposed trade:**  \n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

I have zero Wheat left, so these offers are automatically moot to me (require more Wheat than I hold).  \n- The only \u201carbitrage\u201d resource I am truly short on now is Wheat (worth 6 per unit). Meanwhile Ore (32) is my single most expensive commodity and I am slightly over-exposed to it.\n\nStrategic Move  \nI have surplus Brick (22 units) averaging 25 per unit. Brick is plentiful and stable but lower tier than Ore. I can safely spare 4\u20135 Brick while keeping >17 in reserve for flexibility.\n\nI also saw earlier that Player 0 repeatedly offered 1 Ore for 6 Wheat (\u2248 6-to-32 rate). Flip it: if Player 0 is eager for Wheat, they likely value it. Brick can sit lower in their preference hierarchy. Offering bulk Brick at that implied exchange ratio (but in my favour) projects strong value:\n\n- 4 Brick \u00d7 25 = 100 value  \n- Return of 1 Ore + 2 Wheat = 32 + 2\u00d76 = 44 value  \n- Equivalent to ~2.27 value units of my Brick for each value unit received. That is a major **value gain**.\n\nPlayer 0 may thus perceive the ratio as worthwhile because it solves their Wheat shortfall while dumping only one Ore and marginal Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 4 Brick, 1 Ore -> 1 Ore, 2 Wheat]",
