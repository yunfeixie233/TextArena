Acquiring more could be profitable.\n2. **Identify overvalued resources**: Wheat (5) is the lowest value and I have a lot (8). Sheep (12) is also relatively low value with high quantity (10).\n3. **Trade strategy**: Offer high-quantity, low-value resources to acquire high-value resources (Brick, Ore).\n\n### Possible Trades:\n- Wheat and Sheep are the most expendable.\n- Brick and Ore are targets for acquisition.\n\n### First Trade Proposal:\nI want to trade some Wheat and Sheep for Brick and Ore. I have plenty of Wheat and Sheep, and acquiring more Brick/Ore will directly increase total value.\n\n**Trade Proposal**:\n- Offer 3 Sheep (36 value) + 4 Wheat (20 value) = 56 value given.\n- Request 2 Brick (44 value) + 1 Ore (34 value) = 78 value received.\n- Net gain: 78 - 56 = +22 value.\n\nHowever, this might be too skewed. Let\u2019s try a more balanced approach.\n\n**Revised Trade Proposal**:\n- Offer 2 Sheep (24 value) + 6 Wheat (30 value) = 54 value given.\n- Request 3 Brick (66 value) + 1 Wood (9 value) = 75 value received.\n- Net gain: 75 - 54 = +21 value.\n\nThis seems more reasonable, though still skewed in my favor. Let me adjust.\n\n**Final First Trade Proposal**:\n- Offer 2 Sheep (24 value) + 6 Wheat (30 value) = 54 value given.\n- Request 3 Brick (66 value) + 1 Wood (9 value) = 75 value received.\n- Net gain: +21 value.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 6 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood]",
