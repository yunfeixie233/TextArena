I will aim for trades where the value of resources acquired is significantly higher than the value of resources traded. I'll also try to simplify my inventory by consolidating into higher-value resources.\n\nLet's begin. My first move will be an offer.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 6 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]",
