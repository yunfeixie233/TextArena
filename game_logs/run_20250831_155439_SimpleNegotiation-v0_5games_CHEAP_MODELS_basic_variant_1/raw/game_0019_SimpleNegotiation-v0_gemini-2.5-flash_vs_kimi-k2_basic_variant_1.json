      "response": "Here's my thought process for responding to the game prompt as Player 0:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** Maximize wealth. Wealth is calculated by `(Quantity * Value)` for each resource.\n\n2.  **Analyze Current Resources:**\n    *   Wheat: 6 * 5 = 30\n    *   Wood: 18 * 10 = 180\n    *   Sheep: 25 * 14 = 350\n    *   Brick: 18 * 28 = 504\n    *   Ore: 15 * 36 = 540\n    *   **Total Initial Wealth:** 30 + 180 + 350 + 504 + 540 = 1604\n\n3.  **Analyze the Last Turn's Action:**\n    *   Player 0 offered: 4 Wood (Value: 4 * 10 = 40)\n    *   Player 0 requested: 1 Ore (Value: 1 * 36 = 36)\n    *   Player 1 Accepted.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Last Trade (from Player 0's perspective):**\n    *   Gave up 40 wealth (4 Wood).\n    *   Gained 36 wealth (1 Ore).\n    *   **Net change:** -4 wealth.\n\n5.  **Critical Self-Correction:** This was a *bad* trade for Player 0! I gave away more value than I received. My goal is to *maximize* wealth, not give it away. I need to be more strategic.\n\n6.  **Update Resource Portfolio after the trade:**\n    *   Wheat: 6 (unchanged)\n    *   Wood: 18 - 4 = 14\n    *   Sheep: 25 (unchanged)\n    *   Brick: 18 (unchanged)\n    *   Ore: 15 + 1 = 16\n    *   **Current Wealth:** (6*5) + (14*10) + (25*14) + (18*28) + (16*36) = 30 + 140 + 350 + 504 + 576 = 1600. (Confirms the -4 wealth change).\n\n7.  **Consider Player 1's Action:** \"Player 1 made no new trade offer.\" This means it's my turn to initiate.\n\n8.  **Formulate a *Good* Trade Strategy:**\n    *   **Goal:** Gain more value than I give.\n    *   **Look for high-value resources to acquire:** Ore (36), Brick (28), Sheep (14) are good. Wheat (5) is low. Wood (10) is mid.\n    *   **Look for resources I have a good quantity of to offer:** I have a lot of Wood (14), Sheep (25), Brick (18), Ore (16). I have less Wheat (6).\n    *   **Targeting Profit:** I need the `Value(Requested Items)` to be greater than `Value(Offered Items)`.\n\n9.  **Brainstorm Potential Trades (and calculate values):**\n\n    *   **Option 1: Get more Ore (highest value)**\n        *   Offer: 3 Wood (3*10=30) -> Request: 1 Ore (1*36=36). Profit: +6. (Good!)\n        *   Offer: 2 Brick (2*28=56) -> Request: 2 Ore (2*36=72). Profit: +16. (Even better!)\n        *   Offer: 5 Wood (5*10=50) -> Request: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep (28+14=42). Loss: -8. (Bad!)\n\n    *   **Option 2: Get more Brick (second highest value)**\n        *   Offer: 4 Wood (4*10=40) -> Request: 2 Sheep (2*14=28). Loss: -12. (Bad!)\n        *   Offer: 2 Sheep (2*14=28) -> Request: 1 Brick (1*28=28). Even trade, no profit. Why bother?\n        *   Offer: 3 Sheep (3*14=42) -> Request: 1 Brick, 1 Wood (28+10=38). Loss: -4. (Bad!)\n\n    *   **Option 3: Get rid of low-value resources for high ones (if possible)**\n        *   Offer: 5 Wheat (5*5=25) -> Request: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep (10+14=24). Loss: -1. (Small loss, but gets rid of Wheat). Maybe if I stack it?\n        *   Offer: 6 Wheat (6*5=30) -> Request: 1 Brick (1*28=28). Loss: -2. (Still a loss).\n        *   This is hard because I don't have enough low-value items to equal high-value ones.\n\n10. **Select the Best Offer:** The offer `[Offer: 2 Brick -> 2 Ore]` looks very good.\n    *   Offered Value: 2 * 28 = 56\n    *   Requested Value: 2 * 36 = 72\n    *   **Net Gain:** 72 - 56 = +16 wealth. This is a significant positive trade.\n    *   I have 18 Brick, so offering 2 is fine. I have 16 Ore, but acquiring more is always good since it's the highest value.\n\n11. **Final Check:**\n    *   Am I following the format? Yes, `[Offer: What_You_Give -> What_You_Want]`.\n    *   Is it a strategic move to maximize wealth? Yes, it's a profitable trade.\n    *   Is it reasonable for an opponent to accept? Maybe. They are giving me their highest value resource. However, if they don't have a high demand for Brick or a surplus of Ore, they *might* take it. It's an aggressive but logical offer.\n\nThis thought process leads directly to the suggested output: `[Offer: 2 Brick -> 2 Ore]`",
