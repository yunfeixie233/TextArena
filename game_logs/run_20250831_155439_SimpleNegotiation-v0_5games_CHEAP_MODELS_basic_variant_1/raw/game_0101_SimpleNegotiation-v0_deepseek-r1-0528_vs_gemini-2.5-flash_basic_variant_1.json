This is a bad trade for me. I would be losing 21 in value.\n\nI will reject this offer.\n\nNext, I need to make an offer.\nMy wealth is currently:\n24 * 6 = 144 (Wheat)\n9 * 10 = 90 (Wood)\n15 * 13 = 195 (Sheep)\n16 * 29 = 464 (Brick)\n11 * 33 = 363 (Ore)\nTotal = 1256\n\nI have some surplus of Wheat and Sheep. I also have a lot of Brick.\nOre is the most valuable resource.\n\nLet's try to trade some less valuable resources for more valuable ones, specifically Ore or Brick. Or trade for resources I have a lower quantity of, if the value is good.\n\nI have 24 Wheat, which is a lot. Maybe I can trade some Wheat and Wood for Ore.\nOr Sheep for Ore/Brick.\n\nLet's consider offering Wheat and Sheep for Ore.\nIf I offer 3 Wheat and 1 Sheep: Value = (3 * 6) + (1 * 13) = 18 + 13 = 31\nIf I request 1 Ore: Value = 33. This is a small loss for P0, might be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, I have a good amount of Brick. I could try to trade Brick for Ore at a better ratio than P0 offered.\nP0 offered 3 Brick (87) for 2 Ore (66). This implies 1 Brick is roughly 22 value in their mind for Ore.\n\nI have 16 Brick. Maybe I can offer 1 Brick for 1 Ore.\nValue of 1 Brick = 29\nValue of 1 Ore = 33\nThis is a good trade for me, 4 value gain. It's a 4 value loss for P0. P0 might not accept this.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nI have a lot of Sheep and Wheat.\nHow about trading a lot of Wheat for some Ore?\nIf I offer 5 Wheat (5 * 6 = 30) for 1 Ore (33), it's close in value. Small loss for P0.\n\nLet's try to get Brick from Player 0 if they have a lot. I have 16, they might have more. Or I can offer something they might value.\n\nI want to increase my wealth, which means I want to get more value than I give.\n\nLet's try a trade that gives Player 0 resources they might need while getting high-value resources.\nMaybe I can get some Ore or Brick, which are high value.\nI have a decent amount of Brick, but more Ore would be good.\n\nLet's try to offer a mix of lower-value resources for a higher-value one.\nI have plenty of Wheat and Sheep.\n\nOffer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore\nValue I give: (4 * 6) + (1 * 10) = 24 + 10 = 34\nValue I want: 1 * 33 = 33\nThis is a 1 value loss for me, which seems counter-intuitive. I should aim for a gain.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, as it's the highest value.\nHow about trading some Wheat and Sheep for it?\nI have 15 Sheep.\nOffer: 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore\nValue I give: (2 * 13) + (2 * 6) = 26 + 12 = 38\nValue I want: 1 * 33 = 33\nThis is 5 value loss for me. Not good.\n\nLet's rethink. I want to gain value.\nI have a lot of Wheat. I can give away a lot of Wheat.\n\nWhat if I ask for Wood, which is less valuable but I have fewer of?\nI have 9 Wood.\nNo, I should be aiming for more valuable resources or a very favorable trade of low value for higher value.\n\nConsider trading away Brick (29) or Ore (33) for a very large quantity of less valuable resources if it leads to a net value gain. This is rarely the case unless the opponent is desperate.\n\nLet's try an offer that makes sense for me.\nI have 16 Brick (value 29). I have 11 Ore (value 33).\nI have 24 Wheat (value 6).\n\nIf I offer something where the total value I give is less than the total value I receive.\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 2 Ore\nValue I give: (2 * 13) + (1 * 29) = 26 + 29 = 55\nValue I want: (2 * 33) = 66\nThis is a gain of 11 for me. This might be too much for P0.\n\nLet's try to be slightly less greedy for the first offer.\nPlayer 0 offered 3 Brick (87) for 2 Ore (66), which was a 21 loss for them if I accepted. They wanted 66 value and offered 87 value.\n\nI have strong holdings in Wheat, Sheep, and Brick.\nI want more Ore because it's valuable.\nI want to clear out some of my Wheat if possible.\n\nMaybe I can offer a combination of Brick and Wheat for Ore.\nOffer: 1 Brick, 4 Wheat -> 2 Ore\nValue I give: (1 * 29) + (4 * 6) = 29 + 24 = 53\nValue I want: (2 * 33) = 66\nThis gives me a gain of 13. This is quite good for me, but maybe too much for P0.\n\nLet's try a simpler one.\nMaybe 1 Brick for 1.5 Ore equivalent.\nOr some excess Wheat for something more valuable.\n\nLet's try to trade some Sheep and Wheat for Brick or Ore.\nOffer: 3 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 2 Brick\nValue I give: (3 * 13) + (5 * 6) = 39 + 30 = 69\nValue I want: (2 * 29) = 58\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nThe previous offer by Player 0 (3 Brick -> 2 Ore) gave Player 0 a gain of (87 - 66) = 21 at my expense.\nSo they are looking for a significant gain.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore to get a lot of lower value resources? No, I want to max wealth.\n\nLet's try an offer where I get 1 Ore for resources slightly above its value, but still a gain for me, and seems fair to P0.\n1 Ore is 33.\nWhat if I offer a mix of Wheat and Sheep for 1 Ore?\nOffer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore\nValue I give: 3 * 13 = 39\nValue I want: 1 * 33 = 33\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nI need to focus on gaining value.\nI have 16 Brick (value 29). I have 11 Ore (value 33).\nMy total wealth is 1256.\n\nHow about trading one of my Brick for an Ore, potentially with a small amount of Wheat to sweeten the deal for P0.\nOffer: 1 Brick, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore\nValue I give: (1 * 29) + (2 * 6) = 29 + 12 = 41\nValue I want: 1 * 33 = 33\nLoss for me.\n\nLet's try to trade for something I have less of, like Wood, if the deal is sweet.\nI have 9 Wood. Not a lot.\n\nWhat if I try to get Brick for Wheat and Sheep?\nOffer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Brick\nValue I give: (4 * 13) + (2 * 6) = 52 + 12 = 64\nValue I want: (2 * 29) = 58\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nI need to make an offer where I get more value than I give.\nI want Ore.\nLet's try to get 1 Ore.\nWhat's the absolute lowest value I can give for 1 Ore (33)?\nPossible items for under 33:\n5 Wheat (30)\n2 Wood (20)\n2 Sheep (26)\n1 Brick (29)\n\nIf I offer 5 Wheat for 1 Ore:\nValue I give: 5 * 6 = 30\nValue I want: 1 * 33 = 33\nGain of 3 for me. This is reasonable. Player 0 loses 3 value. This is a very good first offer. It's a small loss for P0, but they might need Wheat.\n\nLet's evaluate Player 0's behavior from the previous round.\nPlayer 0 offered 3 Brick -> 2 Ore. They offered 87 value and requested 66 value. This means they were trying to gain 21 value. They are aggressive.\n\nSo, a small gain like my 5 Wheat for 1 Ore might not be accepted by P0 if they are looking for large gains.\n\nI need to be proactive and make an offer that could be accepted, while still improving my wealth.\n\nWhat if I offer to give them high volume of low value for some high value stuff?\nI have plenty of Wheat and Sheep.\nLet me offer a slightly more aggressive trade that benefits me significantly.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]\nValue of what I give: (8 * 6) + (2 * 10) = 48 + 20 = 68\nValue of what I want: (2 * 33) + (1 * 29) = 66 + 29 = 95\nMy potential gain: 95 - 68 = 27\nThis is a significant gain for me. P0 loses 27 value. This is similar to the magnitude of gain P0 tried to make on me (21 value). It might be too aggressive for them to accept.\n\nI should make an offer that is more balanced, but still benefits me.\nWhat about targeting Wood? I have less Wood.\nOr Sheep.\nMy resources:\nWheat: 24 (6)\nWood: 9 (10)\nSheep: 15 (13)\nBrick: 16 (29)\nOre: 11 (33)\n\nWhat if I aim for 1 Ore (value 33)?\nI give: 1 Brick (29) and 1 Wood (10) = 39. This is a loss.\nI give: 2 Sheep (26) and 1 Wheat (6) = 32. This is a very small loss of 1 for me. P0 gains 1. Not good.\n\nI need to ensure my \"What_You_Give\" value is less than \"What_You_Want\" value.\nTry to give plentiful cheap resources for valuable ones.\n\nOffer: 6 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick\nValue given: (6 * 6) + (1 * 10) = 36 + 10 = 46\nValue wanted: 1 * 29 = 29\nThis is a loss for me. Not good.\n\nWhat about trading Wood for Brick/Ore since I have less Wood?\nNo, I should be trading *away* things I have a lot of for things that are valuable.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nOffer: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore\nValue I give: (1 * 29) + (1 * 13) = 42\nValue I want: 1 * 33 = 33\nThis is a loss for me. I am struggling with good value trades that would be acceptable.\n\nMy goal is to maximize wealth.\nI have a significant amount of Brick. Maybe I can trade some Brick for Ore.\nMy current Brick to Ore ratio (my internal value) is 29:33.\nPlayer 0's offer was 3 Brick (87) for 2 Ore (66), so their implied value of Brick relative to Ore (from their perspective) is giving 87 for getting 66. So they value Brick more than Ore.\n\nIf I offer 2 Brick for 1 Ore:\nValue I give: 2 * 29 = 58\nValue I want: 1 * 33 = 33\nThis is a loss for me (25 value). I wouldn't do this.\n\nIf I offer 1 Ore for 2 Brick:\nValue I give: 1 * 33 = 33\nValue I want: 2 * 29 = 58\nThis is a gain of 25 for me! This is excellent. Player 0 loses 25. Given their previous aggression, they might consider this if they truly have too much Brick or value Ore highly. I have 11 Ore, so I can afford to part with one for a good profit.\n\nLet's make this offer. It's aggressive, but so was P0.\nIt's possible they are resource-rich in Brick and would consider exchanging some for Ore, which is high value.\n\nFinal plan:\n1. Deny Player 0's offer (3 Brick -> 2 Ore). It leads to a personal loss of 21.\n2. Make a new offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick. This gives me a gain of 25 value.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]",
