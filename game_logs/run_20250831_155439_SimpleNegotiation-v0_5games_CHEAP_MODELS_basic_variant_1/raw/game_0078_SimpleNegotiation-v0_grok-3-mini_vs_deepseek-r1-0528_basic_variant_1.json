Adding more low-value resources (Wood/Wheat) risks imbalance without significant gain.  \n  - Ore (value 37) is our highest-value resource. Protecting it for future asymmetric trades (e.g., exchanging low-value surpluses for high-value assets) is preferable to a marginal gain.  \n  - Player 0 previously sought Brick/Sheep/Ore, indicating they prioritize high-value resources. Accepting this would encourage further demands for Ore.  \n\n### Counter-Offer Strategy:\nWe will **deny** the offer and propose a trade leveraging our **Wood surplus** (22) to acquire **Brick** (value 26), which balances our portfolio and capitalizes on excess low-value stock:  \n- **Give**: 12 Wood (our cost: 12\u00d710 = 120, but abundant)  \n- **Request**: 4 Brick (opponent\u2019s cost: 4\u00d726 = 104, attractive to them if they undervalue Brick).  \n- **Rationale**:  \n  - We sacrifice low-impact resources to gain higher-value assets.  \n  - For Player 0, receiving 12 Wood (value 120) for 4 Brick (104) *appears* favorable (net +16).

To maximize wealth, I must prioritize trades with a clear value advantage. Currently, Brick is highly valuable to me (26 each), while Wood is less valuable (10 each). Player 0 has demonstrated a willingness to trade Wood in bulk for Brick, as evidenced by their acceptance of the last offer. I will capitalize on this by offering a new trade that exploits the value gap.\n\n**Strategy for this turn:**\n- Focus on **profit-driven exchange**: Give high-value Brick only if I receive significantly overvalued returns in Wood, gaining net value.\n- Avoid repeating unprofitable trades: My Wood stock is now lower (10 after last trade), so I will not propose trades that worsen my position.\n- Exploit observed patterns: Player 0 values Brick highly and may overpay with Wood.\n\nI propose:  \n**[Offer: 1 Brick -> 4 Wood]**  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **Value calculation**:  \n  - I give 1 Brick (value 26).  \n  - I receive 4 Wood (value 40).  \n  - **Net gain**: +14 value (40 received - 26 given).  \n- **Portfolio impact**:  \n  - After trade: Brick reduces to 19, Wood increases to 14.  \n  - Total value increases from 1,536 to 1,550.  \n- **Why Player 0 might accept**:  \n  They previously accepted 12 Wood for 4 Brick (a 3:1 Wood-to-Brick ratio), suggesting they value Brick highly relative to Wood. This offer (4:1 Wood-to-Brick) aligns with their behavior but heavily favors me.  \n\nThis trade maximizes immediate value gain and leverages Player 0\u2019s trading tendencies.
