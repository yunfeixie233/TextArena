A high-value item is very attractive to me.  \n\u2022 I have no Wheat reserve risk \u2013 even if I dumped **all** my Wheat in a deal I\u2019d still be fine.

Proposed deal that exploits both observations  \nI will sell you some of my abundant Brick and Ore for Wheat.  \nYou (Player 1) give: 6 Wheat  \nI give: 5 Brick + 4 Ore  \n\nFrom my perspective:  \n- I convert low-marginal-utility surplus (Brick & Ore) into scarce, high-value Wheat.  \n- If you value Wheat at or near list price, this is a slight value loss for me in *nominal* terms, but the increased liquidity of Wheat and my remaining surpluses compensates.\n\nYet from *your* perspective, the Wheat total you are asked to surrender (value 30) is well below the combined nominal value of the 5 Brick + 4 Ore I\u2019m giving you (140+144=284), so you should like this ratio even if your subjective values differ.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick, 4 Ore -> 6 Wheat]",

So far every fish they\u2019ve taken involved giving up Sheep or Wheat. They have now:\n- 0 Sheep (worth 13)  \n- Low Wheat (maybe none)  \n\nMy goal is to extract maximum surplus while keeping value \u2265 parity. Re-distributing 2\u20133 of my cheaper Wheat (value 5) for their higher-valued goods will push W up fastest.\n\nOffer (1):  \n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 2 Wood]  \nIntra-value: 2\u00d75 = 10 \u2192 2\u00d712 = 24 > +14 marginal\n\nOffer (2):  \n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 2 Ore]  \nIntra-value: 3\u00d75 = 15 \u2192 2\u00d736 = 72 > +57 marginal\n\nBecause Wood (12) is the lighter pressure resource, Player 1 is likeliest to bite (she appears more willing to sacrifice Wood than Ore). I\u2019ll try the first offer:\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 2 Wood, 0 Sheep]",
