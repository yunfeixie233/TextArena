You offered   4 Sheep, 1 Ore  \u2192  4 Brick, 2 Wood         (rejected)\n4. They offered nothing.\n5. You offered   3 Ore, 2 Wheat  \u2192  3 Brick, 2 Wood         (rejected)\n6. They offered nothing.\n\nWe are now at the beginning of turn 7 (4 more opportunities remain after this one).\n\nKey observations so far\n- Player 0 has declined every offer\u2014even the last one where you were giving extra Ore/Wheat value.\n- Player 0 is making no counter-offers; they have declined even to show any resource interest at all.\n- Given the identical \u201cno new trade offer\u201d message each round, Player 0 might be scripted to only accept strict surplus-for-them trades while never initiating. In short: we need to tempt them with clear value gain to stand any chance of a deal.\n\nFast check of value ratios (using your listed 5-12-17-23-36 scale):\n\n- Ore 36 is king.  \n- Brick 23 is second-best.  \n- Sheep 17 and Wood 12 are lower, Wheat 5 is weakest.\n\nYou have\nOre 15 | Brick 21 | Wood 15 | Sheep 6 | Wheat 8\n\nOffering Ore or Brick away must deliver something even more valuable in return (which is tricky, since nothing is) \u2014 so the rational way to entice Player 0 is to offer surplus Wood or Sheep for the scarcer Brick/Ore, at a rate below listed \u201cvalue\u201d for you but still above zero for them. A simple 3-for-2 or 4-for-2 style ratio can work if Player 0 is indeed value-sensitive.\n\nAdjusted proposal for round 7\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",
