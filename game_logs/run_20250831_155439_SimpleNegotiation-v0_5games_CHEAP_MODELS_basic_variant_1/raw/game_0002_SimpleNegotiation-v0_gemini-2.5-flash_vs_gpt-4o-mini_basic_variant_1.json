      "response": "All trades are final. Once a resource is traded, it cannot be returned. I understand I am Player 0. My goal is to maximize my wealth, which is the sum of (quantity * value) for all my resources. I will carefully consider the value of resources being offered and requested in trades. I will prioritize trades that increase my total wealth.\n\nMy current portfolio value:\n* Wheat: 12 * 5 = 60\n* Wood: 5 * 10 = 50\n* Sheep: 5 * 13 = 65\n* Brick: 20 * 23 = 460\n* Ore: 23 * 37 = 851\nTotal Current Wealth: 60 + 50 + 65 + 460 + 851 = 1486\n\nI will always follow the required action command format. I will try to make offers that are favorable to me but also appealing enough for my opponent to consider. I will also be prepared to accept or deny offers based on whether they increase my wealth.\n\nMy first move is to make an offer. I want to try and get rid of some lower-value resources for higher-value ones, specifically more Ore or Brick, or even Sheep if the deal is good. I have a lot of Brick and Ore, but they are also high value. I have a fair amount of Wheat.\n\nLet's try to convert some Wheat and Wood into something more valuable.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
