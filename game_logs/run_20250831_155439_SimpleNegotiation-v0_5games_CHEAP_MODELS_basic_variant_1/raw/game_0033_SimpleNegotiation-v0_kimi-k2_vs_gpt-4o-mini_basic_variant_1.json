      "response": "I need to carefully analyze the current state and propose a strategic trade. Looking at the transaction history, I can see Player 1 has particular preferences - they rejected my high-value ore offers but accepted a trade involving sheep. \n\nRight now:\n- My current resources: 15 Wheat, 10 Wood, 6 Sheep, 3 Brick, 23 Ore\n- I have the most Ore (my highest value resource at 38)\n- I'm low on Sheep and Brick\n\nBased on the patterns, Player 1 seems to value Sheep and wants to acquire it, while I want to acquire more high-value Ore. Let me propose a trade that gives them something they seem to want (Sheep) while getting me more Ore.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Brick, 3 Wood -> 4 Ore, 1 Wheat]",
