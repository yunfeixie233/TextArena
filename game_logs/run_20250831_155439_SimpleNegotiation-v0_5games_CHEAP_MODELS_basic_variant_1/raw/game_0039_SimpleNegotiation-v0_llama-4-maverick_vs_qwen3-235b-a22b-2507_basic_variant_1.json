      "response": "### Initial Assessment and First Move\n\nTo maximize my wealth, I need to strategically trade my resources. Let's start by assessing the current portfolio and understanding the values of the resources.\n\n#### Current Portfolio:\n- Wheat: Qty = 8, Value = 6\n- Wood: Qty = 5, Value = 12\n- Sheep: Qty = 8, Value = 18\n- Brick: Qty = 7, Value = 27\n- Ore: Qty = 21, Value = 32\n\n#### Strategy for the First Round:\n1. **Identify Overvalued and Undervalued Resources**: \n   - Ore is the most valuable resource, and I have a significant quantity (21).\n   - Wheat is the least valuable, and I have 8 units.\n\n2. **Formulate a Trade**:\n   - I can offer some of my less valuable resources or resources I have in abundance in exchange for resources that are more valuable or equally valuable but potentially needed by my opponent.\n\n3. **First Offer**:\n   - I have a lot of Ore (Value = 32) and some Brick (Value = 27), which are high-value resources. I can try to exchange some Ore for other resources that are relatively valuable or needed by me.\n\nGiven the values and quantities, a reasonable first trade could involve offering some Ore in exchange for other valuable resources or maintaining my current high-value resource base.\n\n### Proposed Trade for Round 1:\nSince Ore is very valuable and I have a lot, I'll offer some Ore in exchange for Brick, as Brick is also quite valuable and I have a moderate quantity.\n\n`[Offer: 3 Ore -> 2 Brick]`\n\nThis trade aims to slightly adjust my portfolio by potentially gaining more Brick (if accepted) or initiating a negotiation that could benefit me in subsequent rounds.\n\nLet's see the opponent's response. \n\n**Action for Round 1:** `[Offer: 3 Ore -> 2 Brick]`",

This could mean Player 1 values Brick more than Ore or has sufficient Ore and is looking for other resources.\n   - The current portfolio shows a significant amount of Ore (21 units) and a decent amount of Brick (7 units).\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Given that the last offer was rejected and considering the values of Ore and Brick, it might be beneficial to adjust the offer to make it more appealing to Player 1.\n   - Since Ore is more valuable than Brick, and the previous offer was rejected, we need to either offer less Ore for the same Brick or request fewer Bricks for the same Ore.\n\n5. **New Offer:**\n   - Let's consider offering fewer Ore for 2 Brick. Instead of 3 Ore, offering 2 Ore for 2 Brick could be more appealing.\n   \n6. **Action:**\n   - The new offer would be: `[Offer: 2 Ore -> 2 Brick]`\n\nLet's execute this action.\n\n`[Offer: 2 Ore, 0 Brick -> 2 Brick, 0 Ore]` is not correctly formatted according to the instructions.

This suggests that either Player 1 does not need Brick, has enough Brick, or values Ore less than Brick at the proposed ratio.\n3. **Current Opportunity**: Since Player 1 did not make a counteroffer, we need to decide whether to continue negotiating for Brick or explore other trade opportunities.\n\n#### Decision Making\nGiven the previous rejections and the lack of a counteroffer from Player 1, we will adjust our strategy to explore alternative trades that could be beneficial.\n\n1. **Alternative Trades**: Let's consider offering something we have in abundance for something that is either valuable or scarce for us. We have a significant amount of Ore, so trading some of it for other resources could be a good strategy if we can negotiate a favorable ratio.\n\n2. **Proposal for New Trade**: \n   - We can offer 2 Wood (Value: 24) for 1 Ore (Value: 32). This is not favorable for us as we are losing value.\n   - A more reasonable trade could be offering some of our less valued resources or excess resources for something more valuable.\n\nLet's make a new offer that is potentially more appealing:\n- **[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]**: This involves giving away resources worth (2*18 + 6) = 42 for a Brick worth 27. Not ideal, but let's adjust our numbers.\n\nLet's reconsider the offer:\n- **[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]**: This is more balanced, giving away (18 + 6) = 24 for a Brick worth 27. It's a slight gain in value.\n\nLet's go with: **[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]**.\n\n### Action\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

The value given away is (2 * 18) + (1 * 6) = 36 + 6 = 42, and the value received is 1 * 27 = 27.

A potential trade could be offering Ore for Wood.\n2. **Maintaining Brick quantity**: We've just gained a Brick. It might be beneficial to maintain or slightly increase our Brick quantity if possible, without giving away too much value.\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nConsidering the current state and the fact that we are not in a desperate need to get rid of resources immediately, let's propose a trade that could potentially benefit us.\n\nLet's offer 2 Ore for 1 Wood. This is a reasonable trade given the values of Ore (32) and Wood (12).\n\n### Action Command\n\n`[Offer: 2 Ore -> 1 Wood]`\n\nThis action continues our strategy of trying to negotiate for resources that might be beneficial or enhance our portfolio.",

      "response": "### Game Analysis and Next Move\n\n#### Current Resource Portfolio:\n- Wheat: 7 (since we traded 1 Wheat in the last accepted trade)\n- Wood: 5\n- Sheep: 6 (since we traded 2 Sheep in the last accepted trade)\n- Brick: 8 (since we received 1 Brick in the last accepted trade)\n- Ore: 16 (since we traded 2 Ore, then 2 Ore, and finally 2 Ore in the previous offers, but only the last accepted trade didn't happen, so we actually traded 2 Ore in the first offer and 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat for 1 Brick)\n\nLet's correct the quantities based on the history:\n- Initial: Wheat = 8, Wood = 5, Sheep = 8, Brick = 7, Ore = 21\n- After first offer (3 Ore -> 2 Brick): Wheat = 8, Wood = 5, Sheep = 8, Brick = 7 (no change since it was rejected), Ore = 18\n- After second offer (2 Ore -> 2 Brick): Wheat = 8, Wood = 5, Sheep = 8, Brick = 7 (no change), Ore = 16\n- After third offer (2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick): Wheat = 7, Wood = 5, Sheep = 6, Brick = 8, Ore = 16\n- After subsequent offers: No further changes since they were either rejected or not made.\n\nSo, the correct current portfolio is:\n- Wheat: 7\n- Wood: 5\n- Sheep: 6\n- Brick: 8\n- Ore: 16\n\n#### Analysis:\n1. **Value of Resources**: \n   - Wheat: 6\n   - Wood: 12\n   - Sheep: 18\n   - Brick: 27\n   - Ore: 32\n\n2. **Trading History and Current State**:\n   - We've made several offers, with the last accepted trade being (2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick), improving our Brick quantity.\n   - Our offers for Ore in exchange for Brick or Wood were rejected.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to maximize our wealth.\n   - Since our last successful trade improved our Brick quantity, we should consider what we can offer next that is likely to be accepted.\n\n#### Next Move:\nLet's examine potential trades:\n- We can try to trade resources that are less valuable to us for those that are more valuable.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering Wheat (lower value) in exchange for Wood (higher value relative to Wheat). Let's propose:\n- **[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood]**\n\nThis trade gives away resources worth 12 (2 Wheat * 6) for a resource worth 12 (1 Wood * 12), which doesn't gain us much in terms of total value but does slightly adjust our portfolio. Let's adjust our strategy to be more beneficial.\n\nConsidering our resources and the values:\n- **[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood]** would be more beneficial as it trades 18 (1 Sheep) for 24 (2 Wood * 12), potentially gaining value.\n\nLet's choose a more strategic offer:\n- **[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Wood]**\n\nThis offer gives away (Sheep: 18 + Wheat: 6) = 24 for (2 Wood: 24), which is a fair trade in terms of total value but doesn't gain us much. However, adjusting slightly:\n- **[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]** could be more appealing as it trades 18 for 27, gaining 9 in value.\n\nLet's go with the more beneficial trade:\n**[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]**\n\n### Action:\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",
