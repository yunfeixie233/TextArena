      "response": "To determine the next step, let's first review the current situation and the outcome of the previous trade.\n\nInitially, my resource portfolio was:\n- Wheat: 25, Value: 6\n- Wood: 7, Value: 9\n- Sheep: 9, Value: 17\n- Brick: 8, Value: 23\n- Ore: 13, Value: 33\n\nI made an offer to Player 1: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`.\n\nSince Player 1 accepted the offer, the trade was executed. So, my new resource portfolio is:\n- Wheat: 25 - 4 = 21\n- Wood: 7 (unchanged)\n- Sheep: 9 (unchanged)\n- Brick: 8 (unchanged)\n- Ore: 13 + 1 = 14\n\nLet's calculate the value of my current portfolio:\n- Wheat: 21 * 6 = 126\n- Wood: 7 * 9 = 63\n- Sheep: 9 * 17 = 153\n- Brick: 8 * 23 = 184\n- Ore: 14 * 33 = 462\n\nTotal value = 126 + 63 + 153 + 184 + 462 = 988\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation to decide on the next action. Since Player 1 accepted my previous offer and didn't make a new one, I need to think about what I can offer that might be attractive to them or if I should wait for their next move.\n\nGiven that Ore is highly valued and I just acquired some, it might be wise to consider trading some of it for other resources that are relatively underrepresented in my portfolio or to balance it out. However, I should also be cautious not to devalue my portfolio.\n\nOne possible strategy is to look at the resources I have in abundance relative to their value and see if I can trade some of them for something more valuable or needed.\n\nMy next action will be to propose a trade. Noting the values, I have a significant amount of Wheat and Ore. Wood is relatively low in quantity. Let's consider trading some Wheat (since I still have a considerable amount and it's not the most valuable resource) for Wood (since it's one of the less abundant resources in my portfolio).\n\nSo, my offer could be: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 2 Wood]`.\n\nThis is a reasonable trade as it doesn't overly deplete my Wheat, and gaining Wood could be beneficial. The value I'm giving away is 3 * 6 = 18, and I'm getting 2 * 9 = 18 in return, making it a value-neutral trade.\n\nAction: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 2 Wood]`",

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the current situation and the history of trades.\n\n### Current Resource Portfolio:\n- Wheat: 25 - 4 (from the first trade) - 4 (from the second rejected offer) - 3 (from the third rejected offer) = 14\n- Wood: 7 - 2 (from the third rejected offer) = 5\n- Sheep: 9 - 2 (from the last rejected offer) = 7\n- Brick: 8 \n- Ore: 13 + 1 (from the first trade) = 14\n\n### Values:\n- Wheat: 6\n- Wood: 9\n- Sheep: 17\n- Brick: 23\n- Ore: 33\n\n### Wealth Calculation:\nInitial Wealth = (25*6) + (7*9) + (9*17) + (8*23) + (13*33) = 150 + 63 + 153 + 184 + 429 = 979  \nCurrent Wealth = (14*6) + (5*9) + (7*17) + (8*23) + (14*33) = 84 + 45 + 119 + 184 + 462 = 894  \n\n### Trade History:\n1. Player0 offered 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, and it was accepted.\n2. Player0 offered 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, but it was rejected.\n3. Player0 offered 3 Wheat and 2 Wood for 1 Brick, but it was rejected.\n4. Player1 offered 1 Brick for 3 Wheat and 2 Wood, but Player0 rejected it.\n5. Player0 offered 2 Sheep for 1 Brick, but it was rejected.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The last offer made by Player0 (2 Sheep for 1 Brick) was rejected. The value of this trade is (2*17) = 34 for (1*23) = 23. It doesn't seem like a good deal for Player0.\n- Player1's offer of 1 Brick for 3 Wheat and 2 Wood was rejected by Player0. Let's reassess: Giving up (3*6) + (2*9) = 18 + 18 = 36 for (1*23) = 23 is not beneficial.\n- We still have resources to negotiate.\n\n### Next Steps:\nLet's analyze potential trades. We're currently in Round ? (need to determine round number based on provided history) of 10.\n\n1. **Determine the current round:** From the history, we can see there were 5 trades or actions taken (3 offers made by Player0 and 2 relevant actions by Player1, including one acceptance and several rejections or no new offers). So, we're likely on or around the 5th or 6th round.\n\n2. **Formulate a new offer:**\nGiven our current resources and the goal to maximize wealth, let's consider making an offer that could be beneficial.\n\n- **Option 1:** Offer resources for Ore since it's high in value. We have Wheat, Wood, and Sheep that could be used. Let's consider: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]. The value given is (2*17) = 34, and the value received is (1*33) = 33. This is slightly unfavorable.\n  \n- **Option 2:** Consider a trade that involves Brick or Ore. Since we need to maximize wealth, let's directly think about proposing something that involves getting Ore or keeping our high-value resources.\n\nLet's directly analyze and propose a trade:\n- We can offer something of relatively lower value for something of higher value. For instance, offering Wheat or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nLet's make an offer: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]`.  \n- Giving up: (3*6) + (1*9) = 18 + 9 = 27  \n- Receiving: (1*33) = 33  \nThis seems like a potentially beneficial trade as we're gaining 6 in value.\n\nSo, the action is: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]`",

      "response": "Let's analyze the current situation and plan our next move.\n\n**Current Resource Portfolio:**\n- Wheat: 25 - 4 (previous trade) - 0 (other trades) = 21\n- Wood: 7\n- Sheep: 9 - 2 (previous offer) - 2 (other previous offer) = 5 (since both were rejected and didn't go through, we still have 9)\n- Brick: 8\n- Ore: 13 + 1 (from the accepted trade) = 14\n\nCorrecting the above with the actual changes:\n- Wheat: 25 - 4 = 21\n- Wood: 7\n- Sheep: 9\n- Brick: 8\n- Ore: 13 + 1 = 14\n\nLet's properly recount:\n1. Initial Wheat = 25, gave 4 Wheat, so 25 - 4 = 21.\n2. Then offered 4 Wheat again, didn't go through because it was rejected.\n3. Then offered 3 Wheat and 2 Wood for 1 Brick, didn't go through.\n4. Then received an offer for 3 Wheat and 2 Wood for 1 Brick, rejected it, so still 21 Wheat, 7 Wood.\n5. Other offers didn't involve Wheat or Wood.\n\nSo, the correct count is:\n- Wheat: 21\n- Wood: 7\n- Sheep: 9\n- Brick: 8\n- Ore: 14\n\n**Values:**\n- Wheat: 6\n- Wood: 9\n- Sheep: 17\n- Brick: 23\n- Ore: 33\n\n**Recent Trades and Offers:**\n1. We offered 4 Wheat for 1 Ore and it was accepted. (Done)\n2. We offered 4 Wheat for 1 Ore again, but it was rejected.\n3. We offered 3 Wheat and 2 Wood for 1 Brick, rejected.\n4. Received an offer for 1 Brick in exchange for 3 Wheat and 2 Wood, rejected.\n5. Offered 2 Sheep for 1 Brick, rejected.\n6. Offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, rejected.\n\n**Observations and Strategy:**\n- Player 1 accepted our initial offer of 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, indicating potential interest or need for Wheat or surplus of Ore.\n- Subsequent identical offers were rejected, so repeating the same offer may not be effective.\n- Both players have rejected each other's offers involving Wheat, Wood, and Brick, indicating a possible mismatch in perceived value or no immediate need.\n- Our offers involving Sheep for Brick or Ore were rejected, suggesting that either Player 1 doesn't have the requested resources or didn't value what we were offering.\n\n**Next Move:**\nLet's consider an alternative strategy that doesn't directly repeat previous offers but still utilizes the resources we have. We should look for a potentially beneficial trade based on the values and quantities we have.\n\nGiven that Ore is highly valued and we have a decent amount of it, let's consider making an offer that involves Ore this time from our side, to see if we can get a good deal.\n\nLet's offer 1 Ore for 2 Sheep: `[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep]`.\n\nAction: `[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep]`",
