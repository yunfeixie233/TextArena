The opponent made no new offer in the current turn. I need to make a new offer to continue, or state that I accept or deny a new offer if there was one.

The opponent accepted it, which is interesting.\n\nNow, I want to maximize my wealth. Ore is the most valuable resource. Brick is also valuable. Wood is less valuable.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood or Wheat for Ore or Brick.\nI have a lot of Wood and Sheep.\nI also have a decent amount of Wheat.\n\nLet's try to trade some Wood for Ore or Brick at a better ratio for me.\nMy wood is 12, Ore is 37.
