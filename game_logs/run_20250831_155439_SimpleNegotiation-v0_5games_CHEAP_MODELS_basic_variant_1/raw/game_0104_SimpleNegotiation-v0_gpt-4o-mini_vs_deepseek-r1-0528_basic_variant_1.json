Since my goal is to maximize wealth, accepting this offer would be detrimental.\n\n### Trading Strategy:\n- My resource portfolio has high-value Ore (23 units at 39) and Brick (25 at 26), making them the most valuable assets to retain or acquire. Low-value resources like Wood (22 at 9) and Sheep (21 at 12) are abundant but less impactful for wealth gains.\n- Trades must increase my wealth, meaning the value received must exceed the value given. However, rational trading requires mutual benefit, which is challenging due to the fixed resource values. Player 0 is also unlikely to accept trades where they lose wealth.\n- Player 0's offers indicate a pattern of seeking high-value Ore in exchange for low-value resources (Wood, Sheep, Wheat). This suggests they are trying to gain wealth at my expense, so accepting their proposal or making similar offers (e.g., swapping low-value resources for Ore) would risk losses.\n- Given the impossibility of crafting an offer that benefits me without being rejected by Player 0 (as it must be either unfavorable to them, or neutral with no wealth gain), I will not propose a trade. Any costly experiment might be exploited.\n\n### Decision:\nI deny Player 0's offer as it reduces my wealth. I will not make a counter-offer, as no beneficial trade can be constructed under current assumptions. Playing defensively preserves my wealth and avoids unnecessary losses.\n\nDeny\n\n[Deny]",
