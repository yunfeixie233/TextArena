My previous attempts to acquire Ore have been unsuccessful due to the opponent's reluctance to trade it, even in offers that were value-positive for them. My portfolio is heavily weighted toward Wheat (25 units, value 6 each) and Sheep (17 units, value 16 each), while high-value resources like Brick (29 value) and Ore (38 value) are more limited.\n\nGiven the opponent's rejection of multiple Ore-related trades, including offers that favored them, I will shift strategy to focus on converting low-value surplus resources (Wheat) into higher-value resources. Specifically, trading Wheat for Brick presents a viable opportunity: \n- Offering 5 Wheat for 1 Brick costs me 30 in value (5 \u00d7 6) and gains me 29 in Brick value, resulting in a small net loss of 1 value per trade. However, by reducing my Wheat surplus and increasing Brick holdings (which has the second-highest resource value), I can achieve better long-term value diversification. This trade also represents a slight value gain for the opponent (30 received vs. 29 given), increasing the likelihood of acceptance.\n\nI will now make this trade offer to the opponent.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
