      "response": "After analyzing my portfolio and the fixed resource values, I recognize that trading low-value resources like Wheat (5) or Wood (9) for high-value ones like Ore (36) or Brick (20) would increase my wealth. However, I lack visibility into my opponent's resources, making it challenging to propose an immediately appealing trade. As an initial offer, I'll prioritize liquidating excess Wheat while requesting a modest quantity of high-value Ore, ensuring the trade has a net positive value gain for me. If accepted, this would incrementally improve my position. I'll aim for a high-value resource as the target but keep the ask conservative to avoid rejection:\n\n**[Offer: 9 Wheat -> 1 Ore]**  \n- **I give**: 9 Wheat (value: 45)  \n- **I receive**: 1 Ore (value: 36)  \n- **My net gain**: -9 (temporary loss accepted to reduce low-value surplus)  \n\n*Rationale*:  \n- Wheat is my lowest-value resource (5) and abundant (12 units), making it ideal to offload.  \n- Ore commands the highest value (36), so acquiring even one unit strengthens my portfolio long-term.  \n- While I incur a minor short-term loss, this trade avoids overcommitting and signals flexibility for future rounds. If the opponent has Ore surplus, they might accept to gain extra Wheat.  \n\nIf this offer is rejected, I'll adjust in the next round by targeting Brick or Sheep trades.",
