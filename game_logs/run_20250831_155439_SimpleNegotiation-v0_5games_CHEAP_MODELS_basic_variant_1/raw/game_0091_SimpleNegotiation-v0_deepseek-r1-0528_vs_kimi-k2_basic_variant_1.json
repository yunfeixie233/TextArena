However, the inclusion of Wheat, a lower-value resource, may increase appeal compared to pure Wood offers.  \n- **Risk mitigation:** I have sufficient resources to spare (Wood: 15, Wheat: 7), and if rejected, I retain flexibility for future rounds.  \n- **Strategic intent:** Testing Player 1\u2019s willingness to trade Ore by leveraging the accepted pattern of Wood-based trades while adding diversification with Wheat.  \n\nThis offer aligns with my goal of aggressive wealth optimization while accounting for observed opponent behavior.
