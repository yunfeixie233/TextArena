Current portfolio value:  \n  - Wheat (23 \u00d7 5 = 115)  \n  - Wood (14 \u00d7 9 = 126)  \n  - Sheep (7 \u00d7 17 = 119)  \n  - Brick (14 \u00d7 28 = 392)  \n  - Ore (10 \u00d7 36 = 360)  \n  Total: **1,112**  \n- **Trade Insight:**  \n  - Player 0 consistently seeks Ore (declined offers: 5 Wheat\u2192Ore, 4 Wood\u2192Ore). They likely value Ore and have Wood surplus.  \n  - Proposed trade: Give 1 Ore (value 36), receive 4 Wood (4\u00d79=36) + 1 Wheat (value 5). Net gain: **+5 value** (41 received vs. 36 given).  \n- **Risk Mitigation:**  \n  - Current Ore (10) is sufficient for strategic trades; acquiring extra Wheat/Wood diversifies assets.  \n  - Wheat (23) is undervalued but adding 1 unit at no cost (via trade bonus) improves wealth.  \n- **Historical Context:** Player 0 rejected 1 Ore for 5 Wood. This adjusted offer (4 Wood + 1 Wheat) lowers their Wood cost while adding minor Wheat, making acceptance more plausible.  \n\nThis offer exploits Player 0's Ore demand while ensuring Player 1 gains value, aligning with wealth-maximization goals.",

Wheat is my least valuable resource (5 per unit), and its surplus (23) reduces my portfolio efficiency. Brick holds high value (28 per unit), but I have moderate supply (14).
