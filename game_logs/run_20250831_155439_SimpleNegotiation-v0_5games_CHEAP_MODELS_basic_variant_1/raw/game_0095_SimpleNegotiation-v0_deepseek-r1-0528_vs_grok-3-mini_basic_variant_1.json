This trade increases my wealth by net +6 value (40 - 34). It\u2019s a profitable exchange, and I have ample Sheep (17 currently) to continue trading.  \n- **New Offer:** I propose **2 Sheep for 1 Ore**, mirroring Player 1\u2019s accepted rate. Sheep are my least valuable resource (17 each), while Ore is the highest (40). Converting Sheep to Ore maximizes value efficiency. With 15 Sheep remaining after the accepted trade, I can afford this offer and still retain flexibility. Player 1 has consistently engaged at this rate, suggesting they value Sheep.  \n\n**Considerations:**  \n- **Wealth Focus:** Ore\u2019s high value (40) accelerates wealth growth compared to Sheep (17) or Wheat (6).  \n- **Risk Control:** Keeping Sheep above 10 ensures I can propose more trades.  \n- **Leverage History:** Player 1 has accepted/offered this trade 3 times\u2014I exploit this pattern.  \n\nLet\u2019s trade! \ud83d\ude80",
