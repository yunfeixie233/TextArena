      "response": "### Analysis of Current Situation\nAs Player 0, my goal is to maximize my wealth, which is calculated based on the fixed values per resource: Wheat (6), Wood (9), Sheep (14), Brick (30), Ore (32). My current portfolio wealth is:\n- 11 Wheat \u00d7 6 = 66\n- 8 Wood \u00d7 9 = 72\n- 6 Sheep \u00d7 14 = 84\n- 17 Brick \u00d7 30 = 510\n- 22 Ore \u00d7 32 = 704  \nTotal: 66 + 72 + 84 + 510 + 704 = 1,436\n\nTo increase wealth, I should trade to:\n- Give resources with lower value per unit (e.g., Wheat or Wood) to minimize loss.\n- Receive resources with higher value per unit (e.g., Ore or Brick) to maximize gain.\nSince Ore has the highest value (32) and I have a surplus of Wheat (11), I can propose a trade where I give Wheat for Ore. A reasonable first offer is:\n- Give 5 Wheat (total value to me: 30) to receive 1 Ore (value to me: 32), resulting in a net wealth gain of 2 if accepted.\nThis trade is balanced on common value assumptions (5 Wheat = 30 vs. 1 Ore = 32), making it potentially acceptable to Player 1, as the small deficit might be overlooked in a first-round negotiation.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer aims to test Player 1's willingness to trade high-value resources for bulk low-value goods. If rejected, I can adjust in future rounds based on their response.",
