      "response": "### Current Situation Analysis\n\nLet's break down the current state and the previous interactions:\n\n**My Resources:**\n- Wheat: 8 (value 6)\n- Wood: 7 (value 10)\n- Sheep: 25 (value 17)\n- Brick: 9 (value 20)\n- Ore: 25 (value 37)\n\n**Total Value Calculation:**\n- Wheat: 8 * 6 = 48\n- Wood: 7 * 10 = 70\n- Sheep: 25 * 17 = 425\n- Brick: 9 * 20 = 180\n- Ore: 25 * 37 = 925\n- **Total Wealth: 48 + 70 + 425 + 180 + 925 = 1648**\n\n**Opponent's Previous Offers:**\n1. Offer: 4 Wood, 3 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore\n   - They give: 4 Wood (4*10=40) + 3 Wheat (3*6=18) = 58\n   - They want: 1 Ore (1*37=37)\n   - Net for me: -58 + 37 = -21 (bad deal, rejected)\n\n2. Offer: 1 Brick \u2192 2 Ore\n   - They give: 1 Brick (1*20=20)\n   - They want: 2 Ore (2*37=74)\n   - Net for me: +20 -74 = -54 (bad deal, rejected)\n\n3. Offer: 1 Brick \u2192 1 Ore\n   - They give: 1 Brick (1*20=20)\n   - They want: 1 Ore (1*37=37)\n   - Net for me: +20 -37 = -17 (bad deal, rejected)\n\n**My Previous Offer:**\n4 Ore \u2192 5 Brick\n   - I give: 4 Ore (4*37=148)\n   - I want: 5 Brick (5*20=100)\n   - Net for me: -148 +100 = -48 (bad for me, likely why they rejected)\n\n### Strategy Going Forward\n\nThe opponent seems to be trying to acquire Ore at unfavorable rates for me. My Ore is my most valuable resource at 37 per unit, and I have 25, which is quite a lot. Brick is also valuable at 20, and I have only 9. \n\n**Observations:**\n- The opponent is low on Ore (likely, given their offers trying to get Ore).\n- They have Brick and are willing to trade it for Ore, but at bad rates (1 Brick for 1 or 2 Ore is way off).\n\n**Goal:** Maximize wealth. Since Ore is valuable, I should avoid trading it away unless getting a very good deal. Brick is also good, and I might want more of it if the rate is good.\n\n### New Offer to Make\n\nGiven that the opponent seems to want Ore, I should try to trade away less valuable resources for more valuable ones. My Sheep (17) and Wheat (6) are less valuable than Ore (37), so I could try to trade these for Ore or Brick.\n\nHowever, looking at the opponent's offers, they seem to want to give Brick for Ore, which is not good for me. Maybe I can try the reverse: offer Brick for Ore at a good rate for me.\n\nBut they rejected my 4 Ore \u2192 5 Brick (which was -48 for me, good for them), so they don't seem to value Brick as highly as to give up Ore for it.\n\nAlternative: Offer to trade my lower-value resources for their Ore or Brick at favorable rates for me.\n\n**New Offer Idea:**\nI have excess Sheep (25) which is at 17 value. Perhaps offer sheep for brick.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\n- I give: 3 Sheep (3*17=51)\n- I want: 1 Brick (1*20=20)\n- Net for me: -51 +20 = -31 (bad for me, would need more brick per sheep)\n\nAlternatively, try to get Ore for Sheep:\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n- I give: 1 Sheep (17)\n- I want: 1 Ore (37)\n- Net for me: +20 (good for me, but they likely wouldn't accept)\n\nThey wouldn't take this as it's too good for me.\n\nAnother angle: Since they want Ore, maybe offer to give away a little Ore for a lot of their Brick to balance my portfolio.\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 5 Brick]\n- I give: 2 Ore (2*37=74)\n- I want: 5 Brick (5*20=100)\n- Net for me: -74 +100 = +26 (good for me)\n\nThis seems reasonable. They get Ore (which they want), I get more Brick which is valuable and I only have 9. The rate is 1 Ore for 2.5 Brick, which is better than their offers of 1 Brick for 1 or 2 Ore.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nI'll go with the offer that gives me Brick in exchange for Ore at a good rate, as I have plenty of Ore (25) and only 9 Brick.\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 5 Brick]",
