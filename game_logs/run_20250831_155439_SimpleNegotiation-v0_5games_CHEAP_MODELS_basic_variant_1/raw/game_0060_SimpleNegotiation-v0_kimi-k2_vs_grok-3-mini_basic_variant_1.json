      "response": "I\u2019m ready\u2014Player 0 is online.  \nLet me first appraise my position:\n\nMy current net-worth  \n20 Wheat\u00d76   = 120  \n8 Wood\u00d710    =  80  \n20 Sheep\u00d713  = 260  \n9 Brick\u00d723   = 207  \n15 Ore\u00d733    = 495  \nTOTAL        = 1 162 value-units\n\nOre is my most precious commodity, Brick a close second. Wheat is abundant but very low value. Wood is my scarcest resource.\n\nOff-balance-sheet strength  \n- I have far more high-value Ore & Brick than I can ever burn internally, so modest outbound shipments of Ore are acceptable\u2014provided the premium compensates for both lost future utility and the opponent\u2019s gain.  \n- I have a huge over-supply of Sheep and Wheat; these are ideal \u201cbuy-me-now\u201d currencies.  \n- Wood is the critical choke-point: only 8 units. Personally I value Wood higher than its nominal 10 pts\u2014losing even 2 hurts.\n\nDesired long-run shifts  \nBring Wood count up to ~12\u201315 while keeping Ore around 10\u201312 and Brick around 6\u20137. Dump at least half of the Sheep and half of the Wheat over the next 10 rounds.\n\nOpening leverage  \n- My opponent sees 15 shiny Ore; have to signal that Ore is for sale only at premium prices so they don\u2019t try to low-ball early.  \n- An imbalance of knowledge: they probably undervalue my surplus Sheep/Wheat because those numbers appear flimsy. I can use them as \u201cfiller\u201d to disguise a Wood grab.\n\nRound-1 offer plan  \nI\u2019ll put out a test bid that:\n\n1. Gives them indulgent Sheep and Wheat (both in oversupply).  \n2. Charges the market price for Ore, but cloaks it by asking for Wood + Brick.  \n3. Keeps my Ore exposure low (only 2 units).\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 3 Wood, 2 Ore]\n\nAnalysis of terms for opponent  \nThey receive 3\u00d713 + 2\u00d76 + 23 = 77 value.  \nThey give away 3\u00d710 + 2\u00d733 = 96 value.  \nNominal surplus flows toward me (+19 value units), yet to them only one Ore and the promise of more Sheep/Wheat in future trades\u2014likely attractive on a quick scan.\n\nI\u2019m now awaiting their response or alternative proposal.",

Likely opponent felt it was unfavorable.  \n\n4. **Strategy Adjustment**:  \n   - I need Wood (only 8 units) and Ore (high value).  \n   - Opponent seems to value Ore highly (asking 3 Wood for 1 Ore).  \n   - Try offering fewer high-value items for Ore/Wood to seem less demanding.  \n\n5. **New Offer**:  \n   - Offer something less valuable but still appealing.  \n   - Try: 1 Brick (23) -> 1 Ore (33). This is a net loss of 10 for me but might tempt opponent (Ore is expensive).  \n   - Alternatively, offer Wood for Ore if I need Ore more. But I have little Wood to spare.  \n\n6. **Best New Offer**:  \n   - Offer: 2 Sheep (26) -> 1 Ore (33).  \n   - Net loss = 33 - 26 = 7 (small loss for me, but gets Ore).  \n   - Sheep is plentiful (20), and Ore is scarce (15).  \n\nFinal answer: `[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`",

Their proposed ratio (3 Wood = 30 value for 1 Ore = 33 value) is 0.91 to 1 in my favor\u2014basically fair and the best I\u2019ve seen so far. Getting 3 Wood would ease my tightest bottleneck without noticeably hurting my dominant Ore supply.\n\n[Accept]",
