However, we need to adjust our response because we cannot fulfill the request exactly due to the shortage of Wheat and Ore.\n\nLet's calculate what we can offer:\n- We can give 6 Wood (have 13), 5 Wheat (have 5), and 6 Ore (have 6).\n\nSo, a possible counteroffer could be: [Offer: 6 Wood, 5 Wheat, 6 Ore -> 12 Brick, 25 Sheep].\n\nHowever, since we can't directly accept or modify the given offer without using the specified commands, and we are short on Wheat and Ore, we should either accept the deal if we were willing to negotiate further or deny it.\n\nLet's first check if we can make a counteroffer that is more feasible with our resources.\n\nGiven our resources:\n- We can give away 6 Ore (all we have), 5 Wheat (all we have), and up to 6 Wood (out of 13).\n\nA potential offer that fits within our means and is somewhat aligned with the original request (though scaled down) could be: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 6 Ore, 6 Wood -> 25 Sheep, 12 Brick].\n\nLet's directly analyze the given offer and respond according to the instructions.\n\nSince we can't fulfill the exact request due to lack of Wheat and Ore, and the instructions do not directly allow for a modification of the offer, a more straightforward response is needed.\n\nTo follow the instructions directly and strategically, a counteroffer seems like a reasonable step, but let's directly use the format given.\n\nGiven that we have enough Wood but lack Wheat and Ore to fulfill the request, a simple denial or a counteroffer reflecting our capability is needed.\n\nLet's frame a response: \n[Offer: 6 Wood, 5 Wheat, 6 Ore -> 12 Brick, 10 Sheep]\n\nThis offer utilizes the resources we have and proposes a trade. Adjusting for a more realistic Sheep quantity that Player 0 might accept is considered.\n\nHowever, to directly follow the given format and instructions without complicating the response:\nThe best response, given the constraints and aiming to maximize wealth, is to make a counteroffer that we can fulfill.\n\nSo, I'll directly respond with a feasible counteroffer.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 6 Ore, 6 Wood -> 12 Brick, 10 Sheep]",

Let's analyze the offer made by Player 0 to understand its implications:\n- Player 0 is offering 25 Sheep and 12 Brick.\n- Player 0 is requesting 7 Ore, 15 Wheat, and 6 Wood.\n\nGiven the quantities:\n- We don't have enough Wheat (need 15, have 5) or Ore (need 7, have 6) to fulfill the request as is.\n- The request for 6 Wood is something we can fulfill since we have 13 Wood.\n\nLet's examine the value of the resources involved in the last offer from Player 0:\n- **Offered by Player 0:** 25 Sheep (Value: 15 each = 375), 12 Brick (Value: 23 each = 276), Total Value = 651\n- **Requested by Player 0:** 7 Ore (Value: 32 each = 224), 15 Wheat (Value: 5 each = 75), 6 Wood (Value: 12 each = 72), Total Value = 371\n\nThe total value offered is greater than what's requested, indicating a potentially favorable trade for us if we had the resources to fulfill the request.\n\nLet's assess our ability to make a new offer or respond. Since we can't fulfill the original request due to insufficient Wheat and almost enough Ore, we should consider adjusting our strategy.\n\n**New Offer Strategy:**\nTo maximize our wealth, we should aim to give away resources that are less valuable to us relative to what we receive. Let's directly analyze our resources and see if we can make a reasonable offer.\n\nWe have:\n- A surplus of Brick (16) and Wood (13) relative to other resources like Wheat (5) and Ore (6).\n\nConsidering the values:\n- Brick (Value: 23) and Sheep (Value: 15) are relatively high-value resources we have in decent quantities.\n\nLet's make a new offer that could be attractive:\n- We could offer some Brick or Sheep for resources that are more valuable or that we are running low on.\n\n**Proposed Action:**\nSince we lack Wheat and have a good amount of Brick, let's think about getting Wheat. We can offer some Brick for Wheat or other valuable resources.\n\nLet's make an offer: `[Offer: 8 Brick -> 4 Wheat, 2 Ore]`\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 8 Brick, -> 4 Wheat, 2 Ore]`\n\nLet's format it correctly as per the instructions: `[Offer: 8 Brick -> 4 Wheat, 2 Ore]`\n\n**Action:**\n`[Offer: 8 Brick -> 4 Wheat, 2 Ore]`",
