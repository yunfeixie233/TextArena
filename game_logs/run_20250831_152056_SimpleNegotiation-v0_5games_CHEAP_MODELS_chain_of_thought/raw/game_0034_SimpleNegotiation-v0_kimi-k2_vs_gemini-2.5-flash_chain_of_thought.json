      "response": "Alright, let\u2019s think strategically about what\u2019s good (and bad) for me.\n\n1. Current total value  \n   Wheat 5 + Wood 11 + Sheep 12 + Brick 26 + Ore 33 = 87 points.\n\n2. Marginal values (value per unit)  \n   Wheat 1.0, Wood \u22480.61, Sheep 2.4, Brick \u22481.86, Ore \u22481.57.  \n   Sheep and Brick are the \u201chigh-margin\u201d resources; Wood by far the worst.\n\n3. Objective  \n   Boost total value. The simplest way is to  \n   - Move out of low-margin resources (Wood, Wheat) into anything else.  \n   - Move into high-margin resources (Sheep & Brick).  \n   - Ore is decent and bulky\u2014I can spare it to grab Sheep/Brick without touching Wheat/Wood if possible, but am willing to dump Wood or Wheat.\n\n4. My surpluses vs. shortages  \n   I\u2019m long on Ore (21) and extremely long on Wood (18).  \n   I only have 5 of both Wheat and Sheep\u2014so I\u2019d like to *increase* Wheat beyond 5 or Sheep beyond 5 rather than shrink them.\n\n5. What might the opponent want?  \n   They only start with a few resources of each type (2,2,4,3,3). They probably value diversification and may be short on ore or brick (both powerful resources). Their biggest stockpile is 4 Sheep, so Wood or Ore might be attractive in exchange for Brick/Sheep.\n\n6. Partitioning the trade space  \n   A. I\u2019m happy to give Wood and/or Ore.  \n   B. I\u2019m happy to receive Brick and/or Sheep (Brick especially).  \n   C. I\u2019d give Wheat only if I get Sheep or Brick back.  \n   D. I aim for at least 2 : 1 value gain (since I start the de-legation as offerer).\n\n7. Picking an offer  \n   Ask for Brick (high margin) and be generous with what I have plenty of.\n\n   Example 1: Exact equal value  \n   Offer Wood 5 (5 \u00d7 0.61 \u2248 3.05 value). Ask Brick 2 (2 \u00d7 1.86 \u2248 3.71 value). Net +0.66 in my favor\u2014small but safe.  \n\n   But I have tons of Wood, so I can afford to overpay slightly to make the deal juicy.  \n   Offer Wood 6 (\u22483.7 value). Ask Brick 2 (\u22483.7 value) \u21e8 even swap, tempting for them.\n\n   Example 2 (bolder): give Ore the opponent craves, get excess Brick.  \n   Offer Ore 4 (4 \u00d7 1.57 \u2248 6.3 value). Ask Brick 3 + Sheep 1 (3 \u00d7 1.86 + 1 \u00d7 2.4 \u2248 8.0 value). Net +1.7.  \n\n   But simplifying keeps the message clear for first move:\n\n   I\u2019ll give 6 Wood for 2 Brick.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wood -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "My current resources and their values are:\nRegal Resources:\n  - Wheat: 23 @ 5 value/unit = 115\n  - Wood: 21 @ 10 value/unit = 210\n  - Sheep: 17 @ 13 value/unit = 221\n  - Brick: 21 @ 29 value/unit = 609\n  - Ore: 18 @ 35 value/unit = 630\nTotal value: 1785\n\nGoal: Increase the total value of my resources.\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 6 Wood (value: 6 * 10 = 60)\nPlayer 0 requested: 2 Brick (value: 2 * 29 = 58)\n\nEvaluating the offer:\nValue I lose: 6 Wood = 60\nValue I gain: 2 Brick = 58\nNet change in value for me: 58 - 60 = -2\n\nThis offer would decrease my total resource value, so I should not accept it as is.\n\nWhat my opponent might be thinking:\nPlayer 0 is offering 6 Wood for 2 Brick. This suggests they value Brick more than Wood, or they have an abundance of Wood and need Brick. The trade is slightly unfavorable to me (-2 value), but it's close. This suggests Player 0 is trying to make a fair trade, but it doesn't align with my goal of increasing overall value.\n\nDecision factors:\n1. Does the trade increase my total resource value? (No, for this offer)\n2. Do I have an abundance of the offered resource? (I have 21 Wood, so it's not super abundant but not scarce either)\n3. Do I need the requested resource? (I have 21 Brick, which is a good quantity, but Brick is a high-value item, so more is generally good if the trade is favorable).\n\nSince this offer decreases my value, I will deny it. Instead, I want to make a counter-offer that increases my value.\n\nI have a decent quantity of Wheat and Wood, which are my lowest value resources per unit. I have reasonable quantities of Sheep, Brick, and Ore, which are my higher value resources.\n\nI want to acquire more of the high-value items (Brick, Ore) by trading away lower-value items (Wheat, Wood, possibly Sheep if the trade is very good).\n\nLet's consider possible counter-offers based on Player 0's offer. They want Brick and are offering Wood.\nPerhaps I can offer Wood for Brick, but at a more favorable ratio for me.\nPlayer 0 offered 6 Wood for 2 Brick (3 Wood per Brick).\nIf I offered 5 Wood for 2 Brick (2.5 Wood per Brick), that would be better for me.\nValue lost: 5 Wood * 10 = 50\nValue gained: 2 Brick * 29 = 58\nNet gain: +8. This is a positive value trade.\n\nLet's also consider shedding off some Wheat for higher value items.\nI have a lot of Wheat (23 Qty, 5 Value).\nIf I offered, for example, 10 Wheat (Value 50) for 1 Brick (Value 29). This is a bad trade for me.\nBut if I offered 10 Wheat for 2 Brick (Value 58), net gain is +8.\nOr 10 Wheat (Value 50) for 2 Sheep (Value 26). Bad trade.\nOr 10 Wheat for 1 Ore (Value 35). Bad trade.\n\nGiven that Player 0 just offered Wood for Brick, a counter-offer involving those resources might be accepted.\nMy proposed counter-offer: 5 Wood for 2 Brick.\nValue of 5 Wood = 5 * 10 = 50\nValue of 2 Brick = 2 * 29 = 58\nThis would increase my total value by 8.\n\nI'll wait to see if Player 0 counter-offers me after I deny, or if they propose a new trade. It's my turn to make an offer.\n\nMy action will be to make an offer that increases my value.\nI want to get higher value items for lower value items.\nI have 21 Wood at Value 10.\nI have 21 Brick at Value 29. Player 0 desired Brick.\n\nLet's offer to trade some Wood for Brick, but at a better rate for me than what Player 0 proposed.\nPlayer 0 offered 6 Wood for 2 Brick (3 Wood/1 Brick)\nI will offer 5 Wood for 2 Brick. This is 2.5 Wood/1 Brick.\nValue of 5 Wood = 50. Value of 2 Brick = 58. Net gain = +8.\n\nStep-by-step thinking:\n1. Analyze Player 0's offer: 6 Wood (60) for 2 Brick (58). Result: -2 value for me. Deny.\n2. Formulate my own offer: My goal is to increase my resource value. I should offer low-value resources for high-value resources.\n3. Player 0 showed interest in Brick and has Wood to offer. This suggests a negotiation around Wood and Brick.\n4. I have 21 Wood and 21 Brick. Both are in decent quantity.\n5. What ratio is favorable to me? I want to give up less value than I gain.\n6. If I trade 5 Wood (Value 50) for 2 Brick (Value 58), my total value increases by 8. This is a good trade.\n7. This counter-offer is also \"cheaper\" for Player 0 to acquire 2 Brick compared to their previous offer (they would give 5 Wood instead of 6 Wood). This might incentivize them to accept it.\n\nFinal Decision: Deny Player 0's offer, and then make my own offer.\nWait, since I am Player 1, Player 0 made an offer to me. My decision can only be to accept, deny, or propose a counter-offer. In this game format, I think the appropriate action is to simply 'Deny' the offer if it's bad, and then the turn passes to me. This implies the next turn I can then make my own offer. The instructions aren't totally clear if I can deny and then immediately make an offer in the same turn. \"Use the following special tokens for actions: - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]' - '[Accept]' - '[Deny]'\" This implies only one action per turn. So if I deny, then I do not get to make an offer.\n\nNo, the problem states \"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1\". I am Player 1. My turn. So my choices are to [Accept] or [Deny] this offer. If I [Deny], then the game proceeds to the next turn, and Player 1 will get a chance to make their own offer. I should **not** make an offer in response to an incoming offer, unless the format allows it explicitly (which it does not).\nTherefore, my action is simply to Deny the current offer.\n\nMy reasoning step-by-step:\n1. Understand the incoming offer: Player 0 offered 6 Wood for 2 Brick.\n2. Calculate the value change for myself:\n    - Value of 6 Wood (what I lose): 6 * 10 = 60\n    - Value of 2 Brick (what I gain): 2 * 29 = 58\n    - Net change: 58 - 60 = -2.\n3. Evaluate against my goal: My goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This offer decreases my value.\n4. Conclusion: I should not accept this offer.\n\nI will simply Deny the offer. I will make my advantageous offer on my next turn.\n[Deny]",

End-of-round summary of what just happened  \n   \u2022 I gave up 6 Wood, got 2 Brick.  \n   \u2022 My opponent has placed a new offer on the table: they want to give 3 Sheep + 2 Ore in exchange for 5 Brick + 2 Sheep.\n\n2.

Player 0 rejected this offer. This might indicate that Player 0 does not have a large surplus of Brick or doesn't value Sheep that much, or perhaps they saw the significant value gain for me.\n\nPlayer 0 previously offered 6 Wood (6*10=60) for 2 Brick (2*29=58) which I accepted. This was a loss of 2 value for me, but it was accepted to initiate trading and potentially reveal Player 0's needs. It seems Player 0 might be in need of Wood or trying to offload Brick, or perhaps they needed a specific quantity of Brick.\n\nNow, Player 0 made no new trade offer. This means it is my turn to initiate.\n\nI want to avoid trading away my high-value resources (Ore, Brick) unless I can get a much larger value in return. My focus should be on converting low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) into high-value resources.\n\nLet's consider what Player 0 might need. If they offered Wood for Brick, they might have a surplus of Wood and need Brick. However, they rejected my offer which included a request for Brick. This suggests they might not have a huge surplus of Brick to give away, or they value it highly.\n\nLet's look at my lowest value resources: Wheat (5) and Wood (10). I have significant quantities of both (23 Wheat, 21 Wood).\n\nPossible strategies:\n1.  **Trade Wheat for high-value resources**: This would be the most efficient value gain, but Wheat might not be highly sought after.\n2.  **Trade Wood for high-value resources**: Wood has a slightly better value than Wheat, and was previously accepted by Player 0 (though I took a minor loss).\n3.  **Trade Sheep for high-value resources**: Sheep has a moderate value. I have 17.\n\nI want to make an offer that is attractive to Player 0 while still providing me with a significant value gain.\nPlayer 0 accepted 6 Wood for 2 Brick. This suggests they might value Brick strongly and might be willing to trade Wood for it. However, the previous reject for Brick might contradict this.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the previous offer: 3 Sheep (39), 2 Ore (70) -> 5 Brick (145), 2 Sheep (26). Total value out = 109, Total value in = 171. A gain of 62. This was a very greedy offer on my part.\n\nI need to make a more balanced offer, offering items that I have in surplus and are low value to me, for items that are high value to me.\n\nLet's try to offer Wood or Wheat for Brick or Ore.\nIf I offer Wood for Brick:\nCurrent value of Wood = 10. Current value of Brick = 29. Ratio is almost 3:1.\nIf I offer say, 6 Wood (60 value) for 2 Brick (58 value). This is essentially the trade Player 0 made, but I want to gain value.\nHow about 7 Wood (70 value) for 2 Brick (58 value)? This is a loss for me. Not good.\n\nPerhaps Player 0 values Wood highly? They did accept my 6 Wood.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of a low-value item for a small quantity of a high-value item?\n\nConsider 10 Wood (100 value). For what could I trade it to gain value?\n*   3 Brick (3 * 29 = 87). This is a loss.\n*   4 Brick (4 * 29 = 116). This is a gain of 16. This is a decent target.\n*   3 Ore (3 * 35 = 105). This is a gain of 5.\n\nLet's try offering Wood for Brick, aiming for a modest value gain that might be acceptable to Player 0.\nPrevious rejection of my Brick request suggests Brick might be somewhat constrained for P0.\n\nWhat if I offer low-value Wheat?\n20 Wheat (20 * 5 = 100).\n*   3 Brick (87) - Loss\n*   4 Brick (116) - Gain of 16. This is attractive for me. But 20 Wheat is a lot.\n\nPerhaps a mixed offer or a smaller quantity.\n\nLet's try to offer a mix of Wood and Sheep for Brick or Ore.\nPlayer 0 didn't offer anything last turn, maybe they are evaluating their options or have no specific needs right now.\nI still have 23 Wheat, 21 Wood, 17 Sheep, 21 Brick, 18 Ore.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, since it's my highest value resource.\nIf I offer 10 Wood (100 value) for 3 Ore (105 value). This is a gain of 5. This is a small gain, but potentially more palatable for Player 0.\nWhat if Player 0 doesn't have much Ore?\n\nLet's consider offering Wheat since it's my lowest value resource.\nI have 23 Wheat. Suppose I offer 15 Wheat (15 * 5 = 75 value).\n*   For 2 Brick (2 * 29 = 58). This is a significant loss for me.\n*   For 3 Brick (3 * 29 = 87). This is a gain of 12. This is good for me. But is 15 Wheat for 3 Brick a fair offer for Player 0? If P0 needs Wheat or doesn't need Brick.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio of values.\nWheat: 5\nWood: 10\nSheep: 13\nBrick: 29\nOre: 35\n\nIf I offer X amount of Wheat for Y amount of Brick, I want: Y * 29 > X * 5.\nExample: 15 Wheat (75) vs. 3 Brick (87). Good for me. Ratio is 15:3 or 5:1.\nValue ratio 29:5, so I'd need to offer 5.8 Wheat for 1 Brick to break even. So 5 Wheat for 1 Brick is a steal for them, 6 Wheat for 1 Brick is slightly in my favor etc.\n\nIf I offer 5 Wheat for 1 Brick: My cost = 25, Their cost = 29. I gain 4. This is a small trade, but possible.\nIf I offer 10 Wheat for 2 Brick: My cost = 50, Their cost = 58. I gain 8. Also small, but reasonable.\nThis seems like a good, low-risk way to gain value.\nI have 23 Wheat. Offering 10 Wheat is less than half my stock.\n\nWhat if P0 needs Wood and not Wheat? They previously accepted Wood.\nLet's make an offer involving Wood.\nMy goal is to obtain higher value resources (Brick/Ore) by giving away lower value resources (Wood/Wheat/Sheep).\n\nConsider offering a good quantity of Wood for some Brick or Ore.\nI have 21 Wood.\nHow about offering 10 Wood (100 value) for 3 Brick (87 value)? This is a loss.\nHow about 10 Wood (100 value) for 4 Brick (116 value)? This is a gain of 16. This is a good gain.\nIs 10 Wood for 4 Brick reasonable for P0? It means P0 gives up 116 value to get 100 value. P0 loses 16 value.\nThis is probably too greedy on my part, given their past rejection of my Brick request.\n\nLet's try to make a profitable but not too greedy offer.\nMaybe a 1 for 1 trade, but I get the higher value item, by offering a resource of similar tier.\ne.g., 3 Sheep for 1 Brick? (3*13=39) vs (1*29=29). I'd lose 10. Not good.\nHow about 2 Sheep (26) for 1 Wood (10)? I lose a lot. No.\n\nI need to drive value up.\nMy last accepted trade was 6 Wood for 2 Brick (loss of 2 value).\nMy last rejected trade was 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep (gain of 62 value for me). This was very ambitious.\n\nSo my acceptable range for mutual trades seems very narrow if Player 0 is not willing to give up much value.\n\nLet's reconsider the 10 Wheat for 2 Brick trade.\nMy value out: 10 Wheat * 5 = 50\nMy value in: 2 Brick * 29 = 58\nMy gain: +8 value.\nThis is a small but positive gain for me.\nFrom Player 0's perspective: They get 50 value from me, give 58 value. So they lose 8 value.\nThis is a direct mirror of my previous accepted trade where I lost 2 value. But this time, it's 8 value.\nIs losing 8 value acceptable for P0? Likely not if their objective is also to gain value.\n\nThis suggests that I should offer something closer to a balanced trade, where I gain a small amount, and P0 loses a small amount, or where P0 gains slightly.\nIf P0 values specific resources for some reason (e.g., building costs in Settlers of Catan), then the raw value might not be the only factor.\n\nLet's try an offer that leverages my high quantity of Wood/Wheat and aims for a reasonable value gain, trying to reduce the value loss for Player 0.\n\nOffer: 6 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 3 Brick\nMy value out: 6*10 + 5*5 = 60 + 25 = 85\nMy value in: 3*29 = 87\nMy gain: +2 value. This is very small for me but also very small loss for P0 (-2 value for P0). This makes it very likely to be accepted.\nIt utilizes my two lowest valuable resources. And I still have plenty of both (15 Wood, 18 Wheat left).\nThis aligns with the previous trade where I accepted a loss of 2. It signals willingness to engage in near-even trades for specific resources. Player 0 may need Brick.\n\nLet's go for this: a low gain for me, low loss for Player 0. It's a plausible trade that benefits me slightly and could be accepted if Player 0 needs Brick or wants to offload Wood/Wheat. My earlier accepted trade of 6 Wood for 2 Brick (Player 0 gain 2, I lose 2) shows this kind of symmetric near-even trade can work.\nThis trade is 6 Wood + 5 Wheat (85 value) for 3 Brick (87 value).\nThis increases my total value by 2. It's not a huge increase per turn, but it's consistent.\n\nFinal check:\nResources to offer: 6 Wood, 5 Wheat\nValue of offered resources: (6 * 10) + (5 * 5) = 60 + 25 = 85\nResources to request: 3 Brick\nValue of requested resources: 3 * 29 = 87\nNet change for me: +2 value.\n\nThis is a very small value gain for me, but it feels like a very reasonable offer that Player 0 might accept. It's much less aggressive than my previous offer. It could also reveal if Player 0 has a strong need for Brick or if they are low on Brick.\n\n```\n[Offer: 6 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 3 Brick]\n```",

      "response": "Alright, I'm Player 0 in this Negotiation Game. Let me start by carefully analyzing my initial position and then see how the trades so far have affected my standing.\n\n### Initial Situation Analysis\n**Resources I started with:**\n- Wheat: 5 qty, total value = 25 (since value is per unit, I think it's 5 value per qty? Wait, no. The format says \"Value: 5\" next to Wheat with Qty: 5. So total value is 5, not 25. That would mean value per unit is 1 for Wheat. Same for others:\n  - Wheat: Qty 5, total Value 5 \u2192 Value per unit = 1\n  - Wood: Qty 18, total Value 11 \u2192 Value per unit \u2248 0.61\n  - Sheep: Qty 5, total Value 12 \u2192 Value per unit = 2.4\n  - Brick: Qty 14, total Value 26 \u2192 Value per unit \u2248 1.857\n  - Ore: Qty 21, total Value 33 \u2192 Value per unit \u2248 1.571\n\n**Initial total value:**\n5 (Wheat) + 11 (Wood) + 12 (Sheep) + 26 (Brick) + 33 (Ore) = 87\n\n### Trades So Far\n1. **My Offer**: 6 Wood \u2192 2 Brick\n   - Before: 18 Wood, 14 Brick\n   - After: 12 Wood, 16 Brick\n   - Value change:\n     - Lost Wood: 6 * (11/18) \u2248 6 * 0.61 \u2248 3.67\n     - Gained Brick: 2 * (26/14) \u2248 2 * 1.857 \u2248 3.714\n     - Net: +0.044 (slightly positive)\n\n2. **Player 1's Offer 1**: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\n   - This is equivalent to 1 Sheep, 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick\n   - Evaluating from my perspective:\n     - Give 1 Sheep: value \u2248 2.4\n     - Give 2 Ore: value \u2248 3.142\n     - Total given: \u2248 5.542\n     - Receive 5 Brick: value \u2248 9.285\n     - Net: +3.743 (but I denied this, which might be a mistake)\n\n3. **Player 1's Offer 2**: 6 Wood, 5 Wheat \u2192 3 Brick\n   - Current me:\n     - Wood: 12 (after first trade), value per unit \u2248 11/18 \u2248 0.61 \u2192 12 * 0.61 \u2248 7.33\n     - Wheat: 5 \u2192 5 * 1 = 5\n     - Brick: 16 \u2192 26 + 3.714 \u2248 29.714 (after adding 2 from first trade)\n   - Giving 6 Wood: \u2248 3.67 value\n   - Giving 5 Wheat: 5 value\n   - Total given: \u2248 8.67\n   - Receive 3 Brick: 3 * (29.714/16) \u2248 5.571\n   - Net: 5.571 - 8.67 \u2248 -3.1 (losing trade)\n\n### Current Situation After Trades\nAfter accepting my initial 6 Wood for 2 Brick trade:\n- Wood: 18 - 6 = 12\n- Brick: 14 + 2 = 16\n- Others unchanged:\n  - Wheat: 5\n  - Sheep: 5\n  - Ore: 21\n**Current total value:**\n5 (Wheat) + (11 * (12/18)) + 12 (Sheep) + (26 * (16/14)) + 33 \u2248\n5 + 7.33 + 12 + 29.714 + 33 \u2248 87.044 (slightly up from initial 87)\n\n### Goal\nMaximize total value. Each trade should ideally increase my total value.\n\n### Player 1's Latest Offer Evaluation\nPlayer 1 just offered: 6 Wood, 5 Wheat \u2192 3 Brick\n- I have:\n  - Wood: 12 \u2192 giving 6 leaves 6\n  - Wheat: 5 \u2192 giving 5 leaves 0\n- Receive 3 Brick: now 16 + 3 = 19 Brick\n- Value analysis:\n  - Give:\n    - Wood: 6 \u2192 6 * (current Wood value) = 6 * (current Wood total value / 12) = ... seems circular. Maybe better to stick with initial per-unit values since value scales with quantity? Not sure. The value seems to be total value listed (11 for 18 Wood), so 6 Wood is 6 * (11/18) \u2248 3.67\n    - Wheat: 5 \u2192 5 * (5/5) = 5\n    - Total given: 8.67\n  - Receive: 3 Brick \u2192 3 * (26/14) \u2248 5.57\n  - Net: 5.57 - 8.67 \u2248 -3.1 (clear loss)\n\nThis is undeniably a bad trade for me. I should reject it.\n\n### What Should I Do Next?\nI need to make an offer that increases my value. Let me see what I have:\n\nCurrent resources:\n- Wheat: 5 (value 5)\n- Wood: 12 (value 11)\n- Sheep: 5 (value 12)\n- Brick: 16 (value 26)\n- Ore: 21 (value 33)\n\nLooking for trades where I give lower value-per-unit resources for higher value-per-unit ones.\n\nValue per unit (based on initial info):\n- Wheat: 1\n- Wood: 11/18 \u2248 0.61\n- Sheep: 12/5 = 2.4\n- Brick: 26/14 \u2248 1.857\n- Ore: 33/21 \u2248 1.571\n\nThus:\n- Wood and Wheat are low value\n- Sheep is highest, then Brick, then Ore\n\nI want to give Wood/Wheat for Brick/Ore. But Brick is already high for me (16), Ore is also substantial (21).\n\nAlternative: Maybe give some Ore for Brick? But Brick (1.857) > Ore (1.571), so that's value loss. Better to avoid.\n\nBetter to give Wood/Wheat for Brick/Ore. Since Brick is high, maybe Ore.\n\nPotential offer: Give some Wood for Ore.\n\nFor example:\n- 5 Wood \u2192 1 Ore\n  - Give: 5 * (11/12) \u2248 4.58 (but initial was 11/18 \u2248 0.61 per unit, so 5 * 0.61 \u2248 3.05)\n  - Receive: 1 * (33/21) \u2248 1.571\n  - Net: 1.571 - 3.05 \u2248 -1.48 (bad)\n\nActually, initial ratios might be better. Using initial per-unit:\n- 5 Wood \u2192 5 * (11/18) \u2248 3.055\n- 1 Ore \u2192 33/21 \u2248 1.571 \u2192 still bad\n\nThis shows that per initial value, Ore is actually lower than Wood per unit (1.571 vs 0.61), but totals matter. Maybe need asymmetric trades.\n\nPerhaps give high qty of low-value for small qty of higher-value.\n\nAlternative: Give Sheep (high value) for Brick, but Brick has slightly higher per-unit, so net loss.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the values are absolute totals, not per-unit. Re-reading: \"Value: 5\" next to Wheat Qty 5, so total value is 5. Thus per-unit is 1.\n\nThus to increase total value, I should trade in a way that the total value of what I receive is more than what I give, based on the absolute values listed.\n\n**This changes everything. Values are absolute totals, not per-unit. So:**\n\nCurrent totals:\n- Wheat: 5 total value (5 units)\n- Wood: 11 total value (18 units)\n- Sheep: 12 total value (5 units)\n- Brick: 26 total value (14 units)\n- Ore: 33 total value (21 units)\n\nThus value per unit:\n- Wheat: 5 / 5 = 1\n- Wood: 11 / 18 \u2248 0.61\n- Sheep: 12 / 5 = 2.4\n- Brick: 26 / 14 \u2248 1.857\n- Ore: 33 / 21 \u2248 1.571\n\nNow evaluating trades based on total value given vs received.\n\n**First trade I made**: 6 Wood \u2192 2 Brick\n- 6 Wood is part of 18, total value 11 \u2192 so Wood per unit value = 11/18\n  - 6 Wood: 6 * (11/18) = 11/3 \u2248 3.666\n- 2 Brick is part of 14, total value 26 \u2192 Brick per unit = 26/14\n  - 2 Brick: 2 * (26/14) = 52/14 \u2248 3.714\n- Net: \u2248 3.714 - 3.666 = +0.048 (minimal gain, but positive)\n\n**Now for a new offer**:\n\nI want to maximize value increase. Thus:\n\n- Give low value per unit resources (Wood, Wheat)\n- Receive high value per unit resources (Brick, Sheep)\n\nBut Sheep is extremely high (2.4), Brick next (1.857), then Ore (1.571), Wheat (1), Wood (0.61).\n\nBest trade would be give Wood for Sheep, but unlikely opponent will give Sheep cheap.\n\nNext best: give Wood for Brick.\n\nFor example, 10 Wood \u2192 5 Brick:\n- 10 Wood: 10 * (11/18) \u2248 6.111\n- 5 Brick: 5 * (26/14) \u2248 9.285\n- Net: +3.174\n\nCheck my Wood remaining after this:\nAfter first trade: 12 Wood left.\nAfter 10 Wood more: 2 Wood left, Brick would be 16 + 5 = 21.\n\nThis seems beneficial. Make this offer?\n\nAlternatively, 8 Wood \u2192 4 Brick:\n- 8 * 11/18 \u2248 4.888\n- 4 * 26/14 \u2248 7.428\n- Net: +2.54\n\n8 Wood leaving 4 Wood seems safer than 10 leaving 2.\n\nI think 8 Wood for 4 Brick is better to avoid being too Wood-scarce.\n\n### Final Decision\nI will propose: 8 Wood for 4 Brick.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wood -> 4 Brick]",

I probably **should not trade away any more Wood** unless I get disproportionate returns.\n\n### Analyze Player 1\u2019s Offers\nPlayer 1 has been offering:\n1. **Earlier**: 3 Sheep + 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 2 Sheep  \n   Net: Player 1 gives +3 Sheep \u20132 Ore \u20135 Brick \u20130 Sheep (-2 Ore \u20132 Brick effectively for me).  \n   Value for me: -2*33 -2*26 = -66 -52 = **-118**, so rejecting was correct.\n2. **Later**: 6 Wood + 5 Wheat \u2192 3 Brick  \n   Net for me: +6 Wood +5 Wheat \u20133 Brick  \n   Value: 6*11 +5*5 -3*26 = 66 +25 -78 = **+13**, but **I value Brick highly**, and 3 Brick (78) for just 13 gain is not great.  \n   Also, I just traded **away Wood** and now have **only 4 left**\u2014this would give me back 6, making new Wood count 10. But it\u2019s marginal (only 13 value gain), and I\u2019d rather use my high-value resources in future trades.\n\nPlayer 1 **desperately wants Brick** (offered Wood/Wheat for Brick), and has declined all my trades **unless I give Brick**\u2014but I just gained Brick, so I can now potentially **trade Brick sparingly for high-value gains**.\n\n### Next Move Reasoning\nI currently have:\n- **30 Wood equivalent value in Brick** (20 Brick \u00d726 = 520), which is half my resources. I could trade Brick for Wood to re-stock Wood, but **Wood is low value** (11 vs 26), so that\u2019s inefficient.\n\nConversely, **Player 1 seems resource-starved on Brick**, has low value offers (Wood/Wheat for Brick), and I have high **Ore (33)** and **Sheep (12)** to potentially trade.\n\n**High-value for me**: Ore (33) is abundant (21), but I may not want to lose it unless the exchange is very favorable.\n\n**Low-value for me**: None left to spare (Wood now scarce), and Brick is high-value area.\n\n**Possible Option**: Offer small Brick for better resources (Ore?), but Ore is what I already have.\n\nInstead, I might:\n- Offer **Ore** (33) for **Brick** (26) **ONLY IF I gain value** (unlikely).  \n- OR, accept I currently have **too much Brick**, and see if I can turn small amounts into **Ore**/**Sheep** to **rebalance**.\n\nBut Brick is highest value, so trading Brick away for less-value is bad.\n\n**Correct direction**: I lack **Wood** (4 only), and Player 1 seems to have **Wood to spare**. I should acquire **Wood** cheaply by leveraging my high-value resources.\n\n**Best play**: Offer to **buy Wood at a discount** using my **abundant Ore or Sheep**\u2014but I must ensure value gain.\n\n- **Offer**: 2 Ore (66 value) \u2192 6 Wood (66 value) \u2192 break-even, no gain.\n- **Or**: 2 Ore for 7 Wood (77 value) \u2192 gains +11. Test if Player 1 accepts.\n\nHowever, Player 1 might counter.\n\nAlternatively, **trade Sheep (12) for Wood**: 2 Sheep (24) \u2192 3 Wood (33) gains +9.\n\n### Final Decision\nI\u2019ll make a **marginal-value offer to re-stock Wood**:\n\n**[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 7 Wood]** (Value for me: -2*12 -33 +7*11 = -24 -33 +77 = **+20 net value**, plus I rebalance Wood stock.)",

      "response": "My current resources are:\n* Wheat: 23 (Value: 5)\n* Wood: 21 (Value: 10)\n* Sheep: 17 (Value: 13)\n* Brick: 21 (Value: 29)\n* Ore: 18 (Value: 35)\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I want to trade away resources with lower individual value for resources with higher individual value, or trade resources I have in abundance for resources I need more of (even if the per-unit value is similar, if the trade allows me to consolidate or get closer to a \"set\" of resources).\n\nLet's analyze the incoming offer: Player 0 is offering 2 Sheep (Value: 13 each) and 1 Ore (Value: 35). In return, they want 7 Wood (Value: 10 each).\n\nValue of offered items: (2 * 13) + (1 * 35) = 26 + 35 = 61\nValue of requested items: (7 * 10) = 70\n\nFrom a pure value perspective, I would be losing 9 value (61 - 70 = -9).\n\nHowever, I have a good quantity of Wood (21). While Wood isn't my lowest value item, it's not and extremely high value item either. I have a decent amount of Sheep and Ore, and these are higher value items.\n\nConsidering previous trades:\n* I accepted 6 Wood -> 2 Brick (Value: 60 -> 58, slight loss but I got Brick which is good)\n* I offered 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep (Value: 3*13 + 2*35 = 39+70=109 -> 5*29 + 2*13 = 145+26=171. This was a very good offer for me, but P0 rejected it).\n* I offered 6 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 3 Brick (Value: 6*10 + 5*5 = 60+25=85 -> 3*29=87. A fair offer. Rejected.)\n* I accepted 8 Wood -> 4 Brick (Value: 80 -> 116. A very good offer for me.)\n\nPlayer 0 has been making offers that are sometimes favorable to me. This current offer, on its face, is slightly negative for me. But let's consider the item types.\nI am trading away Wood, which I have a decent stock of (21). I am receiving Sheep and Ore, which are higher value items per unit.\nGiving up 7 Wood would leave me with 14 Wood.\nGaining 2 Sheep would bring me to 19 Sheep.\nGaining 1 Ore would bring me to 19 Ore.\n\nWhile the raw value calculation is negative, receiving higher value items and reducing a mid-value abundant resource might be strategically good if I can then use those higher value items for better trades later. However, a loss is still a loss.\n\nGiven my goal is to *increase* the total value of my resources, accepting a trade that *decreases* my total value, even slightly, is counter to my primary objective unless there's a strong strategic reason. In this case, while getting higher value items is good, giving up disproportionately more value for them is not optimal.\n\nI have 23 Wheat, 21 Wood, 17 Sheep, 21 Brick, 18 Ore.\nI have a significant amount of Wood and Wheat. Brick and Ore are high value, and I have a good amount of them. Sheep is mid-high value.\n\nI will reject this offer, as it results in a net loss of value for me. I would prefer to trade my lower value items (Wood, Wheat) for higher value items (Brick, Ore, maybe Sheep) at a more favorable rate, or at least a neutral rate.\nI don't have a new offer in mind immediately that is significantly different from my previous rejected offers. I'll pass on this turn and see what Player 0 offers next, or formulate a new offer for myself.\n[Deny]",

Objective  \n   Every resource for me produces the following marginal value:  \n   Wheat 1, Wood 0.7, Sheep 2.4, Brick 1.9, Ore 1.6  \n   I want trades where the weighted value I give away is less than the weighted value I receive:  \n        \u03a3(quantity_i \u00b7 value_i) given < \u03a3(quantity_j \u00b7 value_j) received.\n\n3. Identification of surplus/deficit  \n   - Brick and Ore are still very strong for me.  \n   - Wood is now extremely low and losing marginal value rapidly.  \n   - Sheep remains identical; I have little incentive to trade it away if the return is low.  \n\n4. Potential beneficial trade options  \n   I have 20 Brick.  Trading away \u22644 Brick is acceptable because the marginal value only rises after 20 Brick, so impact is light.  \n   I desperately need Wood (quickly rising marginal value after falling under 5 units).\n\n   Let\u2019s look at 3 Brick \u2192 2 Wood.\n\n   Value I give: 3\u00b71.9 = 5.7  \n   Value I receive: 2\u00b7(currently Wood value at 4\u21925 units is 2.5+) \u2248 2\u00b73.3 (conservative) \u22486.6  \u279c Net benefit ~+0.9, plus keeps Wood above critical 5-unit threshold.\n\n5. Anticipating Player 1  \n   P1 gave big packages (11 resources for 3 Brick) which I adamantly refused.  \n   An offer of just 3 Brick for 2 Wood is modest and has a realistic chance of being accepted, especially since P1 has repeatedly sought Brick and still holds Wood.\n\nDecision  \n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Wood]",

Yes, this one does significantly.\n2.  **Resource type:** Am I trading away lower-value resources for higher-value ones? Yes, Wood (10) for Brick (29).\n3.  **Quantity:** How many units of each resource are involved? Small quantities of high-value items versus low-value items are preferred.\n\nOpponent's perspective:\nPlayer 0 seems to be in need of Wood. They have consistently offered to trade Brick for Wood or Wood for Brick, but always with a disadvantage to themselves in terms of value. My previous acceptances also provided them with Wood. This current offer is extremely favorable to me, which suggests Player 0 might have an abundance of Brick or a critical need for Wood.\n\nPrevious interactions:\n- I accepted 6 Wood -> 2 Brick (P0 offered, P1 gave Wood, got Brick). Value: -60 + 58 = -2. (Bad for me, P0 needs Wood).\n- I offered 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep (P0 rejected).\n- I offered 6 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 3 Brick (P0 rejected). (I tried to trade low value for high value, P0 didn't accept).\n- I accepted 8 Wood -> 4 Brick (P0 offered, P1 gave Wood, got Brick). Value: -80 + 116 = +36. (Good for me, P0 needs Wood).\n- P0 offered 2 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 7 Wood (I rejected). Value: +26 + 35 - 70 = -9. (Bad for me, I give high value for low value).\n\nCurrent offer is 3 Brick -> 2 Wood from Player 0.
