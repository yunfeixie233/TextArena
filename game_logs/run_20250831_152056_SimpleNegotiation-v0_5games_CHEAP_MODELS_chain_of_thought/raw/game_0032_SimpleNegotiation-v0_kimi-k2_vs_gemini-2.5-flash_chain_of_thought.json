      "response": "Alright, let's break this down methodically.\n\n### 1. Current Portfolio Analysis:\n- **Total value**: (18\u00d76) + (17\u00d711) + (17\u00d715) + (11\u00d729) + (23\u00d736) = 108 + 187 + 255 + 319 + 828 = **1,697**\n- **Highest-value resources**: Ore (36), Brick (29)\n- **Lowest-value resources**: Wheat (6), Wood (11)\n\n### 2. Strategic Goals:\n- **Maximize overall value** by trading low-value resources for high-value ones.\n- **Prioritize acquiring Ore (36) and Brick (29)**, as they yield the highest marginal gain.  \n- **Consider liquidity**: While Sheep (15) is mid-tier, it's abundant (17), so we can spare some for high-value trades.  \n- **Minimize giving up Brick/Ore** unless we\u2019re getting an unrealistically good return (which is unlikely).\n\n### 3. AI-Opponent Modeling:\n- The opponent will likely mirror our efforts: trying to give low-value resources (Wheat/Wood) to us in exchange for Sheep/Ore.  \n- **Avoid falling into traps** where we trade high-value for low-value.\n\n### 4. Trade Evaluation:\nWe want trades where:  \n\u2192 **We give low-value and receive high-value.**  \nHere\u2019s a possible offer:  \n- **Give**: 2 Sheep (30 total value) + 3 Wheat (18) = 48  \n- **Get**: 3 Brick (87)  \nNet gain: +39 to us, -39 to opponent. This is lopsided *against* the opponent, so they\u2019ll likely deny.  \n\n**Adjustment**: Make the trade slightly worse for us but still profitable.  \n- **New Offer**: Offer 5 Sheep (75) + 2 Wood (22) \u2192 5 Brick (145) + 2 Sheep (30)  \n  - Net for us: (-75 -22 +145 +30) = +78  \n  - Net for them: -78  \n  Still too greedy.  \n\n**More realistic**:  \n- **Offer**: 3 Sheep (45) + 2 Ore (72) \u2192 5 Brick (145) + 2 Wheat (12)  \n  - Net for us: (-45 -72 +145 +12) = +40  \n  - Net for them: -40  \n  Still asymmetric.  \n\n**Balanced but favorable**:  \n- **Offer**: 3 Sheep (45) \u2192 2 Brick (58) + 1 Wheat (6)  \n  - Net for us: -45 +64 = +19  \n  - Net for them: -19  \n  This might be acceptable.  \n\n### 5. Refined Offer:\nTo maximize value while making it plausible, target Brick (highest after Ore).  \n\n**Final Offer**:  \n- **Give**: 3 Sheep (45 value)  \n- **Get**: 2 Brick (58 value) + 1 Wood (11 value)  \n  - Net: +24 to us (-45 +58 +11].  \n  - Feels fairer: opponent gives up 2 Brick (scarce) but gets mid-tier Sheep.  \n\nHowever, since Brick is scarce (only 11 qty), opponent may hesitate. Let\u2019s go for Ore instead:  \n\n- **Offer**: 4 Sheep (60) + 2 Wheat (12) \u2192 2 Ore (72) + 1 Brick (29)  \n  - Net: -60 -12 +72 +29 = +29 to us (-29 to them).  \n\n### Decision:\nThe last offer is **strong (+29)** and targets Ore.  \n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]",

This means I want to trade away resources that are less valuable to me for resources that are more valuable.\n\nPlayer 0 has offered:\n*   Offered items (from Player 0 to me): 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat\n    *   Value of offered items: (4 * 17) + (2 * 5) = 68 + 10 = 78\n*   Requested items (from me to Player 0): 2 Ore, 1 Brick\n    *   Value of requested items: (2 * 40) + (1 * 25) = 80 + 25 = 105\n\nIf I accept this trade:\n*   I gain 4 Sheep (value 68) and 2 Wheat (value 10).\n*   I lose 2 Ore (value 80) and 1 Brick (value 25).\n*   Net change in value for me: (68 + 10) - (80 + 25) = 78 - 105 = -27.\n\nThis trade would decrease my total value by 27. Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\nI need to make a counter-offer that increases my total value. I have a lot of Wheat and Ore. Ore is my most valuable resource, and Wheat is my least valuable. I also have a decent amount of Sheep. I have the fewest Brick.\n\nPlayer 0 asked for Ore and Brick, which are valuable to me (Brick particularly because I have fewer). They offered Sheep and Wheat, which are less valuable to me overall.\n\nI want to trade away less valuable items (like Wheat or perhaps some Sheep or Wood) for more valuable items (like Brick or Ore, or even Sheep/Wood if the ratio is very favorable).\n\nLet's consider what Player 0 might need. They are asking for Ore and Brick, suggesting they might be trying to build something that requires these high-value resources. They are offering Sheep and Wheat, which could mean they have an abundance of these or value them less.\n\nI have a large quantity of Wheat and Ore. I also have plenty of Sheep. My Brick quantity is relatively low.\nI would like to acquire more Brick and keep my Ore.\n\nLet's try to offer a resource I have in abundance and find less valuable (like Wheat or Sheep) in exchange for something more valuable to me, like Brick or Ore.\n\nSince Player 0 is *asking* for Ore and Brick, they clearly have a need for them. I might be able to get a better deal for them. However, giving up Ore and Brick is detrimental to my value.\n\nLet's build an offer that improves my position.\nI have 23 Wheat (value 5) and 22 Sheep (value 17).\nI need Brick (value 25) and perhaps more Wood (value 10), or even more Ore if the ratio is good.\n\nLet's try to get some Brick.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of low-value resources for a smaller quantity of high-value resources?\n\nConsider offering Wheat and/or Sheep for Brick or Ore.\nPlayer 0 offered Sheep and Wheat. This might indicate they have plenty of it. However, they also *asked* for Ore and Brick, suggesting they value those highly.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick. I currently have only 8.\n\nHow about: I offer some Sheep and Wheat, and ask for Brick?\nOffer: 5 Sheep (5 * 17 = 85) + 5 Wheat (5 * 5 = 25) = 110\nRequest: 3 Brick (3 * 25 = 75) + 1 Ore (1 * 40 = 40) = 115\nThis is a small gain for me (+5), but I'm giving up a lot of items.\n\nWhat if I try to get some of the resources Player 0 offered, but at a better rate, while giving up something I have in high quantity?\nThe initial offer involved giving up precious Ore and Brick for less valuable Sheep and Wheat. I want the opposite.\n\nLet's try to trade some of my excess Wheat and Sheep for something more valuable.\nI have 23 Wheat and 22 Sheep.\nI only have 8 Brick. Brick is very valuable to me.\n\nPerhaps a straightforward value exchange that slightly favors me.\nI want Brick or Ore. Player 0 wanted Ore and Brick. This is a common interest!\nBut P0's offer was bad for me. I need to make an offer that is good *for me*.\n\nLet's try to offer a combination of lower-value goods for higher-value goods.\nI have a ton of Wheat (qty 23), it's my lowest value item.\nI have a ton of Ore (qty 24), it's my highest value item.\n\nI will try to trade away some Wheat and Sheep for Brick.\nOffer: 10 Wheat (50) + 5 Sheep (85) = 135 value\nRequest: 4 Brick (100) + 1 Wood (10) + 1 Ore (40) = 150 value\nThis is a gain of 15 for me. It's a significant amount of Wheat, but I have a lot.\n\nAnother option: trade some Ore for Brick, but at a favorable rate for me.\nOffer: 1 Ore (40)\nRequest: 2 Brick (50)\nThis is a gain of 10 for me. I'm trading my most valuable resource for my second most valuable, at a good rate. This might be plausible since P0 asked for Ore.\n\nLet's consider Player 0's initial request again: 2 Ore, 1 Brick. This suggests they value these resources highly. If I offer some Ore and request a lot of Brick, it might be accepted if they have excess Brick. But they requested Brick, so maybe they *don't* have excess.\n\nLet's try to get some of the exact items they requested from me, but for a much better return for myself.\nThey offered: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat (total 78 value)\nThey requested: 2 Ore, 1 Brick (total 105 value) - Their proposal was to gain 27 value.\n\nMy counter-proposal needs to be something that:\n1.  Increases my total value.\n2.  Might be appealing to Player 0.\n\nPerhaps I can offer some Ore (which they seem to want) for an overpay in Brick (which I want), or a combination of Sheep and Wheat.\n\nLet's try to gain Brick. I only have 8.\nOffer: 8 Sheep (8 * 17 = 136)\nRequest: 5 Brick (5 * 25 = 125)\nThis is a loss of 11 for me. Not good.\n\nOffer: 10 Wheat (10 * 5 = 50) + 3 Sheep (3 * 17 = 51) = 101\nRequest: 4 Brick (4 * 25 = 100)\nThis is a loss of 1 for me. Also not good.\n\nI need to make a clear value gain.\n\nWhat if I offer a lot of Wheat and some Wood (my lowest and second lowest valued item in quantity) for Brick?\nOffer: 15 Wheat (15 * 5 = 75) + 5 Wood (5 * 10 = 50) = 125\nRequest: 5 Brick (5 * 25 = 125) + 1 Sheep (1 * 17 = 17) = 142\nThis would give me a gain of 17. It uses up a lot of my low-value resources and gives me much-needed Brick. It also adds a Sheep, which P0 seems to have. This seems like a reasonable offer that benefits me and might appeal to P0 (they get a lot of common resources).\n\nAlternative: Since Player 0 is asking for Ore, I can leverage my large supply of Ore.\nOffer: 1 Ore (value 40)\nRequest: 2 Brick (value 50)\nThis gains me 10 value. It's concise and clearly beneficial. I reduce my Ore, but gain Brick, which is also valuable and I have less of.\n\nLet's calculate the quantities after this trade:\nCurrent: Ore 24, Brick 8\nIf accepted: Ore 23, Brick 10\n\nThis seems like a solid offer because:\n1. It benefits me (gain +10 value).\n2. Player 0 asked for Ore, so they might be inclined to get it.\n3. I am asking for Brick, which is a high-value resource they might have spare (though they also requested it, which is odd, unless it's a \"build specific item\" need).\n\nI will try this one.\n\nStep-by-step thinking for the chosen offer:\n1.  **Analyze current resources and values:** I have plenty of Wheat, Ore, and Sheep. I have less Brick and Wood. Ore is my most valuable resource per unit, Wheat is least valuable.\n2.  **Goal:** Increase total resource value.\n3.  **Analyze Player 0's offer:** P0's offer was a net loss of 27 value for me. Deny automatically.\n4.  **Consider Player 0's needs/wants:** P0 offered Sheep and Wheat, wanted Ore and Brick. This suggests they need high-value resources (Ore, Brick) and may have excess low-value resources (Sheep, Wheat).\n5.  **Formulate counter-offer strategy:** I want to trade low-value for high-value OR trade high-value for even higher-value at a good ratio. Since P0 wants Ore, I can potentially leverage my abundant Ore for something I value. I need more Brick.\n6.  **Develop specific offer:** Offer 1 Ore (value 40) for 2 Brick (value 50).\n7.  **Calculate value change:** Gain 50 (Brick) - Lose 40 (Ore) = Net gain of 10.\n8.  **Assess offer appeal to Player 0:** Player 0 explicitly asked for Ore. This offer provides them with Ore. If they have spare Brick, or value Ore more than 2 Brick in their current strategy, this could be appealing to them. It's a simple, clear trade. Also, they asked for *1* Brick, so if they have 2 available, it might fit their needs.\n\nThis feels like a strong, concise offer that directly addresses part of what Player 0 requested while significantly benefiting me.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]",

This means I want to trade away resources that are less valuable to me (or that I have in abundance) for resources that are more valuable.\n\nLet's evaluate the previous interactions:\n- Player 0 offered: 4 Sheep (Value 17*4=68), 2 Wheat (Value 5*2=10) -> Requested: 2 Ore (Value 40*2=80), 1 Brick (Value 25*1=25).\n  - My perspective: Offered me 78 value for 105 value. This was a bad trade for me, so rejecting was correct.\n- I offered: 1 Ore (Value 40) -> Requested: 2 Brick (Value 25*2=50).\n  - My perspective: I offered 40 value for 50 value. This was a good trade for me. Player 0 rejected it, which implies they didn't see it as beneficial for them. This indicates Player 0 values Brick highly, or does not want to give up 2 Brick for 1 Ore.\n\nConsider Player 0's potential needs/holdings:\n- Their previous offer suggests they might be short on Ore and Brick, or they value them highly.\n- They were willing to give up Sheep and Wheat, suggesting they might have an abundance of these or value them less.\n\nMy current resource quantities: I have a good amount of Wheat (23), Sheep (22), and Ore (24). I have fewer Brick (8) and Wood (15).\nFrom a value perspective, Wood (10) and Wheat (5) are my lowest value per unit resources. Ore (40) and Brick (25) are my highest value per unit resources. Sheep (17) is in the middle.\n\nStrategy for this turn:\n1.  **Analyze Player 0's last move**: They rejected my reasonable offer of 1 Ore for 2 Brick and made no new offer. This could mean they are waiting for me to make another offer or they are trying to understand my valuation. It also confirms my suspicion that Brick is valuable to them or they don't want to give up 2 units of it easily.\n2.  **Evaluate my position**: I still have plenty of Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. I'm low on Brick and Wood. My previous offer was to gain Brick, which is a good High-Value resource.\n3.  **Formulate a new offer**:\n    *   I want to gain high-value resources (Brick, Ore) for lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) or trade high-value for even higher value (e.g., Ore for more Brick value).\n    *   Since Player 0 rejected 1 Ore for 2 Brick, giving them 40 value for 50 value, I might need to make an offer that is more appealing to them, or try a different resource.\n    *   I have a lot of Ore. Player 0 wanted Ore in their first offer. Perhaps I can offer Ore again, but ask for something else or a slightly adjusted ratio.\n    *   Let's try to get Brick again, as it's a good value resource I'm low on.\n    *   Instead of offering Ore for Brick, which they seemed to reject at that ratio, what if I offer something they might value less (Sheep/Wheat) for Brick? Their first offer suggests they have Sheep/Wheat.\n    *   Let's consider an offer where I get more value than I give.\n        *   Option A: Offer resources I have in abundance and are lower value (Wheat, Sheep) for higher value resources (Brick, Ore).\n        *   Option B: Offer a slightly different Ore-for-Brick ratio. Player 0 didn't like 1 Ore (40) for 2 Brick (50). Maybe they want more Ore, or less Brick?\n        *   Option C: Target Wood. I'm low on Wood, too. But its value is lower (10).\n\nPlayer 0's previous lack of initiative and rejection of my beneficial offer suggests they might be cautious or have different valuations.\nI have 24 Ore. I can afford to trade some.\nLet's try to get Brick. I have 8 Brick and value them.\nIf I offer 1 Ore (40) for 1 Brick (25), that's bad for me.\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (34) for 1 Brick (25), that's bad for me (giving 34 for 25).\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (15) for 1 Brick (25), that's good for me. Would Player 0 accept? Probably not if they need Brick.\n\nLet's reconsider the previous trade rejection from Player 0. My offer was 1 Ore (40) for 2 Brick (50). This was +10 value for me. Maybe Player 0 thinks Brick is worth more than 25, or they simply have too few to give up 2.\nWhat if I offer a resource that is less \"valuable\" to me, for a resource that is more \"valuable\" to me or I'm short on?\n\nI have a lot of Sheep and Wheat. Player 0 seemed to have them.\nI want Brick or Ore. Player 0 seemed to want Ore and give up Sheep/Wheat.\n\nPerhaps Player 0 values Sheep or Wheat more than their base value, or just has an abundance and wants to diversify.\nLet's try to gain Brick, as it's relatively high value and I have few.\nWhat if I offer something that seems like a good deal *for them* but is still good for me?\nOffer: 2 Wheat (10) + 1 Sheep (17) = 27 value.\nRequest: 1 Brick (25).\nThis is me giving 27 value for 25 value. That's a -2 value trade for me. I should avoid this.\n\nI need to make a positive value trade.\nLet's look at the highest value resources first.\nOre (40), Brick (25), Sheep (17), Wood (10), Wheat (5).\n\nIf I give up low-value items for high-value items, that's ideal.\nExample: Give Wheat (5) or Wood (10) for Brick (25) or Ore (40).\nCan I offer a lot of Wheat for 1 Brick? 5 Wheat (25) for 1 Brick (25) would be a 0 value trade. 6 Wheat (30) for 1 Brick (25) would be -5.\nThis means I need to offer few low-value items or a reasonable number of middle-value items.\n\nConsider trading away Ore again, but not for Brick directly, but maybe for Wood (which I'm also low on and could be useful for other interactions) and something else.\nPlayer 0 seemed to want Ore.\nOffer: 1 Ore (40)\nRequest: 3 Wood (30) + 1 Sheep (17)? Total 47 for 40. This is good for me, but maybe too good.\nOr, 1 Ore (40) for 2 Wood (20) + 1 Brick (25)? Total 45 for 40. This is good for me.\n\nLet's refine the 1 Ore for 2 Brick rejection. Player 0 might have thought 2 Brick (50) for 1 Ore (40) was too much for them to *give*.\nMaybe Player 0 wants a more balanced trade.\n\nWhat if I aim for a trade that gives me a high value item I'm low on, using something I have in abundance?\nI have 22 Sheep. Value 17.\nI have 23 Wheat. Value 5.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick.\nMaybe Player 0 values Sheep less than me, or has a lot.\nOffer: 3 Sheep (3 * 17 = 51)\nRequest: 2 Brick (2 * 25 = 50)\nThis is me giving 51 value for 50 value. Almost a 0 sum trade, which is not ideal for me as I want to increase total value.\n\nI must make a positive value trade.\nWhat if I give a high quantity of low-value resources for a low quantity of high-value resources?\nI have 23 Wheat (Value 5).\nIf I offer 5 Wheat (25) for 1 Brick (25), that's neutral.\nIf I offer 4 Wheat (20) for 1 Brick (25), that's good for me (+5 value). Player 0 might reject this though, if they need Brick.\n\nLet's try to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me and potentially acceptable for Player 0 if they value certain resources differently or want to diversify.\nTargeting Brick is good, as I'm low on it and it's high value.\n\nMy offer for Player 0:\nI have a lot of Ore. Player 0 previously wanted Ore.\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore (40) for 1 Brick (25) + 1 Wood (10) + 1 Wheat (5)?\nTotal asked: 25 + 10 + 5 = 40. This is a neutral trade for me. Not a good one.\n\nI need to gain value.\nPrevious analysis: Player 0 offered 4 Sheep (68), 2 Wheat (10) [Total 78] for 2 Ore (80), 1 Brick (25) [Total 105].\nThey offered me 78 value for 105 value. This was bad for me.\nMy offer: 1 Ore (40) for 2 Brick (50). Good for me (+10 value).\n\nMaybe I need to be less greedy, or find a sweet spot.\nLet's try to divest some Sheep or Wheat.\nI have 22 Sheep. Value 17.\nI have 23 Wheat. Value 5.\n\nIf I offer Wheat, I'd have to offer a lot for a good resource.\nSay, 5 Wheat (25) for 1 Brick (25). Neutral.\n1 Ore (40) -> What can I ask for that gives me more than 40 value and they might accept?\nLet's consider getting Wood, as I have limited supply.\n1 Ore (40) for 4 Wood (40). Neutral.\n1 Ore (40) for 5 Wood (50)? Good for me. Player 0 might accept if they have abundant Wood.\n\nLet's make an offer that shifts my resources from high quantity, medium/high value (Ore) to high value (Brick) or high value with lower quantity (Wood/Brick).\nMy previous offer of 1 Ore for 2 Brick was +10 value for me. They rejected. Perhaps it's the quantity of Brick, or the ratio.\n\nLet's try again with Ore as the offering resource, as I have a lot and Player 0 wanted it.\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore (40) and request 1 Brick (25) AND some lower value resources to make the trade beneficial to me?\nRequesting 1 Brick (25) + 2 Sheep (34) = 59 for 40 (My favor: +19). Player 0 would likely reject.\n\nLet's try to get Brick because it's valuable and I have few.\nWhat if I offer more popular resources or a bundle of them?\nHow about trading a lot of Wheat and Sheep, for some Brick and Wood?\nOffer: 3 Wheat (15) + 2 Sheep (34) = 49 value.\nRequest: 1 Brick (25) + 2 Wood (20) = 45 value.\nThis is 49 value for 45 value. It's a negative trade for me (-4 value), so I should not do it.\n\nI need to be positive.\nWhat about offering a resource that I have way too many of and is lower value, and asking for a higher value resource?\nI have 23 Wheat (Val 5), 22 Sheep (Val 17), 24 Ore (Val 40).\nI have 8 Brick (Val 25), 15 Wood (Val 10).\n\nLet's try to get more Brick.\nOffer 4 Sheep (4 * 17 = 68) for 2 Brick (2 * 25 = 50) + 1 Wood (10) = 60. Still a loss for me.\n\nThe simplest approach is often the best. Player 0 rejected my 1 Ore for 2 Brick offer.\nWhat if I modify that slightly to be more appealing to them, but still positive for me?\nMaybe 1 Ore (40) for 1 Brick (25) + 1 Sheep (17) = 42?\nThis is me giving 40 value and getting 42 value. This is a +2 value trade for me. Small, but positive. Player 0 gets Ore which they seem to want and gives up a less valuable Sheep and 1 Brick. This might be acceptable.\n\nLet's review the last proposed trade:\nOffer: 1 Ore (Value 40)\nRequest: 1 Brick (Value 25) + 1 Sheep (Value 17)\nMy value change: -40 + 25 + 17 = +2.\nQuantity change: -1 Ore, +1 Brick, +1 Sheep.\nThis is a small gain, but a gain nonetheless. It addresses Player 0's potential desire for Ore and my desire for Brick, while offloading a Sheep.\n\nLet's double-check the previous interaction from Player 0: they offered 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat for 2 Ore, 1 Brick. They value Ore and Brick more than Sheep and Wheat.\nMy offer of 1 Ore for 1 Brick + 1 Sheep might appeal to them. They give up less total value (1 Brick + 1 Sheep = 42) for 1 Ore (40). This is a -2 value trade for them. They explicitly rejected -10 value trade for them (my previous offer of 1 Ore for 2 Brick).\nThis offer of +2 for me and -2 for them seems like a fair middle ground, which could be accepted.\n\nMy goal is to increase my total value. This trade does that.\n\nFinal check on resources:\nCurrent: W:23, Wo:15, S:22, B:8, O:24\nIf trade goes through: O becomes 23. B becomes 9. S becomes 23.\n\nThis is a good, small positive trade for me, and looks balanced enough that Player 0 might accept it, especially since they previously initiated an offer trying to get Ore.\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]",

Rational M reject.\n\n   - Player 1\u2019s new offer: \u201c1 Ore \u2192 1 Brick + 1 Sheep\u201d  \n     \u2013 Player 1 gives 36, gets 29 + 15 = 44. That is a +8 value win for them, \u22128 value for me.\n\n3. **Assess whether accepting this latest offer is worthwhile**  \n   - It is clearly negative value (\u22128) to my total.  \n   - Goal: Increase my value, not decrease it.  \n   \u2192 Therefore I will not accept it.\n\n4. **Should I make a counter-offer now?**  \n   - I have very high Ore quantity (23) and value (36). It\u2019s powerful leverage.  \n   - My lowest-valued resource is Wheat (18, value 6); I can safely offer more of it.  \n   - My Brick stock (11) is middling; still quite high in unit value (29). I could afford to give up ~3 to 4 Brick if I get disproportionate value.\n\n5. **Designing an attractive but profitable new offer**  \n   Objective: take advantage of my Ore surplus while still gaining net value. Offer should look generous yet actually favours me.\n\n   - **Option 1**: Offer some Ore to Player 1 in exchange for lower value resources.  \n        Example: \u201c3 Ore (3\u00d736=108) but ask for 2\u00d729 Brick + 3\u00d715 Sheep = 103\u201d. Net \u22125 value to me, not worth.\n\n   - **Option 2**: Offer moderately valued resources / lower-valued resources and ask for moderate quantities of Ore.  \n        Example: \u201cGive 3 Sheep + 2 Wheat (3\u00d715+2\u00d76=57), ask 1 Ore (36) + 1 Brick (29)\u201d. Net gain +8 exactly as the opponent aimed for, but in my favour.\n\n   - **Option 3**: Offer higher quantities of my low-value Wheat (I have 18) and ask for Ore.  \n        E.g. \u201c5 Wheat (5\u00d76=30) \u2192 1 Ore (36)\u201d. Net +6 for me, looks very small so opponent may not accept (for them 5 Wheat is 30 value, loss of 6 value).\n\n   - **Option 4**: Combine the two directions: offer excess Sheep, get back Ore.  \n        \u201cGive 2 Sheep + 2 Wheat (2\u00d715+2\u00d76=42), ask 1 Ore (36)\u201d. Net \u22126 for me. Not acceptable in reverse either.\n\n6. **Pick the most balanced high-value-gain proposal**  \n   Re-use Option 2 with quantities adjusted for appearance of good return to them:\n\n   \u201c3 Sheep, 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore, 1 Brick\u201d  \n   Value given: 3\u00d715 + 2\u00d76 = 57  \n   Value received: 36 + 29 = 65  \n   Net value change: **+8 to me**.  \n   It mirrors exactly the trade they just tried (but with Sheep instead of Brick) so it looks symmetrical and bite-sized, increasing the chance they accept.\n\n   My overall resource counts after this trade:\n   - \u20132 Wheat\u2003\u2192 16  \n   - \u20133 Sheep\u2003\u2192 14  \n   - +1 Ore\u2003\u2192 24  \n   - +1 Brick\u2003\u2192 12  \n\n   The new total value = 1,697 + 8 = 1,705.\n\n7. **Output the action**\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",

Who might value what?\n   From the offers floated so far, Player 1 seems:\n   - Desperate for Brick (kept offering 1 Ore \u2013 value 36 \u2013 for 1\u20132 Brick \u2013 value 29\u201358).  \n   - Not especially keen on Sheep or Wheat (he rejected a trade that asked for Ore/Brick in exchange for Sheep/Wheat before eventually accepted a lighter version).\n\n   Therefore, my best leverage for more value is to offer Brick in return for something Player 1 doesn't mind giving up.\n\n4. Constructing a favorable offer\n   - I\u2019d be glad to give 1 Brick for 2 Wheat (since 29 \u2192 12 = +17 surplus) but that\u2019s unlikely; Wheat seems unattractive to him.  \n   - Renewing the Brick+Ore combo in exchange for more of my non-Ore resources doesn\u2019t add net value (Ore is already my most valuable).  \n   - I can spare two Brick without falling below 10, so a 2-for-1 trade (2 Brick \u2192 3 Ore) would net (108 \u2013 58) = +50 surplus value for me, which is excellent, but may feel steep for the opponent. A gentler 2 Brick \u2192 5 Sheep (75 \u2013 58 = +17) is also good, and Sheep is lower tier (15 vs 29).  \n   - Given his earlier rejection of 1 Ore for 2 Brick, we can infer his pain threshold on Brick is higher\u2014he\u2019d pay up to 36 per Brick. Hence, offering 2 Brick for 3 Ore should look reasonable to him: he still gains value if he values Brick even slightly above 24.\n\n5.

Therefore, I should reject it.\n\nNext, I need to make a counter-offer or a new offer.\nMy most valuable resource is Ore (Value 40). My least valuable is Wheat (Value 5). Brick is also quite valuable (Value 25).\nI want to trade away less valuable resources for more valuable ones, or trade away resources I have in abundance for resources I need.\nCurrently, I have a good quantity of Ore (24) and Sheep (22). My Brick quantity (8) is relatively low.\nI have accepted a trade previously where I gave up Sheep and Wheat for Ore and Brick. This implies Player 0 might be interested in Sheep and Wheat.\n\nLet's consider what Player 0 might want. They just tried to get Ore from me, suggesting they value Ore highly or have a surplus of Brick.\nI have a lot of Ore that is valuable, but I don't want to give it away cheaply.\nI have 22 Sheep and 23 Wheat. These are my lowest value items. I could try to trade these for something more valuable like Brick or Ore.\n\nA previous successful trade involved me giving up 3 Sheep and 2 Wheat (3*17 + 2*5 = 51 + 10 = 61) for 1 Ore and 1 Brick (40 + 25 = 65). This was a good trade.\n\nLet's try to get Brick or Ore from Player 0, offering Sheep and/or Wheat.\nHow about offering a good amount of Sheep and Wheat for a single higher value item like Brick or Ore?\n\nOption 1: Offer Sheep/Wheat for Brick\nI have 22 Sheep (value 17). 3 Sheep = 51. Maybe 3 Sheep for 2 Brick? (51 vs 50). That's a very even trade, maybe too even.\nWhat about trying to get an Ore?\nLet's try to offer a similar value to my last successful trade, but target Ore or Brick.\n\nI'm looking for a positive value exchange.\nPlayer 0 just offered 2 Brick for 3 Ore (value 50 for 120). This implies they have Brick to spare and want Ore.\nI have 24 Ore, so I can afford to trade some if the return is good. However, their proposed rate for Ore is bad for me.\n\nConsider giving some Ore, but demanding a higher return of Brick.\nIf I give 1 Ore (value 40), what would I want in return?\n2 Brick (value 50) would be a good trade for me (+10 value). Player 0 just offered me 2 Brick for 3 Ore, so they might have Brick.\nPlayer 0 rejected my offer of 1 Ore for 2 Brick previously.\nPlayer 0 rejected my offer of 1 Ore for 1 Brick, 1 Sheep previously.\n\nLet's try to offload some Wheat and Sheep as they are lower value.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wheat and Sheep for a single valuable item?\nE.g., 5 Wheat (25) + 3 Sheep (51) = 76 value. For 2 Brick (50) + 1 Ore (40) = 90 value. This would be a 14 value increase.\nBut asking for 3 items might be too much.\n\nLet's try a smaller, more focused offer based on what Player 0 tried to offer (Brick for Ore).\nThey offered 2 Brick for 3 Ore.\nI want to get Ore/Brick from them.\nI might tempt them by offering some Ore, but with a highly favorable ratio to me.\n\nSince they seem to have Brick to spare, I will try to acquire Brick.\nI have 24 Ore. I could part with some. What if I offer 1 Ore (value 40) for 2 Brick (value 50)? This is a +10 value trade for me. I have tried this before and it was rejected.\nWhat if I try for 1 Ore for 1 Brick, 1 Sheep? (40 vs 25+17=42). This is a +2 value for me. I tried this and it was rejected.\n\nLet's try to gain some Brick for non-Ore/Brick items.\nI have 22 Sheep. Value 17.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (value 51) for 2 Brick (value 50)? This is very close to even. Player 0 rejected this kind of offer before.\nMaybe 4 Sheep (value 68) for 3 Brick (value 75)? This would be a +7 value. But it's a lot of Sheep.\n\nGiven Player 0's last offer was 2 Brick for 3 Ore, it indicates they have Brick and want Ore. My aim is always to increase my total value.\nTherefore, I should try to trade away lower value items for Ore/Brick, OR trade away Ore/Brick for an even better deal.\n\nI will try to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me, but might be perceived as okay by Player 0, given their apparent need for Ore.\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore (value 40) for a significant amount of Brick?\nLike 1 Ore for 3 Brick (value 75)? This is a +35 value trade for me. This is probably too aggressive.\n\nLet's go back to trading my less valuable resources.\nWheat and Sheep are my lowest value items. I have 23 Wheat and 22 Sheep.\nI could try to consolidate my lower value items into higher value items.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (value 25) + 2 Sheep (value 34) = Total 59.\nRequest: 2 Brick (value 50) + 1 Wood (10) = Total 60. (+1 value). Not very good for me.\n\nLet's rethink my strategy. Player 0 explicitly offered Brick for Ore. This is a clear signal.\nMy current total value: 1799.\nPlayer 0's offer: Give 3 Ore (120), Get 2 Brick (50). This resulted in a -70 value change for me. I must deny this.\n\nI want to acquire Brick or Ore. I'm willing to give up Sheep, Wheat, or Wood.\nWhat about offering a bundle of low-value items for 1 Brick?\nOffer: 3 Sheep (51) -> Request: 2 Brick (50). I offered 3 Sheep and rejected.\n\nGiven Player 0 values Ore, I might be able to get a *better* deal for my Ore than they offered me.\nInstead of offering 1 Ore for 2 Brick, which they initially rejected. What about if I sweeten the request?\nI could try offering 2 Sheep (value 34) and 2 Wheat (value 10) for 1 Brick (value 25) and 1 Ore (value 40).\nValue out: 44. Value in: 65. (+21 value for me). This is a great deal for me.\nThe items offered (Sheep and Wheat) are plentiful for me, and I gain highly valuable Ore and Brick. This might be tempting enough for Player 0 if they truly want Sheep and Wheat, and have spare Brick and Ore.\n\nLet's evaluate the offer from Player 0 (2 Brick for 3 Ore):\nValue offered: 3 * 40 = 120\nValue received: 2 * 25 = 50\nDeny.\n\nNow, my offer.\nI want to increase my valuable items (Brick, Ore). I want to decrease my less valuable items (Wheat, Sheep, Wood).\nI have a significant amount of Sheep and Wheat.\nPlayer 0 just offered Brick for my Ore, which suggests they have surplus Brick.\nSo I will target Brick.\nWhat about offering Shepherd and Wheat for Brick?\nOffer: 4 Sheep (value 68), 3 Wheat (value 15) = 83 value.\nRequest: 3 Brick (value 75), 1 Ore (value 40) = 115 value.\nThis is a +32 value for me. Might be too aggressive for a single proposal.\n\nLet's make a smaller, more gradual offer, testing the waters for their Brick.\nMy last accepted offer was 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat for 1 Ore, 1 Brick. This implies they are okay with trading those.\nValue Offered: 3*17 + 2*5 = 51 + 10 = 61\nValue Received: 1*40 + 1*25 = 65\nNet gain of +4.\n\nI have 22 Sheep and 23 Wheat. I can afford to give some.\nWhat if I offer more Sheep and Wheat for just Brick?\nOffer: 5 Sheep (value 85), 3 Wheat (value 15) = 100 value.\nRequest: 4 Brick (value 100) and 1 Wood (value 10 for me) = 110 value. (+10 for me).\nThis looks like a fair amount of resource (8 items for 5 items) and it's a net positive value for me.\n\nFinal decision based on maximizing value and considering possible opponent needs.\nI have a lot of Ore (24) and Sheep (22) and Wheat (23). Smallest quantity of Brick (8).\nPlayer 0 is interested in my Ore, but at a bad rate. They seem to have Brick.\nI want more Brick. I can give away low-value Wheat and Sheep.\n\nLet's counter the denied Ore offer with a low-value Sheep/Wheat offer for Brick.\nI will try to get Brick using my Sheep and Wheat.\nOffer: 4 Sheep (value 68), 2 Wheat (value 10) -> 1 Ore (value 40) and 1 Brick (value 25).\nValue of my offer: 68 + 10 = 78.\nValue of my request: 40 + 25 = 65.\nThis would be a -13 value for me. No.\n\nI need to get more value back than I give.\nOffer: 3 Sheep (value 51), 3 Wheat (value 15) -> Total 66.\nRequest: 1 Ore (value 40), 1 Brick (value 25) -> Total 65.\nThis is a -1 value for me. No.\n\nOkay, let's use the positive trade I had last time (3 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick).\nI gained +4 value. I want to continue winning value.\nMy goal is clear: increase total value.\nI have an abundance of Wheat and Sheep, which are low value.\nI have a decent amount of Ore. Brick is low.\n\nPlayer 0 offered 2 Brick for 3 Ore.\nI will deny this.\nNow I need to make an offer.\nI know Player 0 values Ore, but I'm not giving it away cheaply.\nI want Brick. I can give away Wheat and Sheep.\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep (value 34), 2 Wheat (value 10). Total value 44.\nRequest: 2 Brick (value 50). Total value 50.\nThis is a +6 value gain for me. My last successful trade was +4. This isn't too greedy.\nI give away 4 low-value items. I receive 2 medium-value items. This seems like a reasonable offer.\n\nPondering the last offer from Player 0: 2 Brick -> 3 Ore.\nThis is them valuing 1 Ore at about 2/3 Brick (2 Brick for 3 Ore). Or 1 Brick at 1.5 Ore.\nCurrently 1 Ore = 40, 1 Brick = 25.\nSo their implicit ratio is 50 for 120. Very bad for me.\n\nMy counter: Offer low value items for Brick.\nI'll go with my conservative but value-positive offer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"deny_offer\": true,\n  \"offer\": {\n    \"offered_items\": {\n      \"Sheep\": 2,\n      \"Wheat\": 2\n    },\n    \"requested_items\": {\n      \"Brick\": 2\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

Brick and Wood are lower.\n*   Resource values: Ore (40) > Brick (25) > Sheep (17) > Wood (10) > Wheat (5). My priority is usually to get more high-value items and give away low-value items.\n*   Past trades and opponent's behavior: Player 0 has previously offered trades where they wanted Ore and Brick. They seem to value these. They also accepted my last trade where I got 1 Ore and 1 Brick for 3 Sheep and 2 Wheat, which was a good deal for me. They rejected my offer of 1 Ore for 2 Brick, and 1 Ore for 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, which indicates they don't want to overpay for Brick/Sheep from me. Their last offer of 2 Wood for 1 Ore was rejected by me, which was a bad offer for them to make, since 2 Wood (20) is much less than 1 Ore (40).\n\nThe current offer from Player 0 is: Offered items: 2 Wood (Value: 2 * 10 = 20) -> Requested items: 1 Ore (Value: 1 * 40 = 40).\nThis offer is terrible for me. I would lose 20 in value. I should reject this.\n\nWhat might my opponent be thinking or needing?\nPlayer 0 seems to be trying to get Ore, as evident by their previous offers. They might be running low on Ore. They might also be in need of other high-value resources. They offered 2 Wood for 1 Ore, which means they are very desperate for Ore or they are trying to undersell me. Given their previous accepted trade with me (where I gained), they might try to get a better deal for them this time.\n\nMy next move will be to make an offer that is beneficial to me. I have many Sheep and Wheat, which are lower value. I have a good amount of Ore, but it's my highest value item, so I want to be careful giving it away unless I get something very good in return. I am low on Brick.\n\nLet's consider what I can offer for Brick. I have a lot of Wheat and Sheep.\n1 Brick (25 value).\n*   Can I offer Wheat for it? 5 Wheat (25 value). This is a fair trade by value, but it uses up a lot of my Wheat.\n*   Can I offer Sheep for it? 1 Sheep (17 value). 2 Sheep (34 value). Offering 2 Sheep for 1 Brick is a loss for me (34 vs 25).\n*   What about other combinations?\n\nPlayer 0 has been trying to get Ore. This means they are likely *not* abundant in Ore.\nI have a lot of Ore. But it's my most valuable resource. I should only trade it for a significant profit, or to get something I desperately need. I'm not desperate for anything yet.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick, as it's my second highest value and I only have 8.\nI could offer a combination of lower value goods. For example, Wheat and Sheep.\nWhat if I offer 3 Sheep (51) for 2 Brick (50)? This is close to even in value, and I exchange lower-value Sheep for higher-value Brick. It's almost a 1:1 value trade (51 for 50), which is good for me because I am getting higher value resources.\n\nWhat about trying to get Ore or Brick for my low-value Wheat and Wood?\nOffer 3 Wood (30) for 1 Brick (25). This is 5 value loss for me. Not good.\nOffer 5 Wheat (25) for 1 Brick (25). This is 0 value change for me, but I exchange low-value for higher-value.\nOffer 6 Wheat (30) for 1 Brick (25). Loss for me.\n\nI need to make an offer that is appealing to the opponent, but also beneficial to me.\nPlayer 0 rejected 2 Wood for 1 Ore (my rejection). Their initial offers often involved taking my high-value items, so they might be low on them.\nLet's make an offer where I give away some lower-value items (Sheep, Wheat) to get higher-value items (Brick, Ore).\nI have a lot of Sheep and Wheat. I am relatively low on Brick.\n\nLet's propose:\nOffer: 3 Sheep (3 * 17 = 51)\nRequest: 2 Brick (2 * 25 = 50)\nThis is nearly a fair trade in value (51 for 50), and I would convert a lower-value resource (Sheep) into a higher-value resource (Brick), which is good for increasing my total resource value.\nThis might be appealing to Player 0 if they need Sheep or have extra Brick.\n\nIf I were to offer Ore, I need to get significantly more value back.\nOffer: 1 Ore (40)\nRequest: 2 Brick (50). This was an offer I made and P0 rejected before.\nRequest: 1 Brick (25) + 1 Wood (10) + 1 Wheat (5) = 40. This is a bad trade for me since I lose out on the higher-value item.\nRequest: 1 Brick + 1 Sheep = 42 (P0 rejected this)\n\nI think my best bet is to continue trying to convert my high quantity, low-value resources (Sheep, Wheat) into higher-value scarce resources (Brick).\n\nI will make the offer: 3 Sheep for 2 Brick.\nThis trade means:\n- Give: 3 Sheep (Qty 22 -> 19). Value 3 * 17 = 51.\n- Get: 2 Brick (Qty 8 -> 10). Value 2 * 25 = 50.\nNet value: 50 - 51 = -1. This is a very small value loss, but I consolidate my resources into higher-value items. It's almost a neutral value exchange while converting low-value to high-value. This is acceptable.\n\nLet's consider one more option. What if Player 0 needs Wood, as they offered it last?\nI have 15 Wood (10 value each).\nIf I offered Wood, what could I get?\nOffer: 2 Wood (20) -> Request: 1 Brick (25). This is a gain of 5 for me. (Good!)\nThis is better than 3 Sheep for 2 Brick because it's a net gain in value.\nMy Wood quantity is 15, so 2 Wood is not a lot.\nThis would also give me more Brick.\n\nLet's compare the two potential offers:\n1. Offer: 3 Sheep (51) -> Request: 2 Brick (50). Value change: -1. Qty Sheep: 22 -> 19. Qty Brick: 8 -> 10.\n2. Offer: 2 Wood (20) -> Request: 1 Brick (25). Value change: +5. Qty Wood: 15 -> 13. Qty Brick: 8 -> 9.\n\nOffer #2 is strictly better as it results in a net value gain for me, and I still get more Brick. It also uses a resource (Wood) that I have a decent quantity of, but isn't as abundant as Sheep. Player 0 just offered Wood, so they might have it.\n\nFinal Decision: Make an offer to gain Brick, while giving a smaller value resource, optimizing for a positive value difference.\n\nOffer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick.\nOffered value: 2 * 10 = 20\nRequested value: 1 * 25 = 25\nGain: 5\n\nThis is a good trade for me, both in terms of value consolidation (Wood to higher-value Brick) and absolute value gain (+5). Player 0 might accept this if they are low on Brick or have an excess of Wood.\n\n```\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n```",
