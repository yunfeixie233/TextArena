      "response": "My current resources and their total values are:\n- Wheat: 15 * 5 = 75\n- Wood: 7 * 11 = 77\n- Sheep: 19 * 18 = 342\n- Brick: 12 * 26 = 312\n- Ore: 25 * 32 = 800\n\nTotal current value: 75 + 77 + 342 + 312 + 800 = 1606\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I want to acquire resources that are more valuable to me than the resources I give away. I also want to aim for efficient trades, maximizing the value gained per trade.\n\nTo evaluate potential trades, I will calculate the change in total value.\nValue(Resources Gained) - Value(Resources Given) > 0 for a beneficial trade.\n\nFactors influencing my decision-making:\n1.  **Value Efficiency**: Prioritize trades that give me a significant net positive value.\n2.  **Resource Abundance**: I have a good quantity of Ore (25), Sheep (19), and Wheat (15). I have less Wood (7) and Brick (12).\n3.  **Resource Valuation**: Ore and Brick are my most valuable per unit resources. Wheat is my least valuable. Sheep and Wood are in the middle.\n4.  **Opponent's Potential Needs**: The opponent probably wants to increase their value too. They might value resources I have in abundance (Ore, Sheep, Wheat) more than I do, or they might have an abundance of resources I value highly (Brick, Ore, Wood).\n\nI will start by offering less valuable resources for more valuable ones, aiming for a favorable exchange rate. Wheat is my lowest value resource, so I'm most willing to trade it. Ore and Brick are my highest value resources, so I'm more hesitant to trade them unless the gain is substantial.\n\nLet's consider what I have in relative abundance and low value. Wheat is a prime candidate. I have 15 units.\nLet's consider what I have in relative scarcity and higher value to me than my abundance of Wheat: Wood (7 units). Brick (12 units) is also good. Ore (25 units) is abundant but very valuable, so I might consider trading some for other highly valued resources.\n\nI'd like to get more high-value resources like Brick or Ore, or even Wood if the trade is favorable.\nPerhaps I can trade some Wheat or Sheep for Brick or Wood.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat for something more valuable.\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (3 * 5 = 15 value), what can I ask for?\n- 1 Wood: (1 * 11 = 11 value). Net loss of 4. Not good.\n- 1 Sheep: (1 * 18 = 18 value). Net gain of 3. This is a possibility.\n- 1 Brick: (1 * 26 = 26 value). Net gain of 11. This is very good.\n- 1 Ore: (1 * 32 = 32 value). Net gain of 17. This is excellent.\n\nIt's unlikely someone will give me 1 Brick for 3 Wheat.\nWhat if I offer 5 Wheat (5 * 5 = 25 value)?\n- 1 Brick: (1 * 26 = 26 value). Net gain of 1. Small but positive.\n- 1 Ore: (1 * 32 = 32 value). Net gain of 7. Better.\n\nLet's consider trading Sheep. I have 19 Sheep (value 18).\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (2 * 18 = 36 value).\n- 1 Ore: (1 * 32 = 32 value). Net loss of 4. Not good.\n- 2 Wood: (2 * 11 = 22 value). Net loss of 14. Not good.\n- 1 Brick + 1 Wood?: (26 + 11 = 37 value). Net gain of 1. This could be interesting. 2 Sheep for 1 Brick, 1 Wood.\n\nMy best strategy might be to be slightly flexible and offer a slightly \"overvalued\" bundle for a slightly \"undervalued\" bundle of their resources, hoping they see it as a good deal for them due to different internal valuations or needs.\n\nI want to improve my Brick and Wood counts. I also want more Ore if possible, but I already have a lot.\n\nLet's try an offer that includes my lower value resource (Wheat) and maybe some Sheep, to acquire higher value resources (Brick, Wood, Ore).\n\nConsider offering 4 Wheat (value 20) + 1 Sheep (value 18) = total 38 value.\nWhat can I ask for?\n- 1 Brick (value 26) + 1 Wood (value 11) = total 37 value. Net loss of 1. Not good.\n- 1 Ore (value 32) + 1 Wood (value 11) = total 43 value. Net gain of 5. This is decent.\n- 1 Ore (value 32) + 1 Wheat (value 5) = total 37 value. Net loss of 1.\n- 1 Brick (value 26) + 1 Sheep (value 18) = total 44 value. Net gain of 6. This is good.\n\nI will try to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me valuing my resources correctly, while hopefully appearing beneficial or at least not harmful to the opponent.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick, as I have less of it than Ore.\nOffer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep (3*5 + 1*18 = 15+18 = 33 value)\nRequest: 1 Brick, 1 Wood (1*26 + 1*11 = 26+11 = 37 value)\nNet gain: 37 - 33 = +4 value. This is a positive trade for me. It could be appealing to an opponent who needs Wheat or Sheep.\n\nLet's verify this proposed offer.\nOffer: 3 Wheat (low value, abundant) and 1 Sheep (mid value, abundant).\nRequest: 1 Brick (high value, relatively scarce) and 1 Wood (mid value, scarce).\nThis seems like a good opening offer aiming for quality resources I'm relatively low on from my perspective, by trading resources I'm abundant in.\n\nFinal decision: [Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood]\nReasoning:\n- **My Value Given**: 3 Wheat * 5 + 1 Sheep * 18 = 15 + 18 = 33\n- **My Value Received**: 1 Brick * 26 + 1 Wood * 11 = 26 + 11 = 37\n- **Net Gain**: +4 value. This improves my total resource value.\n- **Resource Strategy**: I am trading highly abundant, lower-value resources (Wheat, Sheep) for less abundant, higher-value resources (Brick, Wood), which aligns with my goal of improving my overall resource portfolio.\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood]",

This means I should aim to trade away resources where I have a high quantity or relatively low value per unit, for resources that have a high value per unit, or which I have in lower quantities.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the values:\n- Wheat: 5 (lowest value per unit)\n- Wood: 11\n- Sheep: 18\n- Brick: 26\n- Ore: 32 (highest value per unit)\n\nPlayer 1 rejected my previous offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood.\nLet's analyze that offer from my perspective by looking at the change in value:\nOffered: (3 * 5 Wheat) + (1 * 18 Sheep) = 15 + 18 = 33\nRequested: (1 * 26 Brick) + (1 * 11 Wood) = 26 + 11 = 37\nNet gain in value for me: 37 - 33 = 4. This was a good offer for me.\n\nPlayer 1 rejected it, which suggests they didn't see enough value in it, or perhaps they didn't need Wood or Brick.\n\nMy strategy should focus on:\n1.  **Getting rid of low-value items:** Wheat (value 5), and potentially Wood (value 11) or Sheep (value 18) if I can get higher value items in return. I have a lot of Wheat (15), so it's a good candidate for trading away. I also have a decent amount of Sheep (19).\n2.  **Acquiring high-value items:** Ore (value 32) and Brick (value 26). I have a lot of Ore (25), so while it's high value, I might also be able to trade some if the return is excellent. I have 12 Brick, which is okay, but I'm open to more.\n\nConsider what Player 1 might want. Since I don't know Player 1's resources or goals, I need to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me, but also potentially appealing to them.\n\nLet's think of another offer. I still want to offload Wheat. I have 15 Wheat.\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of Wheat for a smaller quantity of high-value items?\n\nLet's try to get more Brick or Ore.\n\n**Option 1: Trade Wheat for Brick/Ore**\nI could offer 4 Wheat (value 20) for 1 Brick (value 26). Net gain of 6. This is good for me.\nOr 5 Wheat (value 25) for 1 Brick (value 26). Net gain of 1. Still positive.\nOr 6 Wheat (value 30) for 1 Ore (value 32). Net gain of 2.\n\n**Option 2: Trade Sheep for Ore/Brick**\nI have 19 Sheep (value 18).\nCould I offer 1 Sheep (value 18) for 1 Wood (value 11) and 1 Wheat (value 5)? Value given up 18, value gained 16. Not good for me.\nWhat about offering Sheep to get Brick or Ore?\n1 Sheep (value 18) for 1 Brick (value 26)? Net gain of 8. This is very good for me.\nWhat if I bundle Wheat and Sheep?\n\nLet's reconsider the last offer and why it was rejected. It was 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood. My gain was 4. Player 1 might have thought it wasn't enough for them, or they didn't need Wood, or they valued what I gave up less.\n\nI need to make an offer where *I* gain value, but also *they* might feel it's fair or beneficial.\nLet's try to offer mostly low-value items for higher-value ones.\n\nMy lowest value item is Wheat (5). My second lowest is Wood (11).\nMy highest value item is Ore (32). My second highest is Brick (26).\n\nI want to increase my *overall* value, not just trade small amounts.\nI have a good quantity of Wheat (15) and Sheep (19). I should use these for trading.\n\nHow about offering Wheat and Wood?\nLet's try to get Ore, as it's the highest value.\nWhat if I offer 5 Wheat (value 25) and 1 Wood (value 11) for 1 Ore (value 32)?\nTotal offered: 25 + 11 = 36\nTotal requested: 32\nNet gain for me: 32 - 36 = -4. This is a bad trade for me.\n\nThe key is to give up less value than I receive.\n\nLet's aim for 1 Ore.\nTo get 1 Ore (value 32):\n- I could offer 6 Wheat (value 30). This would be +2 for me.\n- I could offer 2 Wood (value 22) and 2 Wheat (value 10) = 32. This would be 0 gain. Not good.\n\nLet's try to get Brick.\nTo get 1 Brick (value 26):\n- I could offer 5 Wheat (value 25). This would be +1 for me. Small gain, but positive.\n- I could offer 1 Wood (value 11) and 3 Wheat (value 15) = 26. This would be 0 gain. Not good.\n\nI need to aim for offers where I get a net gain of at least 5-10, to make it worthwhile and absorb potential miscalculations of opponent's needs.\n\nConsider trading away some of my abundant Sheep (value 18).\nWhat if I offer Sheep for Brick?\n1 Sheep (18) for 1 Brick (26)? Gain 8. This looks good.\nI have 19 Sheep, so I can afford to trade some.\n\nHere's an idea: Offer items that I have in abundance (Wheat, Sheep) for items that are high value (Brick, Ore).\n\nLet's try a simpler offer with a clear value proposition for me.\nOffer 2 Sheep (value 36) for 1 Ore (value 32) and 1 Wood (value 11)?\nOffered: 2 * 18 = 36\nRequested: 1 * 32 + 1 * 11 = 43\nNet gain: 43 - 36 = 7. This is a very good trade for me.\nI have 19 Sheep, losing 2 is fine. I receive my highest value item (Ore) and another less valuable Wood, which I currently have 7 of. Player 1 might want Sheep if they are short.\n\nLet's confirm my current situation before offering:\n- Wheat: 15 (value 5)\n- Wood: 7 (value 11)\n- Sheep: 19 (value 18)\n- Brick: 12 (value 26)\n- Ore: 25 (value 32)\n\nLet's formulate the offer:\nOffer 2 Sheep -> Request 1 Ore and 1 Wood.\nValue out: 2 * 18 = 36\nValue in: 1 * 32 + 1 * 11 = 43\nNet gain = 7. This is a decent gain. And it gives Player 1 variety (Ore and Wood) for their Sheep.\n\nWhat if they don't want Wood?\nAlternative: Offer 2 Sheep -> Request 1 Ore.\nValue out: 2 * 18 = 36\nValue in: 1 * 32 = 32\nNet gain = -4. Bad for me.\n\nSo it seems the 2 Sheep for 1 Ore and 1 Wood is my best bet for now. It targets getting the highest value item (Ore) and gives away a mid-value item (Sheep) that I have plenty of.\n\nLet's consider if I can improve on the last offer which was rejected (3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood).\nValue out: 33. Value in: 37. Gain: 4.\nIt makes sense why Player 1 rejected it as their gain (if any) was likely very small from their perspective.\n\nI should make an offer that feels more generous to Player 1, without hurting my total value.\nWhat if I offer more low-value items for a high-value item?\n\nTry to acquire Brick.\nI have 15 Wheat.\nOffer 5 Wheat (value 25) for 1 Brick (value 26). Gain 1. Too low.\nOffer 6 Wheat (value 30) for 1 Brick (value 26). Loss 4. Bad.\n\nWhat about a multi-resource offer?\nI want to get Ore (32) or Brick (26). I want to give Wheat (5), Wood (11), and/or Sheep (18).\n\nProposal: Give 3 Wheat (value 15) and 1 Wood (value 11) for 1 Brick (value 26).\nValue out: 15 + 11 = 26\nValue in: 26\nNet gain: 0. This is a break-even trade. Not ideal for me, as I need to *increase* my total value.\n\nI must ensure a positive value change for myself.\nLet's try to get 1 Ore (value 32).\nOffer: I give 2 Sheep (value 36) -> Request 1 Ore (value 32)\nResult: -4. No.\n\nWhat about offering a large quantity of a low-value item for a single high-value item?\nExample: 7 Wheat (value 35) for 1 Ore (value 32). Loss of 3. No.\nExample: 6 Sheep (value 108) for 3 Ore (value 96). Loss of 12. No.\n\nThis means to guarantee a gain, I must request something that on balance adds more value than what I give up.\nI'm going back to my best idea:\nOffer 2 Sheep (value 36) -> Request 1 Ore (value 32) and 1 Wood (value 11)\nValue out: 36\nValue in: 43\nNet gain: 7. This is good for me. Player 1 gets 2 Sheep, which are relatively valuable from my perspective (18 units per piece). Player 1 gives up 1 Ore (most valuable) and 1 Wood (mid-value). Player 1 might need Sheep, so this could be attractive. I hold a total of 19 Sheep, so trading 2 is fine. I would increase my Ore count (currently 25).\n\nI need to make sure I don't give away too much of my highest value item. I hold a lot of Ore (25).\nIf I trade away some Ore, I need to get back even more value.\nOffer 1 Ore (value 32) and 1 Wheat (value 5) -> Request 2 Brick (value 52)?\nValue out: 37\nValue in: 52\nNet gain: 15. This is excellent for me! I have 25 Ore, so giving up 1 is okay if the return is so high. I have 15 Wheat, so giving 1 is also good. I would gain 2 Brick, getting closer to Ore's value. This seems like a strong offer. Player 1 would get high-value Ore and low-value Wheat, potentially useful if they have a lot of Brick.\n\nLet's consider this new optimal trade:\nOffer: 1 [Ore], 1 [Wheat]\nRequest: 2 [Brick]\nMy current resources:\nWheat: 15 * 5 = 75\nWood: 7 * 11 = 77\nSheep: 19 * 18 = 342\nBrick: 12 * 26 = 312\nOre: 25 * 32 = 800\nTotal = 1606\n\nIf trade is accepted:\nResources offered: 1 Ore, 1 Wheat\nValue offered: (1 * 32) + (1 * 5) = 37\n\nResources requested: 2 Brick\nValue requested: (2 * 26) = 52\n\nNet value change for me: 52 - 37 = +15.\nThis is a substantial gain. It leaves me with 24 Ore, 14 Wheat, and would increase my Brick to 14.\nThis looks like a good offer.\nPlayer 1 gets a very valuable item (Ore) and some low-value Wheat, in exchange for two mid-to-high value Bricks. This could be attractive if Player 1 is low on Ore or needs Wheat for something.\n\nI will propose this.\n[Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",

Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\nMy previous offers have been rejected. Player 1 seems reluctant to trade valuable resources for less valuable ones. I have a lot of Ore and a lot of Sheep, with high individual values. I also have a decent amount of Brick, which has a good individual value. Wood and Wheat are my lowest value items per unit.\n\nI need to make an offer that is more appealing to Player 1 or reflects a better value exchange for me. Player 1 hasn't revealed any specific needs, but they offered to give up Wheat and Sheep for Ore and Wood, suggesting they might value Ore and Wood more than Sheep and Wheat. This is consistent with general resource values (Ore > Wood > Sheep > Wheat).\n\nI want to get rid of some low-value Wheat if possible, or exchange some high-quantity Sheep for higher-value items. I have 25 Ore, which is a lot. While it's my highest value per unit, I might be able to trade some of it if I get a good enough return. I'm also fairly low on Wood.\n\nLet's try to offer some of my abundant high-value resources (like Sheep or even some Ore, but not too much Ore) for scarcer or higher-value-per unit resources like Brick or Wood.\n\nConsider offering some Sheep for Wood or Brick.\nI have 19 Sheep (value 18). Player 1 might value Sheep if they offered it to me.\nI have 7 Wood (value 11). I might want more Wood.\nI have 12 Brick (value 26). I would like more Brick.\n\nLet's try to offer some Sheep for Brick, or maybe an Ore for Brick if I can get enough back. My last offer involved 1 Ore and 1 Wheat for 2 Brick, which was rejected. That was a gain of 52 - 37 = 15. The player rejected it, implying they either don't want Brick or think my offer is too low for their Ore/Wheat. However, in the current offer from P1, they *requested* Ore.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of my abundant Sheep for something I value more, like Brick or Wood?\n\nOption 1: Offer many Sheep for some Brick.\n- Offer: 3 Sheep (54 value) -> 1 Brick (26 value). (Bad for me) No.\n\nOption 2: Try to get Wood.\n- Offer: 2 Sheep (36 value) -> 2 Wood (22 value). (Bad for me) No.\n\nOption 3: Combine some low-value Wheat with some Sheep for something better.\n- Offer: 2 Wheat (10) + 2 Sheep (36) = 46 value. What could I get? 1 Brick (26) + 1 Wood (11)? Total 37. Still a loss.\n\nWhat if I assume Player 1 *does* want Ore, given their last offer?\nThey offered to trade 1 Wheat (5) + 3 Sheep (54) = 59 for 1 Ore (32) + 1 Wood (11) = 43. This means they are willing to give up 59 value to get 43 value, which is very disadvantageous for them. This suggests they *really* want Ore and Wood, or they are very desperate for it. However, it's also possible they simply miscalculated, or value Ore/Wood much higher than their \"market\" value.\n\nLet's assume they highly value Ore. I have 25 Ore.\nIf I can trade Ore for something with even higher value/unit, that would be ideal, but Ore is already the highest. I want to trade it for items that will increase my *total* value.\n\nLet's rethink their offer: 1 Wheat (5), 3 Sheep (54) -> 1 Ore (32), 1 Wood (11).\nThey want Ore and Wood. I have a lot of Ore. I want more Wood.\n\nI have an abundance of Ore (25) and Sheep (19). I am low on Wood (7). Brick (12) is decent. Wheat (15) is okay.\n\nLet's try an offer where I give up some Ore and some Sheep, for a good amount of Wood and/or Brick.\nIf I give 1 Ore (32) and 1 Sheep (18) = 50 value.\nWhat could I get? 1 Brick (26) and 2 Wood (22) = 48 value. Still a slight loss.\n\nHow about trying to leverage my abundance of Sheep for something.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (54 value) for 2 Brick (52 value). This is almost neutral, and I reduce my high-quantity Sheep for high-value Brick. It's a slight loss of 2 value, but gets rid of quantity.\n\nWhat if I try to get some more valuable Wood.\nOffer: 3 Sheep -> 3 Wood (33). Loss of 21. No.\n\nI need to make an offer that feels like a win for me.\n\nLet's consider that Player 1 values Ore highly. What if I offer something like generous amount of Sheep and some Wheat for Brick and Wood?\n\nTry this:\nOffer: 2 Wheat (10) + 3 Sheep (54) = 64 total value.\nRequest: 2 Brick (52) + 1 Wood (11) = 63 total value.\nThis is almost a neutral trade (-1 value), but I get rid of low-value Wheat and some high-quantity Sheep, for higher value Brick and needed Wood. This reduces quantity of Sheep and Wheat, which is good. Player 1 gave me Sheep and Wheat and asked for Wood and Ore, so they might be interested in these resources.\n\nLet's reconsider the latest P1 offer and its implied values for P1:\nP1 wants: 1 Ore (32) + 1 Wood (11) = 43 value (from my perspective)\nP1 offers: 1 Wheat (5) + 3 Sheep (54) = 59 value (from my perspective)\nFrom P1's perspective, they value Ore highly relative to Wheat/Sheep. If they are willing to give up 59 value for 43 value, then they must value Ore *at least* 16 more than I do, or they are desperately seeking it.\n\nI have a lot of Ore. Can I exploit this perceived high value from P1?\nI could try to trade 1 Ore for a very good return.\nIf I offer 1 Ore (32). What if I ask for 2 Brick (52)? This is a great deal for me (gain of 20). But P1 rejected a similar offer (1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick). Maybe they don't want Brick *from me*, or my price was too high.\n\nLet's go back to something that increases my value.\nI have a lot of Sheep and Ore. Wood is low. Brick is good.\nIf I can consolidate some Sheep into Brick or Wood, that would be good.\n\nLet's make an offer that gives me a clear value increase and might tempt Player 1 based on their last offer.\nThey want Ore and Wood. I have Ore.\nIf I offer: 1 Ore (32)\nI want: 1 Brick (26) and 1 Wood (11) = 37. Gain of 5.\nThis might be perceived as fair by them, as they showed they value Ore highly and they asked for Wood. They give up Brick which is also high value.\n\nLet's check the quantities again:\nWheat: 15 (5)\nWood: 7 (11) - Low\nSheep: 19 (18) - High\nBrick: 12 (26) - Medium-High\nOre: 25 (32) - High\n\nMy goal is to increase total value.\nMy previous offers:\n1. 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep (3*5+18=33) -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood (26+11=37). Gained 4. Rejected.\n2. 1 Ore, 1 Wheat (32+5=37) -> 2 Brick (52). Gained 15. Rejected.\n\nPlayer 1 has rejected trades where I stood to gain a small amount (4) and a decent amount (15).\nPlayer 1's offer was bad for them, but showed a high demand for Ore and Wood:\n1 Wheat, 3 Sheep (59) -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood (43). P1 would lose 16.\n\nGiven P1's high perceived value for Ore, I should try to trade Ore for a net gain.\nI have 25 Ore. I can afford to part with some.\n\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (36) for 1 Brick (26) + 1 Wood (11) = 37. A gain of 1 value. Small, but positive. Player 1 offered Sheep. Maybe they have a lot.\n\nWhat if I offer something I have a LOT of, like Sheep, for something P1 wants (Ore/Wood), but make it a good deal for me?\nP1 wants Ore/Wood.\nIf I offer 5 Sheep (value 90) for 2 Ore (value 64). P1 gets Ore but it's bad for them.\n\nLet's reconsider Player 1's current offer.\nPlayer 1 offered: 1 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood\nThis offer is bad for me (lose 16 value). So, I *must* reject it.\n\nNow, I need to make an offer.\nI want to increase my total value, and preferably gain some Wood.\n\nLet's try to offer some of my abundant Ore for something good.\nGiven P1 rejected my previous Ore offer (1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick), maybe they don't value Brick high enough, or they think my Ore is worth even more than 2 Brick. They did offer to exchange a lot of their value (59) for 1 Ore (32), suggesting they value my Ore >= 59. This is an enormous discrepancy in value.\n\nIf their valuation of 1 Ore is 59, and my valuation of 1 Ore is 32, I have a massive opportunity.\nIf I offer 1 Ore (my 32 value) and ask for 2 Brick (my 52 value). They rejected this previously.\nWhy? If they value my Ore at 59, they'd accept 2 Brick (52) for it as gain of 7 (59-52=7).\nThis means my assumption that they value Ore at 59 is wrong, or they also value Brick highly.\n\nLet's try to focus on the resources they offered and requested: Wheat & Sheep for Ore & Wood.\nThey have Wheat and Sheep to spare, and they need Ore and Wood.\n\nI have:\nWheat: 15 (abundant)\nWood: 7 (scarce)\nSheep: 19 (abundant)\nBrick: 12 (medium)\nOre: 25 (abundant)\n\nI want more Wood. I have a lot of Sheep and Ore. I have some Wheat.\nLet's offer some Wheat and Sheep for Wood.\nOffer: 2 Wheat (10) + 2 Sheep (36) = 46 value\nRequest: 3 Wood (33) + 1 Brick (26) = 59 value.\nThis is a gain of 13 for me. I get rid of low value Wheat and plentiful Sheep, and get valuable Wood and Brick. This might be appealing because I'm offering them what they offered to me (Wheat/Sheep) but asking for different things that they also showed interest in (Wood or something similar in value like Brick).\n\nLet's double-check the calculations for my proposed offer:\n- **Offered resources:**\n    - 2 Wheat: 2 * 5 = 10\n    - 2 Sheep: 2 * 18 = 36\n    - **Total value offered: 46**\n- **Requested resources:**\n    - 3 Wood: 3 * 11 = 33\n    - 1 Brick: 1 * 26 = 26\n    - **Total value requested: 59**\n- **Net change in value for me:** 59 - 46 = +13\n\nThis looks like a good offer for me. It leverages my abundant Wheat and Sheep, and gains me much-needed Wood and higher-value Brick. It also aligns with the types of resources Player 1 was willing to exchange (offered Wheat/Sheep, requested Wood/Ore).\nI will deny Player 1's current offer, as it results in a net loss for me.\nMy turn is to make an offer, so first I will deal with the incoming offer.\nMy reasoning for denying is clearly stated above: 43 (gained) - 59 (given) = -16 value.\n\nAfter denying, I make my new offer.\nMy current total value is 1606. If accepted, my new total value would be 1606 - 46 + 59 = 1619. This is a good increase.\nMy resources after trade:\nWheat: 15 - 2 = 13 (Value 65)\nWood: 7 + 3 = 10 (Value 110)\nSheep: 19 - 2 = 17 (Value 306)\nBrick: 12 + 1 = 13 (Value 338)\nOre: 25 (Value 800)\nTotal: 65+110+306+338+800 = 1619. The calculation is consistent.\n\nFinal check on the offer:\n- Does it make sense for P1? They offered Wheat and Sheep in their previous turn. I'm taking Wheat and Sheep. They asked for Wood and Ore. I'm giving them Wheat and Sheep in exchange for Wood and Brick. Maybe they have too much Wheat and Sheep anyway. Brick is also a good resource.\n- Is it balanced enough for them to accept?\n  - From their perspective, they give up 3 Wood (33) + 1 Brick (26) = 59.\n  - They gain 2 Wheat (10) + 2 Sheep (36) = 46.\n  - This would be a loss of 13 for them. This is the same magnitude of loss for them as I would have had if I accepted their offer. This might be too much for them to accept.\n\nI need to reconsider. I should aim for a more balanced offer if I want it to be accepted, yet still make a profit.\nIf Player 1 rejected my previous offer (1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick) where I gained 15, then an offer where they *lose* 13 might also be rejected.\n\nLet's try to shrink my gain, to make it more appealing to Player 1.\nI want Wood and Brick. They want Ore and Wood, and have Sheep and Wheat.\n\nLet's offer some Sheep for Wood.\nOffer: 2 Sheep (36)\nRequest: 3 Wood (33). This is a loss of 3 for me. No.\n\nOffer: 3 Sheep (54)\nRequest: 1 Brick (26) + 2 Wood (22) = 48. Loss of 6 for me. No.\n\nMy current resource profile:\nWheat: 15 (5) - okay\nWood: 7 (11) - low, need more\nSheep: 19 (18) - high, good to trade\nBrick: 12 (26) - medium, good\nOre: 25 (32) - high, good to trade\n\nPlayer 1 wants Ore and Wood. I want Wood.\nLet's try to use my Ore to get Wood and maybe Brick.\nIf I offer 1 Ore (32)\nAnd ask for:\n- 1 Brick (26) + 1 Wood (11) = 37. I gain 5. This was rejected earlier (implied by first rejected offer). No, my offer for 1 Ore, 1 Wheat for 2 Brick was rejected. This is different. This is 1 Ore for 1 Brick and 1 Wood.\n  - This means Player 1 would give up 1 Brick and 1 Wood (37 value) to get 1 Ore (32 value from my perspective).\n  - From P1's side, they would lose 5 if they use my valuation. But P1 valued Ore at 59 in their bad offer. If they value Ore at 59, and Wood and Brick at my values, then they would gain 59 - 37 = 22. This should be a very attractive offer to them.\n\nThis looks like a good candidate for an offer.\nMy current value: 1606.\nOffer: 1 Ore (32)\nRequest: 1 Brick (26), 1 Wood (11)\nNet change if accepted: + (26+11) - 32 = +5.\nMy new total value would be 1606 + 5 = 1611.\nThis is a positive gain, and it gets me some Wood which I'm low on.\nIt might be appealing to P1 as they showed high demand for Ore. And I'm requesting Wood (which they asked for) and Brick (a valuable resource).\n\nLet's double-check.\nMy resources after the trade:\nWheat: 15 (75)\nWood: 7 + 1 = 8 (88)\nSheep: 19 (342)\nBrick: 12 + 1 = 13 (338)\nOre: 25 - 1 = 24 (768)\nTotal: 75+88+342+338+768 = 1611. Correct.\n\nThis is a good, low-risk, positive value trade for me. And it should be attractive to Player 1 if they genuinely value Ore highly as indicated by their previous (bad) offer to me.\nThe previous rejection of 1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick was a gain of 15 for me. Perhaps that was too aggressive. This offer has a smaller gain of 5, which might be more acceptable for them.\n\nI will proceed with denying the current incoming offer, then make this new offer.I will first evaluate Player 1's offer.\nPlayer 1 offered: 1 Wheat (value 5) + 3 Sheep (value 3 * 18 = 54) = Total value 59\nPlayer 1 requested: 1 Ore (value 32) + 1 Wood (value 11) = Total value 43\n\nIf I accept this offer, I would give up 59 units of value and gain 43 units of value. This is a net loss of 16 units of value for me (43 - 59 = -16). My primary goal is to increase my total resource value, so I must reject this offer.\n\nNow I need to formulate my own offer.\nMy current resources and their values are:\n*   Wheat: 15 (Value 5 per unit) -> Total 75\n*   Wood: 7 (Value 11 per unit) -> Total 77 (Low quantity)\n*   Sheep: 19 (Value 18 per unit) -> Total 342 (High quantity)\n*   Brick: 12 (Value 26 per unit) -> Total 312\n*   Ore: 25 (Value 32 per unit) -> Total 800 (High quantity)\nMy current total value is 1606.\n\nMy previous offers were rejected by Player 1.\n1.  Offered: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep (Total value 33). Requested: 1 Brick, 1 Wood (Total value 37). My gain: +4. (Rejected)\n2.  Offered: 1 Ore, 1 Wheat (Total value 37). Requested: 2 Brick (Total value 52). My gain: +15. (Rejected)\n\nPlayer 1's last offer to me (1 Wheat, 3 Sheep for 1 Ore, 1 Wood) shows a very high perceived value for Ore on their part, as they were willing to take a significant loss (giving up 59 value to get 43 value, a -16 net value for them). This suggests they might be in high need of Ore. They also requested Wood in that offer.\n\nI have a large quantity of Ore (25 units) and Wood is my lowest quantity resource (7 units). I want to increase my total value and ideally acquire more Wood.\n\nI will try to leverage Player 1's apparent high demand for Ore. If I offer Ore, and request resources that I need (Wood) and another valuable resource (Brick), I might get an offer accepted that benefits me.\n\nConsider the following offer:\n*   **I offer:** 1 Ore (My value: 32)\n*   **I request:** 1 Brick (My value: 26) and 1 Wood (My value: 11) = Total value 37\n\nLet's analyze this proposed trade from my perspective:\n*   Value given up: 32 (1 Ore)\n*   Value gained: 26 (1 Brick) + 11 (1 Wood) = 37\n*   Net change in my value: +37 - 32 = +5\n\nThis trade results in a positive gain of 5 value for me, increasing my total value from 1606 to 1611. It also provides me with some much-needed Wood.\n\nFrom Player 1's perspective:\nIf Player 1 accepts, they would give up 1 Brick and 1 Wood (my value 37) and gain 1 Ore (my value 32). This looks like a loss of 5 for them using my valuation.\nHowever, considering their previous desperate offer (giving up 59 value for 1 Ore and 1 Wood, i.e. 43 value), they seem to value Ore significantly higher than I do. If they valued 1 Ore at 59 (from their offer calculation), and they give up 1 Brick (26) and 1 Wood (11), their gain would be 59 (their perceived Ore value) - 37 (my value for Brick/Wood) = +22. This would be a very attractive gain for them.\n\nThis offer provides a positive value increase for me (+5) and it is highly likely to be accepted by Player 1 given their expressed desire for Ore and their willingness to trade for it at a seemingly large personal loss in their previous offer.\n\nMy decision:\n1.  Deny the incoming offer from Player 1.\n2.  Make a new offer: 1 Ore for 1 Brick and 1 Wood.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood]",

Total requested: 43. This was a bad offer for me (I'd lose 16 value), so I rejected it.\n*   Player 0 offered: 1 Ore (32) -> 1 Brick (26), 1 Wood (11). Total offered: 32. Total requested: 37. Another seemingly good offer for me, but P1 rejected it. This consistently suggests P1 might not want Brick, or they have a high value for it themselves and won't part with it. They also seem unwilling to part with Wood.\n\nAnalysis of Player 1's behavior:\nPlayer 1 has rejected all my offers where I requested Brick or Wood. They also made an offer asking for Ore and Wood, offering Wheat and Sheep. This suggests P1 *wants* Ore and Wood, and *has* Wheat and Sheep to spare, or values them less.\n\nMy strategy for this turn:\nGiven P1's consistent rejection of my requests for Brick and Wood, and their own offer, I should try to offer resources that I have in abundance and value less (Wheat, Sheep) in exchange for resources that I value more (Ore, though I have plenty, or maybe Wood if I want to diversify). However, Player 1 seems to want Ore. I can try to give up some low-value resources for Ore, even though I have a lot. This would increase my total value, assuming I can get a good ratio.\n\nLet's re-evaluate my desire for Brick, given P1's resistance. It might be better to try and get resources that P1 seems willing to part with, which might be less clear.\n\nSince P1 asked for Ore and Wood, and offered Wheat and Sheep, it gives me some insight. They have Wheat and Sheep to spare, and want high-value items.\nI have a significant amount of Ore (25 Qty, 32 Value). I'm rich in Ore.\nI also have a lot of Sheep (19 Qty, 18 Value) and Wheat (15 Qty, 5 Value), which are lower value.\n\nPerhaps I should offer something more attractive to Player 1, something they explicitly want, but still ensure my net value increases. P1 wants Ore. I have a lot of Ore. Can I trade low-value resources for something I want more, or simply get a net value increase by giving up some Ore, but still gaining more value back?\n\nLet's try to get Brick or Wood again, but this time offering something P1 really wants (Ore), but pairing it with something cheap to reduce the cost to me, and request something small. The previous offer of 1 Ore for 1 Brick, 1 Wood was good for me, but P1 rejected.\n\nWhat if I offer low-value items directly for Ore? That might be too beneficial for me.\n\nLet's try a different approach, appealing to what P1 explicitly requested in their last offer (Ore and Wood). Maybe I *offer* Ore (which seems to be high on P1's wants list) but demand a very high return in lower-value goods that I can turn around, or just gain net value. This is risky as I'm giving up my most valuable resource.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to offload more Sheep and Wheat, since I have plenty and they are low value.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of low value items for one valuable item?\nExample: 8 Sheep (144) for 4 Brick (104) and 1 Wood (11). Offer > Request. No.\n\nLet's reconsider Player 1's explicit offer: 1 Wheat (5), 3 Sheep (54) -> 1 Ore (32), 1 Wood (11).\nThey offered 59 value and requested 43 value. This was a bad deal for me.\nIt tells me they are willing to part with Wheat and Sheep.\nIt tells me they want Ore and Wood.\n\nI have 25 Ore. That's a lot. I have 12 Brick.\nMy goal is to increase total value.\nI have plenty of low-value Wheat and Sheep.\nI have plenty of high-value Ore.\n\nWhat if I try to get Brick, but offer something that P1 might want, and is willing to trade?\nLet's offer a combination of resources P1 previously offered (Wheat/Sheep) plus some of my own value (Ore) to get a high-value item like Brick. This seems counter-intuitive.\n\nOk, let's simplify. I want to convert low-value resources into high-value resources.\nI have 15 Wheat (5 value), 19 Sheep (18 value).\nI want more Brick (26 value), more Wood (11 value).\n\nPlayer 1 has consistently rejected my requests for Brick and Wood. This suggests they either don't have enough, or value them very highly.\nPlayer 1 has shown a willingness to part with Wheat and Sheep.\nPlayer 1 has shown a desire for Ore.\n\nThe player has rejected offers where I acquire Brick. This may mean that the player needs Brick.\nSo I should not request Brick from the Player.\nI have a lot of Ore. Player 1 wants Ore. This is an intersection.\nI could offer Ore for something and make a gain.\n\nLet's try to offer excess low-value items for higher-value items.\nI have 15 Wheat (Value 5). I have 19 Sheep (Value 18).\nI have 25 Ore (Value 32). This is my most valuable resource.\n\nI will try to trade low-value items for high-value items, focusing on what P1 has hinted they might be willing to trade.\nP1 offered Wheat and Sheep. This implies they have them and value them lower.\nLet's try to trade my cheap Wheat/Sheep for something else.\n\nWhat if I try to acquire Wood, as it's mid-value and I don't have a huge quantity?\nMy current Wood quantity is 7. Brick is 12.\n\nLet's try to offer 3 Sheep (54 value) and 1 Wheat (5 value) = 59 value.\nWhat can I get for 59 value?\nMaybe 2 Wood (22) + 1 Brick (26) = 48. This is a loss for P1.\nPerhaps 1 Ore (32) and 1 Wood (11) = 43. This is exactly what P1 offered *me* for 1 Wheat and 3 Sheep.\nSo P1 offered 1 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood. This was 59 value offered by P1, getting 43 in return. This was a bad trade for me.\n\nSo if P1 believes 1 Ore, 1 Wood is equivalent to 1 Wheat, 3 Sheep, then I can use this.\nI offer 1 Ore (32) and I ask for 1 Wheat (5) and 3 Sheep (54).\nValue Offered: 32. Value Requested: 59. This is excellent for me. But I'm giving Player 1 what *they* want (Ore) in exchange for what *they* are willing to give (Wheat, Sheep).\nThis might appeal to Player 1 because they get their desired Ore. I give them less value (32) than I get (59).\nThis is a risky play as I'm giving up my most valuable resource, but I have 25 of it.\n\nLet's try this: Offer 1 Ore for 3 Sheep and 1 Wheat.\nValue offered by me: 1 Ore (32)\nValue received by me: 3 Sheep (18*3 = 54) + 1 Wheat (5) = 59.\nNet gain for me: 59 - 32 = 27. This is a very good gain.\nPlayer 1 accepted an offer like this where *they* were getting 1 Ore and 1 Wood for 1 Wheat and 3 Sheep.\nNow I'm offering them 1 Ore for 1 Wheat and 3 Sheep. This is directly the inverse of their previous bad offer to me.\nSince they offered it to me before, they must find some value in this exchange.\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\nMy reasoning step by step:\n1.  **Analyze current situation**: I have abundant high-value Ore and abundant low-value Wheat/Sheep.\n2.  **Review past trades**: P1 consistently rejected my requests for Brick/Wood. P1 offered 1 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood, which was a bad trade for me showing P1 wants Ore/Wood and has Wheat/Sheep.\n3.  **Identify P1's needs/wants**: P1 clearly wants Ore and seems willing to part with Wheat/Sheep.\n4.  **Identify my opportunity**: I have surplus Ore and a desire to turn low-value items into higher value or simply increase my net worth. I can capitalize on P1's desire for Ore.\n5.  **Formulate a beneficial offer**: Offer my high-value resource (Ore) to P1, but demand a quantity of their low-value resources (Wheat/Sheep) that results in a net value gain for me.\n6.  **Calculate proposed offer**:\n    *   Offer: 1 Ore (Value: 32)\n    *   Request: 3 Sheep (Value: 3 * 18 = 54) + 1 Wheat (Value: 5)\n    *   Total Value Requested: 54 + 5 = 59\n    *   Net Gain for me: 59 (Requested) - 32 (Offered) = +27\n7.  **Evaluate against P1's past behavior**: P1 previously offered the exact inverse (1 Wheat, 3 Sheep for 1 Ore, 1 Wood). If they thought giving up 1 Wheat and 3 Sheep was worth 1 Ore and 1 Wood (43 value), then offering them just 1 Ore for the same amount of Wheat/Sheep (59 value for me) would be a logical fit for them, especially if they desperately need Ore. I'm essentially giving them the Ore they want, for something they have in excess and previously offered.\nThis is a good risk-reward trade for me. I gain 27 value.\n\nPre-computation and thoughts:\nIf I give 1 Ore (32) I get back 3 Sheep (54) and 1 Wheat (5). My gain is 27. I still have 24 Ore, which is plenty. This is a good trade.\nPlayer 1 offered \"1 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood\". That's (5+54=59) Player 1 offered (32+11=43) Player 1 requested. Player 1 would lose 16 value. I rejected that.\nNow I'm offering \"1 Ore -> 1 Wheat, 3 Sheep\". That's (32) I offered (5+54=59) I requested. I gain 27 value.\nThis is exactly the type of trade I'm looking for - good for me, and hopefully palatable for P1 given their previous offer and desire for Ore.\n\nTotal value of my current resources:\n15*5 + 7*11 + 19*18 + 12*26 + 25*32\n75 + 77 + 342 + 312 + 800 = 1606\n\nIf the trade goes through:\nResources after trade:\nWheat: 15 + 1 = 16\nWood: 7\nSheep: 19 + 3 = 22\nBrick: 12\nOre: 25 - 1 = 24\n\nNew Total Value:\n16*5 + 7*11 + 22*18 + 12*26 + 24*32\n80 + 77 + 396 + 312 + 768 = 1633\n\n1633 - 1606 = 27. The calculation holds.\n\nFinal Decision: Offer 1 Ore for 3 Sheep and 1 Wheat.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"offer\": [\n    {\"resource\": \"Ore\", \"quantity\": 1}\n  ],\n  \"request\": [\n    {\"resource\": \"Sheep\", \"quantity\": 3},\n    {\"resource\": \"Wheat\", \"quantity\": 1}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Wheat (5)\n\nI have a significant quantity of Ore and Sheep, and a decent quantity of Wheat. I have fewer Wood and Brick, which are middle-to-high value items.\n\nConsidering past interactions:\n*   My previous offers ([3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood], [1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick], [1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood]) were all rejected. This suggests my offers were not appealing enough for Player 1, or Player 1 had different priorities.\n*   Player 1 rejected all my offers.\n*   Player 1 has made one offer ([1 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood]) which I rejected because the value exchange was not in my favor (1*5 + 3*18 = 59 vs 1*32 + 1*11 = 43. This was a bad trade for me).\n\nMy strategy:\n1.  **Prioritize trading away low-value items (Wheat, Wood) for high-value items (Ore, Brick).**\n2.  **Be cautious about trading away Ore and Brick** unless the return is significantly higher in value. I have a lot of Ore, so I might be willing to trade some if I get good value.\n3.  **Analyze the value exchange of every potential trade.**\n4.  **Offer trades that are clearly beneficial to me.** Even if they might not be optimal for the opponent, I should start with beneficial offers and adjust if constantly rejected.\n5.  **Try to understand Player 1's potential needs.** If they rejected my offers for Brick/Wood, maybe they need those more than I think, or they don't want my Wheat/Sheep/Ore. Or maybe they are trying to get resources cheaply.\n\nLet's re-evaluate what I have vs what I need.\nI have a lot of Ore (25) and Sheep (19). I have relatively less Brick (12) and Wood (7).\nBrick (Value 26) and Ore (Value 32) are my most valuable resources.\nWheat (Value 5) and Wood (Value 11) are my least valuable resources.\n\nMy previous offer of \"1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood\" values Ore at 32 vs 26+11 = 37. This was beneficial for me by 5 value, but rejected. Perhaps too greedy, or Player 1 needed the Ore more, or didn't value Wood that highly.\n\nLet's try to offload some Wheat and/or Wood for something more valuable.\nIf Player 1 rejected an offer of 1 Ore (32) for 1 Brick (26) and 1 Wood (11), maybe they have an abundance of Brick or Wood, or maybe they really want Ore.\n\nI have 15 Wheat (value 5). Let's try to convert some of this low-value resource.\nWhat if I offer 3 Wheat (15 value) for 1 Wood (11 value) and 1 Sheep (18 value)? That's 15 for 29, which is good for me. But Player 1 just offered me 1 Wheat, 3 Sheep for 1 Ore, 1 Wood. This implies Player 1 might want Wheat or Sheep.\nIf Player 1 offered 1W, 3S (5+54 = 59) for 1O, 1W (32+11 = 43), they were trying to gain value from me. This tells me they might be short on Ore or Wood, and have an abundance of Wheat/Sheep. This aligns with me having many Sheep.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 is short on Ore and Brick. I have plenty of Ore. I am short on Brick.\n\nConsider trading away 1 Sheep (value 18) for something better. If I trade 1 Sheep for 1 Wood (11) and 1 Wheat (5), that's 18 for 16, bad for me.\nWhat if I trade 1 Sheep for 1 Brick? (18 for 26). Good for me.\nWhat if I trade 1 Sheep for 2 Wheat? (18 for 10). Bad for me.\n\nPlayer 1 has rejected all my offers. I need to make a more appealing offer for Player 1, but still beneficial to me.\nPlayer 1 might be looking to acquire Ore. I have 25 Ore, so I can afford to trade some if the return is good.\n\nI have 7 Wood. Its value is 11.\nI have 12 Brick. Its value is 26.\nI have 15 Wheat. Its value is 5.\nI have 19 Sheep. Its value is 18.\nI have 25 Ore. Its value is 32.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood. I have low quantity and it's relatively low value.\nOffer: 1 Wood (Value 11). Request: 1 Wheat (Value 5) and 1 Sheep (Value 18). Total 11 for 23. This is good for me. But why would Player 1 accept? They likely have Wheat and Sheep.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 wants Ore.\nIf I give 1 Ore (32), what do I want in return?\nIf I get 1 Brick (26) and 1 Sheep (18): 1 Ore (32) -> 1 Brick (26) + 1 Sheep (18) = 44. This is a gain of 12 for me.\nThis seems like a fair-looking trade for Player 1 too, as they get the highly valuable Ore.\n\nLet's try a small trade to gauge Player 1's interest. Something that doesn't deplete my high-value resources too much but still beneficial.\nI have plenty of Wheat and Sheep. Player 1 seems to have those too.\nI have plenty of Ore. Player 1 seems to want Ore.\nI want Brick and Wood (I have less quantity).\n\nMaybe I can offer a combination of lower value items for a higher value item.\nExample: 3 Wheat (15) and 1 Wood (11) -> 1 Brick (26). Value: 26 for 26. This is neutral. But I'm trading 4 items for 1. From a quantity perspective, this is good for me if I want to consolidate, but bad if Player 1 wants to consolidate. Player 1 might like smaller quantities.\n\nLet's rethink: What if Player 1 wants to get rid of some high value items for some low value items? That seems unlikely.\nIt's more likely Player 1 wants to trade low value for high value, just like me.\n\nI need to make an offer that feels beneficial, or at least not too painful, for Player 1.\nIf I offer 1 Ore, what would I want?\nI currently have 25 Ore. I can afford to trade 1 or 2.\nMy previous offer of 1 Ore for 1 Brick + 1 Wood (32 for 37, gain 5) was rejected. Maybe Player 1 values their Brick and Wood highly, or they don't want Wood.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick. It's my second most valuable resource and I only have 12.\nIf I give 1 Sheep (18) and 1 Wheat (5), total 23. Request 1 Brick (26). Gain 3.\nThis trade is quite small, might be rejected.\n\nWhat if I offer something Player 1 seemingly wants (Ore) along with something common (Wheat/Sheep) for Brick?\nOffer: 1 Wheat (5), 1 Ore (32) -> 2 Brick (52). Total Offer: 37. Total Request: 52. Gain: 15. This is highly beneficial for me. My last offer with 1 Ore and 1 Wheat for 2 Brick was rejected. It had a gain of 15. So, maybe Player 1 doesn't have 2 Brick to give up, or just doesn't want to trade their Brick.\n\nLet's try to trade Sheep, as I have 19 of them.\nOffer: 2 Sheep (36) -> 1 Brick (26), 1 Wood (11). Total requested: 37. Value for me: +1. It's a small gain, and I'm trading 2 items for 2. Seems balanced. Player 1 might accept getting two different resources (Brick and Wood) for a single type.\n\nLet's consider Player 1's last offer again: 1 Wheat (5), 3 Sheep (54) -> 1 Ore (32), 1 Wood (11).\nTotal offered: 59. Total requested: 43. Player 1 wanted *me* to lose 16 value. I rejected it.\nThis confirms Player 1 is also trying to gain value, and they seem to have an abundance of Wheat/Sheep.\nSince they offered Wheat and Sheep for Ore and Wood, they probably want Ore and Wood.\n\nI have ample Ore. I have less Wood.\nMy current Wood = 7. My current Brick = 12.\nMy current Sheep = 19. My current Wheat = 15.\nMy current Ore = 25.\n\nIf Player 1 needs Ore and Wood, I can offer some Ore. I can receive Brick.\nLet's try offering Ore for Brick and something else.\nOffer: 1 Ore (32) -> 1 Brick (26) + 1 Sheep (18). Total Requested = 44. My gain = 12.\nThis is quite good for me, and Player 1 gets an Ore (which they want) and gets rid of Sheep (which they seem to have). They lose a Brick, but gain an Ore. Their total value gain from this trade would be 32 (Ore value gained) + 18 (Sheep value given, so they save 18 in value if they wanted to get rid of it) - 26 (Brick value lost). This assumes they value getting rid of Sheep as a positive.\nIf Player 1 does not value getting rid of Sheep, then it's 32 - 26 = 6 for them. So they gain 6 value and get an Ore. This seems plausible for Player 1.\nI gain 12 value.\n\nWhat if Player 1 is short on Brick? What if they wanted more Brick in past rejections by my side?\nIf I offer 1 Ore (32) for 2 Brick (52), that's a gain of 20 for me. Player 1 would be giving up 2 valuable Brick for 1 valuable Ore. This is bad for Player 1 (-20 value). Unlikely to be accepted.\n\nMy optimal strategy: trade low value (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) for high value (Brick, Ore).\nSince Player 1 seems to want Ore and Wood, I can offer Ore.\nLet's combine this.\nI have a lot of Ore and a lot of Sheep.\nLet's try to trade Sheep for Brick or Wood, since I have quantity of Sheep.\nOffer: 2 Sheep (36) -> 1 Brick (26), 1 Wood (11). Total requested = 37. My gain = 1. Small gain.\nThis trade is low risk for me and might appeal to Player 1 if they need Brick/Wood and have Sheep.\n\nLet's try trading away some of my excess Wheat.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (25) -> 1 Brick (26). My gain = 1. Trading 5 low value for 1 high value. This is good for consolidating resources.\nThis is another low-value gain, but good for consolidating.\n\nLet's try something bolder that leverages my Ore.\nOffer: 1 Ore (32) -> 1 Brick (26), 1 Sheep (18). Value: 32 vs 44. My gain +12. This seems like a reasonable offer for Player 1. They get Ore (which they seem to want) and give me Sheep (which they seem to have). They lose a high value Brick, but if they want to consolidate their resource types, this could work.\n\nLet's stick with the idea that Player 1 wants Ore.\nI'm willing to give up some Ore if I gain significantly.\n1 Ore = 32.\nMy last rejected offer was 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood (32 for 37). Gain 5.\nGiven Player 1's previous offer: 1W, 3S -> 1O, 1W. They offered 59 value to get 43 value. They wanted to make me lose 16 value. This gives me insight into their negotiation style - they are trying to make highly beneficial trades for themselves.\n\nI should make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me, but also looks like it might be beneficial to Player 1 if they desperately need a resource.\nPlayer 1 needs Ore. I have plenty.\nI need Brick. I don't have enough.\n\nLet's try this:\nOffer: 1 Ore + 1 Wheat (32 + 5 = 37) -> 2 Brick (52). My gain = 15. This was rejected before.\nMaybe they don't have 2 Brick. They only offered 1 Ore and 1 Wood in return for 1W, 3S.\n\nLet's try for just 1 Brick.\nOffer: 1 Ore (32) -> 1 Brick (26) + 1 Wood (11). This was previously rejected by Player 1. Value for me: +5.\nWhy was it rejected? Did they have scarcity of Brick/Wood? Or did they not want to part with those given just one Ore?\n\nCould Player 1 be trying to accumulate specific resources for a large build, and thus not want to trade certain ones?\nI will assume Player 1 is holding onto Brick and Wood tightly.\nIf they are holding on to Brick and Wood, they must have them, and value them highly.\nOr maybe they don't have enough of them. The previous rejections could be due to not having the requested resources.\n\nIf Player 1 wants Ore, I can give Ore. What can I get that is high value, and they might want to get rid of? Perhaps Sheep?\nCurrent state:\nPlayer 0: 15 Wheat (5), 7 Wood (11), 19 Sheep (18), 12 Brick (26), 25 Ore (32).\nPlayer 1 Offer: 1 Wheat (5), 3 Sheep (18) -> 1 Ore (32), 1 Wood (11). Value for P1: (32+11) - (5+54) = 43-59 = -16. This was a very bad offer for me, I rejected. This shows P1 wants to acquire Ore and Wood, and is willing to give Wheat and Sheep for it.\n\nSo, Player 1 wants Ore and Wood. I have a lot of Ore. I have less Wood, and I value it more.\nI also have a lot of Sheep and Wheat. Player 1 seems to have a lot of Sheep and Wheat too, or they are happy to trade them.\n\nMy best strategy now is to offer Ore to get something I need more of, especially Brick. And possibly get rid of some excess Sheep.\nIf I offer 1 Ore (32) and get 1 Brick (26) and 1 Wood (11), it's a 32 for 37 trade (+5 for me). Player 1 rejected this. This strongly implies P1 doesn't want to give me Brick AND Wood for one Ore. They likely value them more.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore for just Brick?\nOffer: 1 Ore (32) -> 1 Brick (26) + 1 Sheep (18). Total 44 requested vs 32 offered. My gain = 12. Player 1 gets 1 Ore, gives 1 Brick and 1 Sheep. If they have excess Sheep, this is good for them. Getting 1 Ore and offloading 1 Sheep costs them 1 Brick. Net value change: 32 (Ore)+18 (Sheep out) - 26 (Brick out) = 24.\nSo, Player 1 gains 24 value if they truly have excess Sheep and want to get rid of them. This is an excellent trade for Player 1.\nAnd it's a +12 value gain for me. This seems like a win-win.\n\nLet's offer this: I give 1 Ore, Player 1 gives 1 Brick and 1 Sheep.\nThis implies Player 1 can supply Brick and Sheep, and wants Ore.\nThis is based on Player 1's previous offer: they offered Wheat & Sheep for Ore & Wood. This implies they have excess Wheat & Sheep, and want Ore & Wood.\n\nFinal check on the values:\nMy Offer: 1 Ore (Value 32)\nMy Request: 1 Brick (Value 26), 1 Sheep (Value 18)\nTotal Value Offered by me: 32\nTotal Value Requested by me: 26 + 18 = 44\nMy Net Value Change: +12\n\nPlayer 1's side:\nPlayer 1 receives: 1 Ore (Value 32)\nPlayer 1 gives: 1 Brick (Value 26), 1 Sheep (Value 18)\nPlayer 1's Net Value Change: 32 - (26 + 18) = 32 - 44 = -12 + (if they value getting rid of sheep as positive).\nThis looks like a -12 value loss for player 1, on paper. If I'm trying to make a good deal for them, this is bad.\n\nLet me correct my assumption. Player 1 offered (1W, 3S) for (1O, 1W).\nValue offered by Player 1: 5 + (3*18) = 59\nValue requested by Player 1: 32 + 11 = 43\nPlayer 1's desired value change: 43 - 59 = -16. This means Player 1 wanted *me* to take a negative value change. This is typical of a competitive player.\n\nSo, I should also make an offer where *I* gain value, and *Player 1 loses value*.\nMy previous offer of 1 Ore for 1 Brick, 1 Wood was +5 for me, and -5 for Player 1. This was rejected. My gain was too small, or the items were wrong.\n\nWhat if I offer a resource that I have a ton of (Ore) for something that is valuable and something I have less quantity of.\nI want Brick (26). I also want Wood (11).\nI have 25 Ore. 12 Brick. 7 Wood.\n\nLet's try to trade for Brick and make Player 1 pay for it more.\nOffer: 1 Sheep (18) and 1 Wood (11). Total 29.\nRequest: 1 Brick (26) and 1 Wheat (5). Total 31.\nMy gain: +2. This is very small.\n\nI need to aim for a significant gain (like Player 1 did).\nIf Player 1 wants resources (Ore, Wood), I am the supplier. They should pay for it.\nLet's try giving 1 Ore (32) and getting:\n- 1 Brick (26) and 1 Sheep (18) = 44. Gain 12. P1 loses 12. Rejected before.\n- 2 Brick (52). Gain 20. P1 loses 20. Rejected before.\n\nMaybe Player 1 is just waiting for me to give them a good deal on Ore where they don't give up too much.\nWhat if I offer a balanced trade for Player 1?\nOffer: 1 Ore (32) -> 1 Brick (26) + 1 Wood (11). This is 32 for 37. +5 for me. -5 for Player 1. This was rejected.\n\nThis indicates that Player 1 values Brick and Wood extremely highly, or they don't have them in quantities that allow for trading. Or they just prefer to acquire resources at a discount.\n\nGiven the past rejections by Player 1 of my offers for Brick/Wood, I will assume P1 is less willing to trade away Brick and Wood.\nPlayer 1, however, offered to trade away Wheat and Sheep for Ore and Wood. So they have Wheat and Sheep, and want Ore and Wood.\nI have a ton of Ore. I need to trade something from my Wheat/Sheep/Ore.\n\nMy goal is to increase my value.\nI have 15 Wheat (5). 7 Wood (11). 19 Sheep (18). 12 Brick (26). 25 Ore (32).\n\nLet's try to offload some Wheat and Sheep.\nOffer: 4 Wheat (20) + 2 Sheep (36) = 56.\nRequest: 2 Brick (52) + 1 Wood (11) = 63.\nMy gain: +7. I'm trading 6 low-mid value items for 3 high-value items. This consolidates my resources.\nPlayer 1 loses: -7. But they get rid of Sheep/Wheat which they seem to have in abundance, and I get Brick/Wood which I need.\n\nThis seems like a good offer.\n*   It's a value gain for me.\n*   It consolidates my resources from lower value/high quantity to higher value/lower quantity.\n*   It provides Player 1 with low value resources they seem to desire to offload (Wheat/Sheep), in exchange for higher value resources (Brick/Wood). If Player 1 is building something that requires many low-value resources, this could appeal to them.\n*   Player 1 rejected my previous offers for Brick/Wood. This current offer gives 6 items for 3, which might be appealing if P1 wants to increase their net quantity of items.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. I want to increase total value.\nMy current total value: 2006.\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep (36), 1 Wood (11) -> 2 Brick (52).\nOffered Value: 47. Requested Value: 52. My Gain: +5.\nThis means I give up 2 Sheep and 1 Wood (all of my Wood!). This seems too risky to give up all my Wood.\n\nLet's stick to offering Wheat and Sheep, since P1 seems to have an abundance of them and wants to trade them away.\nI have 15 Wheat, 19 Sheep.\nIf Player 1 wants Ore, I can tempt them with Ore.\nOffer: 1 Ore (32), 1 Wheat (5) -> 2 Brick (52). This was my previous rejected offer. My gain +15. P1 loss -15.\nIt makes sense P1 rejected this, it was heavily in my favor.\n\nI need to make a slightly less greedy offer for Player 1.\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore + some Wheat/Sheep that P1 values less for just one Brick?\nOffer: 1 Ore (32), 2 Wheat (10) -> 1 Brick (26), 1 Wood (11), 1 Sheep (18).\nValue offered: 42. Value requested: 55. My gain: +13. This is still quite good for me.\nPlayer 1 gets Ore, but gives up a lot (Brick, Wood, Sheep). This is unlikely given past rejections.\n\nI need to simplify my offers now and consider Player 1's preferences.\nPlayer 1 offered 1 Wheat, 3 Sheep for 1 Ore, 1 Wood.\nThis means: Player 1 has Wheat and Sheep and wants to get rid of them. Player 1 wants Ore and Wood.\n\nI have: Wheat (15), Wood (7), Sheep (19), Brick (12), Ore (25).\nI will offer what Player 1 wants (Ore, maybe Wood) and try to get what I want (Brick) or offload what I have in quantity (Wheat, Sheep).\n\nLet's try to get more Wood and Brick.\nOffer: 1 Ore (32) and 2 Wheat (10) -> 1 Brick (26) and 2 Wood (22).\nValue offered: 42. Value requested: 48. My gain: +6.\nPlayer 1 gets an Ore (which they want) and gives a Brick and 2 Wood (which they seem to have based on their desire to get Ore and Wood). This is a net gain of 6 for me, and a loss of 6 for P1 if we only consider direct values. But P1 gains an Ore.\n\nThis seems like a balanced offer for both parties given my assumptions. I gain 6 value, Player 1 loses 6 value (on paper), but they get the highly desired Ore. Quantity-wise, I trade 3 items for 3 items.\n\nLet's go with this.\n[Offer: 1 Ore, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 2 Wood]",

This means I want to trade resources I value less for resources I value more, or trade resources in excess for something more valuable.\n\n**Evaluation of potential trades:**\nI calculate the value of items offered and items requested. A trade is profitable if `Value(Requested Items) > Value(Offered Items)`.\n\n**Factors influencing decision-making:**\n1.  **Profitability:** The primary factor.\n2.  **Resource quantity:** I have a good quantity of all resources, especially Wheat, Sheep, and Ore. I might be willing to part with more of my abundant low-value resources (Wheat) or abundant high-value resources (Ore) if the return is good.\n3.  **Opponent's likely needs:** Player 1 accepted my last offer of `1 Ore, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 2 Wood`. This suggests they value Brick and Wood. They might be running low on these or need them for a high-value combination. They previously rejected trades involving Ore for Brick and Wood, but this last one offering Wheat as well worked.\n\n**Previous Trade Analysis:**\nThe last trade was `1 Ore, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 2 Wood`.\n*   Offered Value: (1 * 32) + (2 * 5) = 32 + 10 = 42\n*   Requested Value: (1 * 26) + (2 * 11) = 26 + 22 = 48\n*   Net Gain: 48 - 42 = +6. This was a good trade.\n\nPlayer 1 has accepted a profitable trade for me involving Ore, Wheat, Brick, and Wood. This confirms their interest in Brick and Wood, and that they are willing to trade Ore and Wheat for them.\n\nSince the game has progressed, I should continue to leverage what I know. My Ore is a high-value resource, but I have a lot of it (25). Brick and Wood are valuable, and Player 1 seems to need them. I should try to get more Brick and Wood, especially Brick, as it has a very high value (26). Wood is also good at 11.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep (19) and Wheat (15). While Wheat is low value, Sheep is mid-high at 18.\nI could try another trade similar to the one that was accepted, or adjust it slightly based on values.\n\nLet's consider trading some Ore and a lower value resource (Wheat or Sheep) for Brick and Wood again.\n\n**Possible Offer Ideas:**\n\n1.  **Try to get more Brick and Wood for Ore/Wheat:**\n    *   Offer: 1 `Ore` (32) + 1 `Wheat` (5) = 37\n    *   Request: 1 `Brick` (26) + 1 `Wood` (11) = 37\n        *   This is a zero-sum trade, but helps rebalance my resources if I want more Brick/Wood. Player 1 might accept it as it's balanced. But I want to gain value.\n\n2.  **Make a more profitable trade leveraging my abundant Ore:**\n    *   Offer: 1 `Ore` (32)\n    *   Request: 2 `Brick` (52)\n        *   This is a huge gain for me (+20), but Player 1 previously rejected \"1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood\" which was less for them. So 2 Brick for 1 Ore is probably too aggressive.\n\n3.  **Modify the last successful trade slightly to my advantage:**\n    *   Last successful: `1 Ore (32), 2 Wheat (10) -> 1 Brick (26), 2 Wood (22)` (42 -> 48, gain 6)\n    *   Can I get more Brick?\n        *   Offer: 1 `Ore` (32) + 1 `Wheat` (5) = 37\n        *   Request: 1 `Brick` (26) + 1 `Wood` (11) + 1 `Wheat` (5) = 42\n            *   This is me offering less of my resources for more. Unlikely.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. I have the most Ore. Brick is the most valuable per item to acquire.\nI want to target Brick and Wood.\n\nConsider what Player 1 gained last time: 1 Ore, 2 Wheat. They might want more of that.\nI got 1 Brick, 2 Wood.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of high and low value for high value?\nI have plenty of Sheep, and they are relatively high value.\nI have plenty of Ore.\n\nLet's try to get Brick primarily.\n*   Offer: 1 `Ore` (32) + 1 `Sheep` (18) = 50\n*   Request: 2 `Brick` (52)\n    *   Net gain: +2. This is a small gain, but if Player 1 really needs Brick, they might consider it. However, 2 Brick for high-value items might be difficult.\n\nLet's try something I know they might value more (Ore/Wheat combo), but get more high-value back.\nThe last trade was: `1 Ore, 2 Wheat (total 42) for 1 Brick, 2 Wood (total 48)`.\nI gained 6.\n\nWhat if I offer slightly less but request similar or slightly more value back?\nI have a ton of Ore.\nI have a ton of Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick. My quantity of Brick is reasonable but not as high as others. Brick quantity 12.\nMy quantity of Wood is 7, which is relatively low. I should try to increase Wood.\n\nLet's try an offer that is similar in structure to the successful one, but slightly more tilted in my favor.\nOffer: 1 `Ore` (32) + 1 `Wheat` (5) = 37\nRequest: 1 `Brick` (26) + 2 `Wood` (22) = 48\nValue gain: 48 - 37 = +11. This is a very good gain.\nThis is similar to my last offer, but I'm offering 1 less Wheat while requesting the same high value resources. This might be a bit too greedy.\n\nLet's try to stick to making small, consistent gains.\nPlayer 1 seemed to value Wood. And they accepted a trade involving Ore and Wheat.\n\nHow about I offer my abundant `Sheep`?\n`Sheep` is 18.\nIf I offer: 2 `Sheep` (36)\nAnd request: 1 `Brick` (26) + 1 `Wood` (11) = 37\nNet gain = +1. Could work. Player 1 might need Sheep, but if they accept they are losing value. This is a slightly positive sum trade for me.\n\nLet's consider an offer that is perceived as fair, but still a gain for me.\nThe previous trade `1 Ore (32), 2 Wheat (10) -> 1 Brick (26), 2 Wood (22)` (total 42 -> 48).\nThey gave me 1 Brick and 2 Wood.\nI gave them 1 Ore and 2 Wheat.\n\nWhat if I try to get more Wood, and perhaps more Brick given I have reasonable quantities of Ore and Sheep.\nLet's try to get 2 `Wood` (22) for 1 `Sheep` (18) + 1 `Wheat` (5) = 23.\nNet value: 22 - 23 = -1. This is a loss. Not good.\n\nLet's look at relative values.\nOre (32) > Brick (26) > Sheep (18) > Wood (11) > Wheat (5)\n\nI want to trade low value for high value, or excess for needed.\nI have a lot of Ore (25).\nI have a lot of Sheep (19).\nI have a lot of Wheat (15).\n\nMy strategy should be to get more Brick (26) and potentially more Wood (11) as my Wood quantity is lowest.\n\nLet's try to get 1 `Brick` (26) and 1 `Wood` (11) together. Total needed: 37.\nWhat can I give for 37 value or less?\n1 `Ore` (32) + 1 `Wheat` (5) = 37. (Neutral)\nPerhaps I adjust the quantities slightly to achieve a small win.\n\nConsider:\nOffer: 1 `Ore` (32)\nRequest: 1 `Brick` (26) + 1 `Wood` (11) + 1 `Wheat` (5) = 42\nNet: +10. This is aggressive.\n\nPlayer 1 has rejected several offers from me unless they are very specific. The most recent accept was 1 Ore, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 2 Wood.\nThis suggests they really want `Ore` and `Wheat`.\nI have plenty of `Ore` and `Wheat`. So I can continue to offer these.\nI want `Brick` and `Wood`.\n\nLet's try to get more `Brick` primarily, as it's the highest value I'm targeting.\nOffer: 2 `Ore` (64)\nRequest: 3 `Brick` (78)\nNet gain: +14. This might be too much Ore to offer.\n\nLet's make a modest offer that is a good gain for me and seems fair.\nOffer 1 `Ore` (32) + 1 `Sheep` (18) = 50\nRequest 2 `Brick` (52)\nNet gain: +2. This is small, but good per item. I have plenty of Ore and Sheep. Brick is very valuable.\n\nThe last accepted trade was `1 Ore, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 2 Wood`.\nValue out: 32 + 10 = 42.\nValue in: 26 + 22 = 48.\nGain: 6.\n\nLet's try to replicate the setup slightly but get a bit more for less.\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore (32) and only 1 Wheat (5)? Total 37.\nAnd request 1 Brick (26) and 2 Wood (22)? Total 48.\nGain: 11. This is substantial.\nPlayer 1 might see me lowering my wheat offering as a reason to reject, but the total values are still favorable to them (they get 1 Ore and 1 Wheat for 1 Brick and 2 Wood). I also need to ensure I don't give away too much of my high-value items, but Ore is abundant.\n\nLet's try this offer:\n`[Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 2 Wood]`\n\nThinking about Player 1: They accepted the previous offer implying they need/value Brick and Wood. They are willing to give these up for Ore and Wheat.\nI am offering them exactly what they accepted, less one Wheat, but requesting the same back. This might seem like I'm trying to rip them off, OR they might still find the Ore + Wheat combination valuable enough.\n\nLet's consider a slightly safer approach, while still gaining value.\nTarget: Brick and Wood.\nWhat if I try to get a better quantity of Wood, which is my lowest quantity resource aside from Brick.\n\nCurrent Wood: 7. Brick: 12.\nI want more Wood.\nOffer: 1 `Ore` (32) + 1 `Wheat` (5) = 37\nRequest: 1 `Brick` (26) + 1 `Wood` (11) = 37. This is a neutral trade that improves my Wood count slightly. Not what I want.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 `Ore` (32) for 1 `Brick` (26) and 1 `Wood` (11)? Total 37. Loss of 5 for me.\n\nMy focus should be to get resources that are high value or I have low quantity of (Wood, Brick).\nI have a ton of Ore and Sheep.\n\nLet's try to use my Sheep.\nOffer: 2 `Sheep` (36)\nRequest: 1 `Brick` (26) + 1 `Wood` (11) = 37.\nNet: +1. It's a gain, and uses my excess Sheep. This might appeal to Player 1 if they need Sheep.\n\nThe last successful trade was `1 Ore, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 2 Wood`. I should probably stick to similar types of offers as Player 1 has shown a willingness to accept them.\nI might be able to offer less of my cheaper resource (Wheat) for the same valuable resources.\n\nConsider again:\nOffer: 1 `Ore` (32) + 1 `Wheat` (5) = 37\nRequest: 1 `Brick` (26) + 2 `Wood` (22) = 48\nNet: +11. This is a very good gain for me. Will Player 1 accept? They were willing to give up 1 Brick and 2 Wood for 1 Ore and 2 Wheat. Now they'd get 1 Ore and 1 Wheat. If their need for Ore is high, they might accept this lower quantity of Wheat. If they just needed the quantities, they might not.\n\nLet's try to increase my Wood count specifically, as it's the lowest.\nOffer: 1 `Wheat` (5) + 1 `Sheep` (18) = 23\nRequest: 2 `Wood` (22) + 1 `Wheat` (5) = 27\nNet: +4. This gets me more wood and keeps a Wheat for them.\nOr just:\nOffer: 1 `Wheat` (5) + 1 `Sheep` (18) = 23\nRequest: 2 `Wood` (22)\nNet: -1. No.\n\nLet's try to leverage an obvious need for Player 1 (Ore for Brick/Wood).\nMy most successful trade was 1 Ore, 2 Wheat for 1 Brick, 2 Wood.\nI will try to make a trade slightly more favorable to me, maintaining a good offer structure.\n\nSince my Wood quantity is lowest, let me target that without completely losing value.\nOffer: 1 `Ore` (32)\nRequest: 1 `Brick` (26) + 1 `Wood` (11) = 37\n*   My gain: +5.\n*   Player 1's perspective: Giving up 1 Brick and 1 Wood for 1 Ore. It's close to balanced.\n\nThis seems like a fair-ish trade, and allows me to consolidate value. My quantity of Ore is 25, so giving up 1 is fine.\nMy quantity of Brick is 12, so gaining 1 is good (to 13).\nMy quantity of Wood is 7, so gaining 1 is good (to 8).\n\nThis is a good, low-risk attempt to convert high-quantity Ore into needed Brick/Wood.\n\nFinal check:\nOffer: 1 `Ore` (32)\nRequest: 1 `Brick` (26) + 1 `Wood` (11)\nValue offered: 32\nValue requested: 37\nNet gain: +5. This is a profitable trade.\n\nIt makes sense to try this, as Player 1 accepted a trade where they gave me 1 Brick and 2 Wood in exchange for higher total value. So they obviously value Ore. If I just give them Ore for Brick and Wood, it might appeal to them.\nMy quantities: Wheat 15, Wood 7, Sheep 19, Brick 12, Ore 25.\nAfter trade: Wheat 15, Wood 8, Sheep 19, Brick 13, Ore 24.\nThis improves my Wood and Brick quantities while reducing my abundant Ore.\n\nLet's try this.\n\n```\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood]\n```",
