Sheep is my most abundant card (21 units); I can spare a few without seriously affecting its marginal value, and selling a Sheep is \u201cworth\u201d 13 points each to me.\n2. Brick is my scarcest physical resource (only 8). I have almost zero play-ability risk of losing value, so every extra Brick I gain should stay valuable.\n3. Ore is my single **highest-value** card (32 \u00d711 = 352). The marginal utility hurts a lot if I trade any away unless I get massive compensation, so I\u2019d rather keep it.\n4. Wheat/Wood are relatively minor to me (20 % of value pooled together). Trading them is less painful than the value-dense Ore or Brick, but they\u2019re only at 6/9 points each so they aren\u2019t tempting fare for my opponent either.\n\nConcept of a favorable trade\n- Any trade must increase my total value (\u2265 +1 point after the exchange).\n- Sending low-value extra resources (a Sheep or two) and receiving high-value scarce ones (mostly Brick, secondarily Ore) is the easiest way to guarantee surplus.\n- Aim to give 1 or 2 Sheep plus perhaps 1 Wheat or Wood total, and get back 2\u20133 Brick.\n\nConcrete offer construction\nGive: low-value surplus 2 Sheep and maybe 1 Wheat \u2192 net cost 2\u00d713 + 6 = 32 points  \nGet: scarce high-value 3 or 4 Brick \u2192 net gain 3\u00d728 = 84 or 4\u00d728 = 112\n\nThat yields value-delta \u2248 +40 to +80 points: clearly profitable.\n\nI propose the most balanced/simple version first to test the waters:  \n2 Sheep + 1 Wheat for 3 Brick.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 3 Brick]",

      "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Current Situation and Goals**:  \n   - I have the following resources:  \n     - Wheat: 17 (value 5 each, total value 85)  \n     - Wood: 22 (value 9 each, total value 198)  \n     - Sheep: 15 (value 16 each, total value 240)  \n     - Brick: 10 (value 28 each, total value 280)  \n     - Ore: 12 (value 39 each, total value 468)  \n   - Total current value: 1,271.  \n   - My goal is to increase this total value through trading. Resources are not equally valuable to me; Ore (39) and Brick (28) are high-value, while Wheat (5) and Wood (9) are low-value, and Sheep (16) is medium-value.  \n\n2. **Evaluation of Player 0's Offer**:  \n   - Player 0 offered: 4 Wheat (4 \u00d7 5 = 20 value to me), 1 Wood (1 \u00d7 9 = 9 value), and 1 Sheep (1 \u00d7 16 = 16 value), for a total offered value of 45.  \n   - Player 0 requested 2 Brick (2 \u00d7 28 = 56 value to me).  \n   - Net value change if I accept: Gain 45, lose 56, resulting in a net loss of 11 value. This decreases my total value, which contradicts my goal. Therefore, I must reject this offer.  \n\n3. **Trade Evaluation and Decision Factors**:  \n   - Key principle: I aim for trades where the value received exceeds the value given (net positive gain).  \n   - Player 0 has consistently requested Brick in past offers, suggesting high demand or need for Brick from their perspective. This creates an opportunity to negotiate favorable deals.  \n   - My low-value resources (Wheat and Wood) are abundant, so I should prioritize trading them away for higher-value items. However, in this context, Brick is also valuable to me (28), so I must demand a premium when trading it.  \n   - Sheep (16) has medium value and is frequently part of Player 0's offers, indicating they may have excess or value it less. Acquiring more Sheep could be acceptable if it yields a net gain, especially since it can be bundled in future trades.  \n   - Ideal targets: I should focus on acquiring Ore (39) or more Brick (28) to maximize value, but Ore may be harder to obtain. Given Player 0's behavior, Sheep might be easier.  \n   - For a counter-offer: I propose trading Brick (since Player 0 wants it) for Sheep to ensure a net gain. Specifically:  \n     - Offer 2 Brick (cost: 56 value) for 4 Sheep (gain: 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 value).  \n     - Net gain: 64 - 56 = +8 value, improving my position.  \n   - Risk: Player 0 may reject, as past offers from me were rejected. However, with only 10 Brick available, trading 2 keeps me at 8, which is reasonable for now.  \n\n4. **Opponent's Perspective**:  \n   - Player 0 appears to highly value Brick (based on repeated requests for it). They might have a surplus of Sheep, Wheat, and Wood, which they offer at low value to me.  \n   - Their rejected offers are improving (e.g., from -21 net loss in offer 2 to -11 in this one), showing price sensitivity. I can counter with a strong ask for Sheep to test their valuation.  \n   - They may be accumulating Brick for a game objective, so exploiting this need could yield good trades.  \n\n5. **Overall Decision**: Reject the current offer and propose a counter-offer that ensures a clear value increase for me.  \n   - Accepted: -11 value is unacceptable.  \n   - Counter-offer: 2 Brick for 4 Sheep (+8 net gain).  \n\n**Action**:\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 4 Sheep]",

Player 1 keeps rejecting my offers where I give Sheep and Wheat/Wood for Brick\u2013they clearly price Brick higher than 2\u20133 units of my low/mid-value cards.  \n\nHow my opponent values resources (after their last offer):\n- They just offered **2 Brick for 4 Sheep** (112 value for vs 52 value against).  \n- That implies they value **Brick \u2248 2 Sheep**.  2\u00bd Brick : 5 Sheep roughly \u2013 meaning Brick \u2248 26 per unit in their eyes (rather below the 32 my valuation places Ore, but above the 4 per Wheat).  \n\nGoal:\nIncrease total value quickly. Identify the cheapest high-value resources for me and focus on the one that maximizes gain per given low-value cards. Ore is highest value for me. Brick is second highest.\n\n\u53ef\u662f\u4f60\u624b\u91cc\u5df2\u7ecf\u670911 Ore \u548c 8 Brick, \u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u73a9\u5bb6\u624b\u91cc Ore \u7d27\u4fcf\u3002\u6211\u73b0\u5728\u8fc7\u5269\u4f4e\u4ef7\u4f4d\u8d44\u6e90 (Wheat, Wood) \u548c\u5927\u91cf Sheep\u3002  \n\nPredicting Player 1\u2019s likely position\n- Player 1 lacks Sheep (they keep turning down deals with Sheep outflow).  \n- They may have excess Brick.  \n\nStrategy\nBuy high-value Brick (or Ore) for my low-value overflow (Wheat, Wood, excess Sheep wherever possible).  \n\nLet me scan how much value I\u2019d give up to get one Brick at two different price points implied by our offers:\n\n- In Player 1\u2019s last offer: 4 Sheep for 2 Brick \u2192 52 vs 56; that is 26 per Brick.  \n- In my last rejected offer: 4 Wheat + 1 Wood + 1 Sheep for 2 Brick \u2192 value me 76 vs 56; ~38 per Brick.\n\nSo Player 1 seemingly values Brick \u2248 26; I\u2019m willing to go up to ~35 in low-value cards per Brick to net gain.  \n\nLet\u2019s test an aggressive sweet-spot that gives them 3 Sheep for 1 Brick, which is 39 vs 28 \u2013 still profitable for me (Strip a surplus high-sheep count while grabbing high-value), and they get Sheep they seem to crave.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",
