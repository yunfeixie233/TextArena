      "response": "To approach this task, let's first analyze my current situation and goals.\n\n### Current Situation and Goals\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 5 units, Value = 6\n   - Wood: 16 units, Value = 9\n   - Sheep: 14 units, Value = 15\n   - Brick: 18 units, Value = 21\n   - Ore: 6 units, Value = 37\n\n2. **Total Value:** Let's calculate the total value of the resources I currently have.\n   - Total Value = (5 * 6) + (16 * 9) + (14 * 15) + (18 * 21) + (6 * 37)\n   - Total Value = 30 + 144 + 210 + 378 + 222\n   - Total Value = 984\n\n3. **Goals:** My goal is to increase the total value of my resources through trading.\n\n### Evaluating Potential Trades or Offers\n\nTo increase the total value, I need to acquire resources that are more valuable or get a better quantity of resources. Let's analyze the value of each resource:\n- The values are already given, with Ore being the most valuable per unit, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\n### Factors Influencing Decision-Making\n\n1. **Resource Value:** I will prioritize trades that give me resources with higher values.\n2. **Quantity:** The quantity of resources being traded will also be a factor, as more resources (even of lower value) can sometimes be beneficial.\n3. **Opponents' Needs:** Understanding what my opponent might need or be looking for can help me make an offer that is mutually beneficial.\n\n### Initial Thought Process\n\nGiven the current distribution of resources, let's consider potential trades.\n\n1. **Identify Less Valuable Resources:** Wheat (Value = 6) and Wood (Value = 9) are relatively less valuable compared to Sheep (Value = 15), Brick (Value = 21), and Ore (Value = 37).\n   \n2. **Potential Trades:** I can consider offering Wheat or Wood for more valuable resources.\n\n### Decision-Making\n\nLet's make an offer that could potentially increase my total value. Since Wheat is the least valuable resource, I'll consider offering it.\n\n- I have 5 Wheat. Let's offer 3 Wheat for something more valuable. \n- A potential trade could be offering 3 Wheat for 1 Sheep or another resource of higher value. However, 1 Sheep is valued at 15, and 3 Wheat are valued at 18 (3*6), so it's not beneficial.\n\nLet's consider another option:\n- Offering Wood for a more valuable resource. I have 16 Wood.\n\nLet's think about a reasonable trade:\n- 4 Wood (Value = 36) could be traded for 1 Ore (Value = 37), which is almost a fair trade in terms of value, but slightly beneficial for the opponent.\n\nLet's formulate an offer:\n- '[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis offer is somewhat fair and might be acceptable to the opponent since they're getting 4 Wood (Value = 36) for 1 Ore (Value = 37), a slight gain for them but it's a reasonable starting point.\n\n### Action\n\nI'll make the following offer:\n'[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]'\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.\n\nSince I'm Player0, I'll make the first move. The turn has just begun.\n\n### The Final Decision for This Turn\n'[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]'",

This means they are losing value (48-36 = 12).\n    *   *Why would they make this offer if it's a net loss for them?* Perhaps they have an abundance of Wood, or they desperately need Ore for a build project. Or they miscalculated. Or they are hoping I only look at the quantity (4 for 1).\n    *   Given that it's a net *gain* for me, I should consider accepting or trying to get an even better deal.\n\n5.  **Decision-Making Strategy:**\n    *   The offer is positive for me. I should either accept it or try to improve it further.\n    *   Since it's the first turn and I don't know Player 0's strategy, accepting a *positive* offer is a safe play. It builds a cooperative foundation (or at least, doesn't immediately signal extreme greed) and guarantees a value increase.\n    *   I have a lot of Sheep (16) and Brick (19). These are mid-to-high value resources for me. While Wood is lower value per unit than Ore, gaining 4 Wood for 1 Ore is a net positive.\n    *   I don't have an immediate *need* for more Wood, but gaining value is the primary goal.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:**\n    The offer is favorable to me in terms of value. I will accept it.\n\n[Accept]",

Value = 3 * 12 = 36\n*   **Requested:** 1 Ore. Value = 1 * 36 = 36\n\nThis offer is value-neutral. It doesn't increase my total resource value.\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Accepting a value-neutral trade does not help me achieve this goal unless I have a strategic reason to change resource composition (e.g., I'm close to building something that requires Ore and have an excess of Wood). Currently, I have a good quantity of Wood (11) and a good quantity of Ore (13). I don't see an immediate strategic advantage in this particular exchange.\n\nTherefore, I will deny this offer and propose one that is beneficial to me.\n\nI want to acquire more high-value resources like Brick or Ore, or exchange low-value resources for high-value ones in a favorable ratio.\nMy highest value resource is Ore (36), followed by Brick (30), Sheep (17), Wood (12), and Wheat (6).\n\nI have a relatively high quantity of Sheep (16) and Brick (19).\nLet's consider offering a lower-value resource for a higher-value one.\n\nHow about offering Wheat (value 6) or Wood (value 12) for something more valuable?\nI could try to get some Ore.\nIf I offer Wheat: 6 * X > 36 (for 1 Ore) -> X > 6. So offering 7 Wheat for 1 Ore would be good. That seems like a lot of Wheat.\nIf I offer Wood: 12 * X > 36 (for 1 Ore) -> X > 3. So 4 Wood for 1 Ore would be good for me. Player 0 previously offered 4 Wood for 1 Ore (which I accepted as it was value neutral), then 3 Wood for 1 Ore (which I'm about to deny). This suggests they might be willing to give up Ore for Wood, though they want it cheap now.\n\nLet's look at Brick. I have 19 Brick. It's high value. Maybe I can trade some of it for Ore.\nIf I offer Brick for Ore: Offered 1 Brick (value 30) for 1 Ore (value 36). This is bad for me. It means I'd need to offer 2 Brick (60) for 1 Ore (36), which is very bad for me. Or offer 1 Brick and something else for 1 Ore.\n\nLet's consider offering Sheep. I have 16 Sheep (value 17).\nIf I offer Sheep for Ore: Offered X Sheep (17X) for 1 Ore (36). 17 * 2 = 34. So 2 Sheep for 1 Ore is bad for me. 3 Sheep (51) for 1 Ore (36) is also bad for me.\n\nIt seems I should focus on leveraging my quantity of lower-value items (Wheat, Wood) to gain higher-value items.\n\nPlayer 0 just tried to get 1 Ore from me for 3 Wood. This implies they want Ore and are willing to give Wood.\nThey have valued 1 Ore at less than 3 Wood (3*12=36, 1*36=36, so they offered equal value, thinking it was beneficial perhaps, or hoping I needed wood).\nI can try to reverse this: offer them less valuable resources for their Ore.\n\nGiven Player 0's previous offer, they must have some Ore or a need for Wood.\nLet's try to get Ore from them using Wood, but in a way that benefits me.\nIf I offer 3 Wood, I get 1 Ore. That's neutral. I don't want neutral.\nIf I offer 2 Wood (value 24) for 1 Ore (value 36), it's good for me. But they just offered me only 3 Wood for 1 Ore. They might not accept 2 Wood.\n\nWhat about Sheep? I have a lot of Sheep.\nIf I offer Sheep for Ore: 2 Sheep (34) for 1 Ore (36). This is very close to neutral, still slightly negative for me.\nWhat if I offer a mix of lower-value resources for a high-value one?\n\nLet's consider my largest quantity: Brick (19) and Sheep (16).\nPerhaps I can get some Wheat from Player 0, as Wheat is my lowest quantity and lowest value. This doesn't increase my *total* value directly, but might give me more flexibility if I can then turn Wheat into something more valuable. However, my primary goal is increasing total value.\n\nLet's go back to Player 0 wanting Ore for Wood. They offered 3 Wood for 1 Ore. This is equal value.\nI want to increase my value. So I need to offer them less value than I receive.\nI have a lot of Sheep (16).\nIf I offer them 2 Sheep (Value 34) for 1 Ore (Value 36), that's good for me. But they might find it too close for them.\nOkay, let's try to get more Ore. Ore is the most valuable resource I have.\n\nHow about offering them a combination of lower-value resources for a high-value one?\nFor example, 1 Wood (12) + 1 Sheep (17) = 29. Too low for 1 Ore (36).\n2 Wood (24) + 1 Sheep (17) = 41. This is over 1 Ore. So 2 Wood + 1 Sheep for 1 Ore would be bad for me.\n\nLet's try to exploit their apparent desire for Ore.\nI have 13 Ore. That's a decent amount. I'm not desperate to get rid of it.\nI have 11 Wood. I can spare some.\nI have 8 Wheat. I value this low and have few of them. It might be useful to get more of them so I can trade a larger quantity for something valuable.\n\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (value 51) for 1 Brick (value 30) - bad for me.\nHow about offering them Brick for Ore? Not good.\nHow about getting rid of some low-value resources?\n\nI will deny the current offer of 3 Wood for 1 Ore as it is value neutral.\nI will make an offer for something that clearly benefits me in terms of total value.\nMy current total value is 1490.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again.\nWhat if I offer some Wood and some Sheep?\nI want to gain more than I lose.\nIf I offer 1 Wood (12) + 1 Wheat (6) = 18. This is too low for anything.\n\nLet's focus on a simple exchange.\nI want Ore.\nI will offer something whose value is less than 36.\nPlayer 0 just offered 3 Wood for 1 Ore.\nIf I offer them 2 Sheep (value 34) for 1 Ore (value 36), I gain 2 value. This is a very small gain, but still a gain.\nGiven I have 16 Sheep, I can afford to part with 2.\n\nThis feels like a reasonable starting offer:\nI will deny their offer.\nMy counter-offer: 2 Sheep for 1 Ore.\n\nReasoning:\n1.  **Deny current offer:** Player 0's offer (3 Wood for 1 Ore) is value-neutral (3*12 = 36, 1*36 = 36). My goal is to increase my *total* resource value, so a neutral trade is not helpful unless there's a specific strategic reason, which there isn't here.\n2.  **Identify target resource:** Ore is my highest value resource (36), and having more of it increases my total value significantly.\n3.  **Identify resource to offer:** I have a good quantity of Sheep (16), which has a moderate value (17). I can spare 2 Sheep.\n4.  **Calculate proposed trade value:**\n    *   Resources offered: 2 Sheep. Value = 2 * 17 = 34.\n    *   Resources requested: 1 Ore. Value = 1 * 36 = 36.\n5.  **Evaluate gain:** If accepted, I gain 2 in total value (36 - 34 = 2). This is a small but positive gain, aligning with my goal. Also, considering Player 0 just tried to acquire Ore, they might be willing to part with it for something that's close in value from their perspective (e.g., if they need Sheep for something).\n\nI will deny their offer first.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"Deny\"\n}\n```\nI will then make my own offer.\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"Offer\",\n  \"offered_resources\": [\n    {\"resource\": \"Sheep\", \"quantity\": 2}\n  ],\n  \"requested_resources\": [\n    {\"resource\": \"Ore\", \"quantity\": 1}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Perhaps we can offer something else for Ore or look for other valuable trades.\n- We could try to offer Sheep or Brick for Ore since they are more valuable than Wood.\n\nLet's consider a new offer:\n- We could offer 2 Sheep (Value: 2*15 = 30) for 1 Ore (Value: 37). The net gain would be 7 (37 - 30), which is a positive gain.\n\nThus, a potential offer is: '[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nLet's calculate the outcome of this potential trade:\n- Sheep: 14 - 2 = 12\n- Ore: 7 + 1 = 8\n\nNew total value = (5*6) + (12*9) + (12*15) + (18*21) + (8*37) = 30 + 108 + 180 + 378 + 296 = 992\n\nThis trade increases the total value.\n\nThe decision is to make the offer: '[Offer: 2 Sheep, 0 Ore -> 0 Sheep, 1 Ore]' is simplified to '[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThe action is: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

It offers no increase in my total value.\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Accepting this offer does not help me achieve that.\n\nPrevious Turn Analysis:\n- I accepted 4 Wood for 1 Ore (Value gained: (1*36) - (4*12) = 36 - 48 = -12). This was a bad trade from a pure value perspective, but perhaps I needed Ore for some other strategy (e.g., building, or I undervalued Wood). This suggests I should be more careful with future accepts.\n- I rejected 3 Wood for 1 Ore (Value gained: (1*36) - (3*12) = 36 - 36 = 0). This was a neutral trade, so rejection was reasonable if I'm looking for gain.\n- I accepted 2 Sheep for 1 Ore (Value gained: (1*36) - (2*17) = 36 - 34 = +2). This was a good trade for me, gaining 2 value.\n\nGiven my goal is to increase total value, I generally want to only accept trades where (Value of Requested Items) > (Value of Offered Items).\nIn the current offer: 3 Wood (Value 36) -> 1 Ore (Value 36).\nThis trade provides zero value gain. I should reject it unless I have a strategic need for Wood over Ore that isn't reflected in the current value. Currently, Ore is my highest value per unit resource, and I generally want to accumulate it or trade it for even more high-value items. I have 13 Ore, which is a significant amount. My Wood quantity is 11.\n\nI should reject this offer. I will also make my own counter-offer. I have quite a bit of Sheep (16) and Brick (19), which are generally lower value per unit than Ore. I'm looking to trade up. I have a lot of Sheep and Brick, perhaps I can trade some of that for Ore or Wheat which I have less of (quantity wise) and is higher value than Sheep. Wood is also less valuable than Ore.\n\nMy strategy will be to offer resources I have in abundance (Sheep, Brick, Wood) for resources that are high value (Ore, or even Wheat if the ratio is good).\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nI have plenty of Wood (11). Ore is 36, Wood is 12. So 3 Wood is 36. That is what Player 0 offered. I could offer 2 Wood for 1 Ore to gain 12 value, but that is unlikely to be accepted.\nWhat about Sheep? 2 Sheep for 1 Ore was accepted before (34 vs 36, +2 value for me). What about more?\n3 Sheep is 51 value. 1 Ore is 36. That's a bad trade for me.\n\nPerhaps I can offer a combination of lower value items for a higher value item.\nI have a lot of Brick. Brick is 30. Ore is 36.\n1 Brick for 1 Ore is 30 vs 36 (+6 value for me), but unlikely to be accepted.\n\nMy current resource values:\nWheat: 6\nWood: 12\nSheep: 17\nBrick: 30\nOre: 36\n\nI have 8 Wheat, 11 Wood, 16 Sheep, 19 Brick, 13 Ore.\n\nI have a large quantity of Sheep and Brick.\nLet's try to trade Brick for Ore or Wheat.\nPlayer 0 keeps offering Wood for Ore. This suggests Player 0 wants Ore.\n\nConsider offering:\n1 Brick (30) + 1 Wood (12) = 42 for 1 Ore (36) + 1 Sheep (17) = 53? No.\n\nLet's stick to simple offers where I gain value.\nI have a lot of Brick (19) and Sheep (16).\nOffering 1 Brick for 2 Wood would be: I give 30, get 24. Bad.\nOffering 1 Brick for 1 Wood and 1 Sheep: 30 vs (12+17)=29. Bad.\n\nWhat if I ask for something cheaper for my high-value items?\nI have 13 Ore. If I sell 1 Ore for 3 Sheep: 36 vs 51. I lose value.\nI should not sell my high-value items unless I get much more value in return.\n\nLet's try selling what I have lots of for what I need.\nI have 19 Brick and 16 Sheep.\nI could offer 2 Brick (60) for 1 Ore (36) + 1 Wheat (6) = 42. I lose a lot. No.\nHow about 2 Brick for 1 Ore? Value: 60 vs 36. This is a very bad trade for me.\n\nThe previous trade where I gained value was: 2 Sheep offered -> 1 Ore requested (34 -> 36, +2 value).\nI could try this again. I have 16 Sheep. I could make that offer.\n\nLet's try to aim for at least 5 value gain.\nTo get 1 Ore (36), I could offer:\n- 2 Sheep (34) -> 1 Ore (36). +2 value. Accepted last time.\nCan I improve this?\n- 1 Brick (30) for 1 Ore (36). +6 value. Aggressive.\n- 1 Wood (12) + 1 Sheep (17) = 29 for 1 Ore (36). +7 value. Aggressive.\n- 2 Wood (24) for 1 Ore (36). +12 value. Very aggressive.\n\nI need to balance aggressiveness with likely acceptance.\nThe 2 Sheep for 1 Ore was accepted. It's a small gain.\nThe opponent is offering 3 Wood for 1 Ore (36 vs 36). They clearly want Ore.\nSo they value Ore highly. My current offer should reflect that.\n\nI will reject their current offer of 3 Wood for 1 Ore, as it gives me no value.\nI will make an offer that gives me value for my abundant resources.\nLet's try to get more Ore, given the opponent's desire for it, and the fact that I got some for a good price last turn.\n\nMy goal: Increase total value.\nI will offer 1 Brick (value 30) for 1 Ore (value 36). This is a +6 value gain for me.\nIt's a gain of 6 for me, and a loss of 6 for them. But sometimes people accept slight losses if they need the resource. They seem to want Ore.\nLet's make this offer. If it's too aggressive, I can adjust in the next turn.\n\nMy current resources:\nWheat: 8 (48)\nWood: 11 (132)\nSheep: 16 (272)\nBrick: 19 (570)\nOre: 13 (468)\nTotal Value: 1490\n\nOffer: 1 Brick (out: 30) -> 1 Ore (in: 36)\nNet value gain for me: +6.\n\nStep-by-step decision:\n1. Analyze Player 0's offer: 3 Wood for 1 Ore. Both sides are valued at 36. No value gain for me.\n2. Goal: Increase total resource value.\n3. Decision on Player 0's offer: Reject, as it doesn't meet my goal.\n4. Consider my counter-offer: Identify abundant resources (Brick, Sheep, Wood) and high-value resources I want (Ore, potentially Wheat).\n5. Previous success: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore (+2 value). Player 0 seems to want Ore.\n6. Propose a more ambitious trade: What if I offer 1 Brick (30) for 1 Ore (36)?\n7. Evaluate my proposed offer: This gives me a +6 value gain. It's an attractive trade for me. It's a small loss for Player 0 but if they really want Ore, they might accept.\n\nI'm rejecting the current offer and making a new one to try and get more value.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",

I should leverage this. I have a good amount of Brick and Ore. My Wheat is my lowest value resource. My Wood is also relatively low value.\n\nI want to continue trading up in value. I would ideally like to trade Wheat or Wood for something more valuable. However, Player 0 has only shown interest in Ore.\n\nWhat could I offer that would still be a net gain for me?\nIf Player 0 wants Ore badly, they might be willing to pay a premium.\nI could try to trade some of my less valuable resources for Ore, but Player 0 seems to be the one trying to get Ore FROM me.\n\nThe last trade was 1 Brick -> 1 Ore. My value increased by 6.\nI have a lot of Brick.\nIf I offer something less valuable per unit than Ore, for Ore, that would be ideal.\n\nLet's look at my lowest value items:\n- Wheat (6)\n- Wood (12)\n- Sheep (17)\n\nConsider what Player 0 might need or value more than me. Their offers suggest they need Ore.\nPerhaps I can trade some Wood or Sheep for something else that is valuable to me, or for Ore if they are willing to overpay.\n\nPlayer 0 has previously offered:\n- 4 Wood for 1 Ore (accepted, value 48 for 36 - good for them, bad for me in hindsight, but it was earlier)\n- 3 Wood for 1 Ore (rejected, value 36 for 36 - neutral)\n- 2 Sheep for 1 Ore (accepted, value 34 for 36 - good for me)\n\nThey seem to be willing to give up Wood and Sheep. I have plenty of both.\nMy best strategy is to keep trading my resources for Ore, specifically resources that are worth less than Ore.\n\nI just gained 6 value by trading 1 Brick for 1 Ore. I still have 18 Brick.\nWhat about offering a larger package of less valuable items for Ore?\nOr continuing to offer Brick for Ore, since that worked?\n\nLet's calculate the value of potential offers for 1 Ore (Value 36):\n- 6 Wheat (6*6 = 36) - Value neutral. I have a lot of Wheat, could be good.\n- 3 Wood (3*12 = 36) - Value neutral. I have a lot of Wood.\n- 2 Sheep (2*17 = 34) - Value gain for me (2). Player 0 has accepted this before.\n\nConsidering Player 0's past offers, they are clearly valuing Ore at a premium, as they've offered 3 Wood (36 value) and even 4 Wood (48 value) for 1 Ore (36 value). This means they are willing to take a loss in value to get Ore.\n\nI should try to exploit this. I want to give them something they value less than Ore, for Ore.\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore (Value 34 -> 36, I gain 2) - This was accepted before.\nOffer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore (Value 36 -> 36, neutral) - This was rejected by me before, maybe they will accept it if I offer it? No, they offered it.\nOffer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore (Value 30 -> 36, I gain 6) - Accepted last turn, so it's a strong candidate.\n\nSince the 1 Brick for 1 Ore trade was accepted last turn, it's a good bet Player 0 might accept it again, especially if they are heavily focused on acquiring Ore. It's a clear win for me in terms of value.\n\nI need to decide what to offer.\nOption A: Repeat the successful trade: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore. (My value gain: +6)\nOption B: Offer items where I gain more value - e.g., 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore. (My value gain: +2). Less gain for me.\nOption C: Offer items that are very low value to me, even if the gain is small, to offload them. E.g., 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore (Value gain: 0), or if I can push for 5 Wheat for 1 Ore (Value 30 -> 36, gain +6). That might be too aggressive.\n\nGiven the opponent's clear desire for Ore and their willingness to accept 1 Brick for 1 Ore, repeating that successful trade is the safest and most profitable immediate option. I still have plenty of Brick.\n\nFinal Decision: Try to repeat the successful trade.\nMy resource values:\nWheat: 8 @ 6 = 48\nWood: 11 @ 12 = 132\nSheep: 16 @ 17 = 272\nBrick: 19 @ 30 = 570\nOre: 13 @ 36 = 468\n\nTotal value: 1490\n\nIf I trade 1 Brick for 1 Ore:\nBrick: 19 - 1 = 18 (Value 18 * 30 = 540)\nOre: 13 + 1 = 14 (Value 14 * 36 = 504)\nNet value change: (540 + 504) - (570 + 468) = 1044 - 1038 = +6\nThis is a clear win. Player 0 accepted this before, so there's a good chance they will again.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore\"\n}\n```",

Wood is relatively low.\n\n7. **Potential Trades**:\n   - Since Ore is very valuable and I have 6, I might consider trading it for an even more valuable resource or a large quantity of a less valuable resource. However, it's hard to get a better value per unit than Ore.\n   - I could try to trade some of my less valuable resources (Wood, Wheat) for more valuable ones if possible.\n\n8. **Decision**:\n   - Given that I have a decent amount of resources and Ore is highly valued, I should look to trade something less valuable for something more valuable or at least of comparable value.\n   - One potential trade could involve offering Wheat or Wood for a more valuable resource.\n\n### Action\n\nConsidering the steps above, a potential trade could be offering some Wheat (the least valuable resource per unit I have) for a more valuable resource. However, since Ore is the most valuable and I already have it, the challenge is finding a trade that improves my total value.\n\nLet's propose a trade: \n- I have Wheat (Value: 6) and could offer some for a resource that's not too detrimental to give up from my opponent's perspective.\n\nLet's say I offer 4 Wheat for 1 Brick (since Brick is quite valuable and I already have a good amount of it, but it's still less valuable than Ore). The calculation would be:\n- Giving up 4 Wheat = 4 * 6 = 24 value\n- Gaining 1 Brick = 1 * 21 = 21 value\nThis trade doesn't seem beneficial as it reduces my total value.\n\nLet's consider another option:\n- Offering Wood for Ore or Brick could be viable since I still have some Wood.\n\nGiven that my last offer was accepted by Player 1 when I offered Sheep for Ore, and Player 1 offered Brick for Ore, it seems Ore is in demand.\n\nLet's try: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThe final action in the required format is:\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`",
