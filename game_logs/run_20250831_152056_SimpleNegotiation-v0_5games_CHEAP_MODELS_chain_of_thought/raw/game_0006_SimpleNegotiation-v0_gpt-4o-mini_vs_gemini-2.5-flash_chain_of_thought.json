Trades that offer more value than the resources I'm giving up will be prioritized. \n\n### Resource Values:\n- **Brick**: 25\n- **Ore**: 39\n- **Sheep**: 12\n- **Wood**: 12\n- **Wheat**: 5\n\nI can observe that Ore has the highest value to trade, while Brick is also relatively high. \n\n### Factors Influencing Decision-Making:\n1. **Resource Needs**: If I determine that I have more of a lower-value resource (like Wheat or Wood), I may consider trading those for higher-value resources.\n2. **Potential Benefit**: I need to allocate my resources effectively to scrutinize the value exchange in trades.\n3. **Opponent's Perspective**: I must consider what resources my opponent might want. If they lack high-value resources, they might be willing to trade effectively.\n\n### Opponent Consideration:\nIf my opponent has a relatively high quantity of a low-value resource and seeks to acquire resources that I have in abundance (like Sheep or Wood), I can leverage this to my advantage.\n\n### Possible Trades:\nLooking at the resource values, a trade that allows me to leverage my Sheep and Ore for Brick might be beneficial. An example of a trade could be **offering 3 Sheep and 2 Ore for 5 Brick and 2 Sheep**.\n\n### Decision:\nTo pursue the potential trade, I would make the following offer. \n\n**Trade Offer:**  \n`[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]`\n\nThis offer presents a good balance and aims to improve my collection of Brick while giving away some excess Sheep and Ore that I can afford to trade. The estimated value augmentation through this transaction also strengthens my overall resource strategy. \n\nWith this reasoning in mind, I submit the trade offer.",

I made a mistake in the previous turn by accepting. I need to be more careful.\n\nLet's assume the previous turn's state was *before* I made the decision, and hence the resources given are my current starting point for *this* turn to evaluate the new offer.\n\nMy current resources and their total value are:\n*   [Wheat]   Qty: 7    Value: 6 (Total: 42)\n*   [Wood]    Qty: 23   Value: 12 (Total: 276)\n*   [Sheep]   Qty: 18   Value: 16 (Total: 288)\n*   [Brick]   Qty: 15   Value: 27 (Total: 405)\n*   [Ore]     Qty: 19   Value: 37 (Total: 703)\nTotal value: 1714\n\nThe goal is to increase the total value of my resources.\n\nPlayer 0's new offer:\nOffered items: 5 Wheat, 4 Wood\nRequested items: 4 Sheep, 2 Ore\n\nLet's calculate the value of the offered and requested items:\nValue Offered by Player 0:\n*   5 Wheat: 5 * 6 = 30\n*   4 Wood: 4 * 12 = 48\nTotal value offered by Player 0 = 30 + 48 = 78\n\nValue Requested by Player 0:\n*   4 Sheep: 4 * 16 = 64\n*   2 Ore: 2 * 37 = 74\nTotal value requested by Player 0 = 64 + 74 = 138\n\nAnalysis:\nIf I accept this trade, I give away 138 value and receive 78 value.\nNet change in my total value = Value Received - Value Given = 78 - 138 = -60.\n\nThis trade would decrease my total resource value by 60. My primary goal is to increase my total value. Therefore, I should deny this offer.\n\nWhat might Player 0 be thinking? They are trying to get valuable resources (Sheep, Ore) by offering less valuable ones (Wheat, Wood). This is a beneficial trade for them.\n\nMy strategy should be to make offers where Value Received > Value Given, or to accept offers only if Value Received > Value Given.\n\nSince this trade is detrimental to me, I will deny it.\n\nI also need to consider making a new offer.\nI have a lot of Wood (23), Sheep (18), Brick (15), and Ore (19). Wheat (7) is relatively low.\nHowever, Wheat has a low value (6). Ore has the highest value (37).\n\nPossible items to offer (where I have high quantity or they are less valuable to me):\n*   Wood (23 qty, value 12)\n*   Wheat (7 qty, value 6) -- but I don't have much of this.\n*   Sheep (18 qty, value 16)\n\nPossible items to request (where I have low quantity or they are highly valuable to me):\n*   Ore (19 qty, value 37) -- I have quite a bit, but it's high value. Maybe I want more high-value items, or I want to trade low to high.\n*   Brick (15 qty, value 27)\n\nLet's think about a trade where I give away low value and get high value.\nFor example, offering Wood (low value) for Ore (high value).\nOr offering Sheep (medium value) for Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's try to offer something where Player 0 might benefit, but I benefit more.\nMaybe Player 0 has a lot of high-value resources and needs low-value resources for something.\n\nLet's try to offer resources I have in abundance for higher value resources.\nI have 23 Wood. It's the cheapest resource I have.\nI could try to trade Wood for Ore or Brick.\n\nConsider: Offer 10 Wood (10 * 12 = 120) for 3 Ore (3 * 37 = 111) and 1 Brick (1 * 27 = 27).\nTotal requested value: 111 + 27 = 138.\nTotal offered value: 120.\nNet gain: 138 - 120 = 18. This would increase my total value.\n\nHowever, Player 0 just offered me a bad deal. Maybe they are stingy or have different valuations.\nMy proposed offer might be too beneficial for me and they may deny it.\n\nLet's try a simpler, slightly less ambitious trade, but still positive for me.\nOffering Wood (low value per unit) for Brick (higher value per unit).\nI have 23 Wood. I have 15 Brick.\nOffer: 5 Wood (5 * 12 = 60) for 3 Brick (3 * 27 = 81).\nNet gain: 81 - 60 = 21. This looks like a good gain for me.\nI would still have 18 Wood remaining, and 18 Brick (if accepted).\n\nLet's try this. This trade offers Wood, which Player 0 might need if they are low on it.\nThis trade asks for Brick, which is a good value resource.\n\nFinal decision based on evaluation:\n1. Deny Player 0's current offer as it decreases my value.\n2. Make a new offer that increases my value.\n\nOffer: 5 Wood -> 3 Brick\nMy given value: 5 * 12 = 60\nMy requested value: 3 * 27 = 81\nNet gain for me: 81 - 60 = 21. This increases my total value.\n\nThe game lasts for 10 turns. I have made a mistake in the past, I must avoid future mistakes.\nThis trade is positive for me.\nTotal value with 5 Wood given and 3 Brick received:\nWheat: 7 * 6 = 42\nWood: (23 - 5) * 12 = 18 * 12 = 216\nSheep: 18 * 16 = 288\nBrick: (15 + 3) * 27 = 18 * 27 = 486\nOre: 19 * 37 = 703\nNew Total Value: 42 + 216 + 288 + 486 + 703 = 1735\nOld Total Value: 1714\nIncrease: 1735 - 1714 = 21.

This is a very good offer for me.\n\nI currently have 7 Wheat and 23 Wood, so I can easily afford to trade 4 Wheat and 3 Wood.\nI would gain 3 Ore and 2 Sheep, which are both valuable resources.\n\nConsidering opponent's perspective:\nThey are giving up relatively low-value items (Wheat, Wood) for higher-value items (Ore, Sheep). This suggests they might have an abundance of Wheat and Wood, or a strong need for Ore and Sheep. This trade seems beneficial for both parties if they are looking to convert lower value resources into higher value ones.\n\nGiven the significant positive value change for me, I should accept this offer.\n\nNext, I need to consider if I want to make a new offer after this.\nAfter accepting the trade, my resources would be:\n- Wheat: 7 - 4 = 3\n- Wood: 23 - 3 = 20\n- Sheep: 18 + 2 = 20\n- Brick: 15\n- Ore: 19 + 3 = 22\n\nI have previously offered 5 Wood for 3 Brick, which was rejected. My Wood quantity is still high, and Brick is more valuable than Wood. However, the last rejection might indicate Player 0 doesn't value Brick highly, or that my offer was not appealing.\n\nFor now, accepting this very profitable offer is the priority. Making another offer might be good, but completing this value-increasing one is paramount. I will prioritize accepting the current offer.\n[Accept]",

My goal is to increase my total value. Therefore, I should not accept this trade.\n\nNow, I need to consider making my own offer.\nLooking at my current resources, I have a good quantity of Wood (23), Sheep (18), Brick (15), and Ore (19). Wheat (7) is relatively low.\nThe values of resources are: Wheat (6), Wood (12), Sheep (16), Brick (27), Ore (37).\n\nI want to trade away lower value items for higher value items, or trade items I have in abundance for items that significantly increase my overall value, even if the per-unit value is lower, as long as the net transaction is positive.\n\nPlayer 0 has previously offered Wheat and Wood for Ore and Sheep. This suggests they might be interested in higher value items like Ore and Sheep, and perhaps have an abundance of lower value items like Wheat and Wood.\n\nI have a decent amount of Wood. Wood has a value of 12. Brick has a value of 27. Ore has a value of 37.\nPerhaps I can trade some Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's consider trading Wood for Brick:\nIf I offer 3 Wood (3 * 12 = 36 value) for 1 Brick (1 * 27 = 27 value), that's a negative trade for me.\nIf I offer 2 Wood (2 * 12 = 24 value) for 1 Brick (1 * 27 = 27 value), that's a positive trade for me (+3 value). This seems like a reasonable offer to make, as it's a small gain for me, and potentially attractive to Player 0 if they need Wood.\n\nLet's consider trading Wood for Ore:\nIf I offer my 3 Wood for 1 Ore (1 * 37 = 37 value), that's a positive trade for me (+1 value). Player 0 might not want to give up an Ore for just 3 Wood.\n\nGiven Player 0 just offered 5 Wood for 4 Brick, they might be low on Brick. This reinforces the idea of trading Wood for Brick.\nWhile 2 Wood for 1 Brick is a good deal for me, Player 0 might not accept it immediately if they are low on Brick.\n\nWhat if I try to get something with a very high value like Ore, by trading Wood?\nI have a significant amount of Wood.\nSay I offer 5 Wood (5 * 12 = 60). What can I get for it that makes it a good deal?\n- 2 Brick (2 * 27 = 54). Net -6 for me. No.\n- 1 Ore (1 * 37 = 37). Net -23 for me. No.\n- 1 Ore and 1 Brick (37+27=64). Net +4 for me. This means I'd offer 5 Wood for 1 Ore and 1 Brick. This seems balanced but could be too greedy for Player 0.\n\nLet's revisit the Wood for Brick idea, as Player 0 seems interested in Brick.\nThey just offered 5 Wood for 4 Brick. This means they are willing to give up 5 Wood (60 value) to get 4 Brick (108 value). This indicates a high need for Brick. They are losing value significantly.\n\nThis gives me an advantage. I have Brick. If they want Brick badly, I can sell it at a premium.\nHowever, my goal is to *increase* my total value. So I want to be the one *receiving* Brick, or trading away my Wood/Wheat/Sheep for Brick/Ore.\n\nSince they want Brick, they are unlikely to trade me Brick for Wood.\nInstead, they might be willing to give me higher value items for my Wood.\n\nLet's assume Player 0 is running low on Brick, and I have 15 Brick (value 27). I also have 23 Wood (value 12).\nIf I trade something I have a lot of (Wood) for something high-value which Player 0 *might* have a lot of (Ore), it's worth a shot.\n\nI need to make an offer that nets me a positive value while being attractive enough for Player 0 to consider.\nPlayer 0 recently traded Wheat and Wood for Ore and Sheep. This suggests they value Ore and Sheep.\n\nWhat if I offer a resource that I have a high quantity of and relatively lower value (Wood) for a resource that has higher value (Ore or Brick)?\n\nLet's try to get Ore, as it's the highest value.\nI have 23 Wood, value 12. I have 19 Ore, value 37.\nIf I offer 3 Wood (36 value) for 1 Ore (37 value), that's a +1 for me. This is a very small gain, but still a gain.\nPlayer 0 might not accept giving 1 Ore for just 3 Wood if they don't have abundant Ore.\n\nGiven their last offer (5 Wood for 4 Brick), they seem to value Brick highly and perhaps have a surplus of Wood. I have a surplus of Wood and Brick.\n\nLet's reconsider the previous turns.\nTurn 1: P0 offered 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep. P1 Accepted.\nThis means Player 1 gained (5 Brick (135) + 2 Sheep (32)) - (3 Sheep (48) + 2 Ore (74)) = 167 - 122 = +45 value. Good trade for P1.\nMy resources after this trade (recalculating from start, as game state is not directly provided after previous moves):\nInitial: Wheat 7(6), Wood 23(12), Sheep 18(16), Brick 15(27), Ore 19(37)\nAfter accepted offer:\nSheep: 18 - 3 + 2 = 17\nOre: 19 - 2 = 17\nBrick: 15 + 5 = 20\nWheat: 7\nWood: 23\nUpdated resources after first accepted trade for player 1:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 7    Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 23   Value: 12\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 17   Value: 16\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 20   Value: 27\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 17   Value: 37\nCurrent value: (7 * 6) + (23 * 12) + (17 * 16) + (20 * 27) + (17 * 37) = 42 + 276 + 272 + 540 + 629 = 1759. (Initial value 1714 + 45 gained = 1759)\n\nTurn 2: P0 offered 5 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 4 Sheep, 2 Ore. P1 Rejected. Good decision, negative value for P1.\nTurn 3: P1 offered 5 Wood -> 3 Brick. P0 Rejected.\nValue offered by P1 (5 Wood): 5 * 12 = 60\nValue requested by P1 (3 Brick): 3 * 27 = 81\nNet gain for P1 would be +21. Player 0 rejected this, likely because they didn't want to give up 3 Brick, or felt the 5 Wood was not enough.\n\nTurn 4: P0 offered 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 3 Ore, 2 Sheep. P1 Accepted.\nLet's evaluate this trade:\nGive: 3 Ore (3 * 37 = 111), 2 Sheep (2 * 16 = 32). Total: 143.\nReceive: 4 Wheat (4 * 6 = 24), 3 Wood (3 * 12 = 36). Total: 60.\nNet change: 60 - 143 = -83.\n\nWait, I need to check my understanding of the \"Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\" log.\nAh, the log says \"Offered items: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> Requested items: 3 Ore, 2 Sheep\". This means *Player 0* is offering 4 Wheat, 3 Wood and requesting 3 Ore, 2 Sheep.\nSo Player 1 is *giving* 3 Ore, 2 Sheep and *receiving* 4 Wheat, 3 Wood.\nThis trade is a value loss for Player 1 (-83). This seems like a bad move.\n\nLet me adjust my interpretation and strategy. If I'm accepting trades that lose me value, I'm doing it wrong.\nThe game instructions state: \"Your task is to trade such that the total value of your resources increases.\"\nThe previous log entry \"Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\" did not imply I initiated this. It implies P0 made it to me, and I accepted.\nThis means I accepted a trade where I gave away high value items (Ore, Sheep) for low value items (Wheat, Wood). My total value decreased.\n\nI must have misunderstood the previous acceptance. I need to be more careful.\n\nLet's re-calculate my actual resources after the accepted trades, assuming I followed the rule \"total value of your resources increases\".\nThis implies the previous decision to accept the trade (4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 3 Ore, 2 Sheep) was an error in my reasoning process if I was calculating net value.\nOr, it was accepted for another strategic reason not immediately apparent, but the problem states \"Your task is to trade such that the total value of your resources increases.\"\n\nGiven that I made a mistake, I need to assume my current resources are as stated at the very beginning of this turn, before Player 0's last offer, but after all previous actions.\nHowever, I was reset to the starting resources for each turn for processing. I will assume my current resources are the initial ones and that I evaluate each offer from that initial state, and that the game will track the actual resources, so I should ensure I only make value increasing trades.\n\nMy resources are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 7    Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 23   Value: 12\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 18   Value: 16\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 15   Value: 27\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 19   Value: 37\n\nCurrent offer from Player 0: Offered 5 Wood -> Requested 4 Brick.\nValue of 5 Wood (P0 offers to me): 5 * 12 = 60\nValue of 4 Brick (P0 requests from me): 4 * 27 = 108\nIf I accept, my value change is 60 (received) - 108 (given) = -48.\nDecision: Deny.\n\nNow, I need to make my own offer.\nMy goal is to increase my total value. I want to trade away lower value items for higher value items, or make a very favorable exchange of items I have an abundance of.\nI have a significant amount of Wood (23). Its value is 12.\nOre is 37. Brick is 27. Sheep is 16. Wheat is 6.\n\nI can offer Wood for Ore or Brick.\nLet's try to get Ore (highest value).\nIf I offer X Wood for Y Ore. I want Y*37 > X*12.\nIf I offer 3 Wood (36 value) for 1 Ore (37 value), that's +1. Small gain, but a gain. Player 0 might accept if they are desperate for Wood.\nIf I offer 5 Wood (60 value) for 2 Ore (74 value), that's +14. A good gain, but maybe too much for Player 0.\n\nLet's try Brick.\nI offered 5 Wood for 3 Brick previously, which P0 rejected. (P1 gain +21)\nThis implies P0 feels 5 Wood is not enough for 3 Brick, or they don't want to give up 3 Brick.\n\nGiven P0's last offer (5 Wood for 4 Brick), they clearly want Brick and are willing to pay Wood for it.\nThis means I should *not* offer Wood for Brick. I should aim to get Wood (or other low value items) from them, by giving Brick, but only if the value exchange is in my favor.\nHowever, my goal is to increase my value. If I give them Brick, I need to ensure I get higher value back.\n\nWhat if I offer Brick (which they seem to want) for Ore (which is highest value)?\nExample: 1 Brick (27 value) for 1 Ore (37 value) is impossible for them.\nSo I would need to offer 1 Brick and some Wood for 1 Ore.\n1 Brick (27) + 1 Wood (12) = 39. For 1 Ore (37). This would be -2 for me. Not good.\n\nPerhaps I should trade items in which I have a large quantity (Wood, Sheep) for items that are valuable and I have less of (e.g., more Brick, or more Ore).\n\nLet's consider trading Sheep (16 value) for Ore (37 value).\nI have 18 Sheep.\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (32 value) for 1 Ore (37 value), that's +5 for me. This is a decent gain.\nPlayer 0 has previously valued Ore and Sheep (in their request: 3 Ore, 2 Sheep). They seem to value both.\n\nThis seems like a good offer. I have 18 Sheep, so I can afford to trade 2Sheep.\nValue given: 2 Sheep = 2 * 16 = 32\nValue received: 1 Ore = 1 * 37 = 37\nNet gain: +5.\nThis is a positive value trade for me. It's a relatively small number of units, so maybe palatable for P0.\n\nLet's refine this. Player 0 has abundant Wood based on their last offer.\nThey offered: 5 Wood -> 4 Brick. So they want Brick, and have Wood.\nI have Wood, and I have Brick. I *don't* want to give up Brick for Wood, unless the value is extremely good.\n\nI have an abundance of Wood. Let's try to trade Wood for Ore again.\nP0 rejected my 5 Wood for 3 Brick offer previously. (P1 net gain +21).\nSo P0 isn't willing to give up 3 Brick for 5 Wood.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wood for a smaller quantity of Ore?\nI have 23 Wood.\nOffer: 8 Wood (8 * 12 = 96) -> 2 Ore (2 * 37 = 74). This is -22 for me. No.\nOffer: 8 Wood (96) -> 3 Ore (3 * 37 = 111). This is +15 for me. This is a good value trade!\nIs 8 Wood too much to trade for P0? Do they have 3 Ore?\nThey previously requested 3 Ore so they might have it but want to keep it.\n\nLet's stick to the previous rationale that P0 needs Brick.\nI should exploit this. If P0 needs Brick, and I have Brick, I should try to trade something I have a lot of for Brick, but at a huge discount to me. Which doesn't make sense.\nMy goal is to increase my value. I should extract value from P0's need, not cater to it.\n\nIf they offered 5 Wood for 4 Brick, they are willing to give 5 Wood (60 value) to get 4 Brick (108 value).\nThis means *if* I were to make a trade with Brick, I'd want to get something valuable in return.\nE.g., if I give 1 Brick (27 value), I want more than 27 value back.\nIf I give 1 Brick (27) for 3 Wood (36), it's +9 for me. P0 wants Brick, P0 has Wood. This is excellent for me.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wood]\nMy value: Give 1 Brick (27). Receive 3 Wood (36). Net change = +9.\nThis trade is consistent with P0's likely needs (more Brick, less Wood possibly).\nThis seems like a very strong offer for me.\n\nFinal check:\nCurrent resources: Wheat(7), Wood(23), Sheep(18), Brick(15), Ore(19)\nP0 offer: 5 Wood -> 4 Brick. (Value change for me: 60 - 108 = -48). Decision: Deny.\n\nMy proposed offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wood.\nValue cost: 1 Brick * 27 = 27\nValue gain: 3 Wood * 12 = 36\nNet gain: +9.\nThis increases my total value. It aligns with P0 apparently needing Brick and having Wood.\n\nWhat if P0 has low Brick count too? The offer 5W -> 4B suggests they want Brick, not necessarily that they are low on it, but rather they need it for something specific (e.g. building).\nIf they don't have enough Brick to trade me, then this offer wouldn't work.\nBut if they need Brick, then receiving 1 Brick might be appealing to them, even if they give up 3 Wood.\nThey might have an abundance of Wood.\n\nI will go with this offer.\n\n```\nP0 offer: 5 Wood -> 4 Brick\nMy evaluation: Value P0 offers (5*12=60).

This means I should aim to trade away resources with a lower relative value for resources with a higher relative value.\n\nLooking at my previous turns, I accepted one trade with Player 0 where I received 3 Sheep and 2 Ore and gave away 5 Brick and 2 Sheep. Let's re-evaluate that.\n* Received: 3 Sheep (3 * 16 = 48) + 2 Ore (2 * 37 = 74) = 122\n* Gave: 5 Brick (5 * 27 = 135) + 2 Sheep (2 * 16 = 32) = 167\nThis trade resulted in a net loss of 45 value. This was a bad trade, and I need to be more careful. It seems I miscalculated something or made a hasty decision. I should focus on the *net change* in value.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the other accepted trade: Offered items: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> Requested items: 3 Ore, 2 Sheep\n* Received: 3 Ore (3 * 37 = 111) + 2 Sheep (2 * 16 = 32) = 143\n* Gave: 4 Wheat (4 * 6 = 24) + 3 Wood (3 * 12 = 36) = 60\nThis trade resulted in a net gain of 83 value. This was a good trade.\n\nI need to be very careful with value calculations moving forward.\n\nMy current resource values are:\n* Wheat: 6 (lowest value per unit)\n* Wood: 12\n* Sheep: 16\n* Brick: 27\n* Ore: 37 (highest value per unit)\n\nI have a relatively high quantity of Wood (23) and Ore (19), and a good quantity of Sheep (18) and Brick (15). My Wheat is low (7).\n\nI want to trade away lower value items for higher value items.\nI have a lot of Wood. I could try to trade Wood for something higher value like Brick or Ore.\n\nPlayer 0 previously offered: 5 Wood -> 4 Brick.\nValue of 5 Wood = 5 * 12 = 60\nValue of 4 Brick = 4 * 27 = 108\nNet gain = +48. This was a good offer that I rejected! I need to be more careful. It seems my calculations or assessment were off. I should have accepted that.\n\nPlayer 0 also previously offered: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 3 Ore, 2 Sheep. This was a good trade that I accepted.\n\nPlayer 0 just made no new offer. It's my turn to make an offer.\n\nI want to shed some Wood or Wheat for Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's consider offering a large quantity of Wood for some Brick or Ore.\nI have 23 Wood.\n\nProposal 1: Offer Wood for Brick\nIf I offer 7 Wood (7 * 12 = 84 value) for 3 Brick (3 * 27 = 81 value). This is a slight loss, not good.\nIf I offer 7 Wood for 4 Brick (4 * 27 = 108 value). This is a gain of 24. This looks reasonable.\n\nProposal 2: Offer Wood for Ore\nIf I offer 10 Wood (10 * 12 = 120 value) for 3 Ore (3 * 37 = 111 value). Small loss.\nIf I offer 10 Wood for 4 Ore (4 * 37 = 148 value). This is a gain of 28. This looks good.\n\nI have a decent amount of Wood and I'm trying to get higher value items.\nLet's make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me but might still be attractive to the opponent if they need Wood.\n\nLet's try to get Ore. Ore is my highest value item.\nI will offer a quantity of Wood that is significantly higher in number but lower in total value for a smaller number of high-value items, aiming for a net positive value.\n\nI have rejected previous good offers, and accepted a bad one. I need to be systematic.\nMy thinking process for an offer:\n1. Identify resource(s) I have in abundance or with a low per-unit value that I'm willing to trade. (Wood, Wheat)\n2. Identify resource(s) I want, ideally those with a high per-unit value. (Ore, Brick, Sheep)\n3. Propose a trade that has a net positive value for me.\n\nLet's propose trading Wood for Ore.\nCurrent quantities: Wood: 23, Ore: 19\n\nAttempt 1: Offer 8 Wood (8 * 12 = 96) for 3 Ore (3 * 37 = 111). Net gain = +15.\nThis is a gain for me. It might be appealing to Player 0 if they're low on Wood.\n\nAttempt 2: What about converting Brick? I have 15 Brick.\nI rejected Player 0's offer of 5 Wood for 4 Brick (value 60 for 108, gain 48). I made a mistake.\nI offered 1 Brick for 3 Wood (value 27 for 36, gain 9). Player 0 rejected. This was a low gain for me, and maybe not appealing to them.\n\nI have plenty of Wood. I will try to offload some of it for something more valuable.\nLet's make a generous offer to myself that Player 0 might accept if they need wood.\n\nOffer 8 Wood (Value 96) for 3 Ore (Value 111).\nMy Gain: 111 - 96 = +15.\nThis is a positive value trade for me.\n\nFinal check of resources:\nWheat: 7 (Value: 6)\nWood: 23 (Value: 12)\nSheep: 18 (Value: 16)\nBrick: 15 (Value: 27)\nOre: 19 (Value: 37)\n\nI have a lot of Wood. It's a lower value resource. I want more Ore.\n\nI will offer 8 Wood for 3 Ore.\n[Offer: 8 Wood -> 3 Ore]",
