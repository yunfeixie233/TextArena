      "response": "[Nf3xe4] is not a legal move in this position because the white knight on f3 has already moved to e5 earlier in the game. The knight currently on e5 is the only knight present on that square.\n\nLet me reevaluate the current position:\n\nWhite has a knight on e5 (which just captured on e5 from f3). Black responded by playing ...Nf6-e4, attacking the knight on d5. But wait\u2014there's a mistake in the board setup or move interpretation.\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\n- White has a knight on e5.\n- Black just moved Ne4, which attacks the pawn on d5, but there is no knight on d5\u2014there's a white pawn on d5 that just captured from e4.\n\nActually, the move [f6e4] by Black is perfectly valid\u2014it moves the knight from f6 to e4, attacking the white pawn on d5.\n\nNow it's White's turn. The pawn on d5 is under attack by the black knight on e4.\n\nI must decide how to respond. The options are:\n1. Move the knight from e5.\n2. Capture the knight on e4.\n3. Move the king.\n4. Defend the d5 pawn.\n\nBut no piece currently defends d5, and the e5 knight cannot capture on e4 (no diagonal or L-shaped connection).\n\nThe correct response is to **relocate the knight from e5** or **support d5**, but the most principled move is to **develop while solving the threat**.\n\nWait\u2014the knight on e5 is pinned against the black queen if Black's queen is on d8? Not quite.\n\nActually, **White can play Nc3**, developing the knight and preparing to recapture if Black takes on d5.\n\nBut wait\u2014**the strongest move here is dxc5? No, no capture available.**\n\nAlternatively, **Nc6? No, not possible.**\n\nLet's clarify:\n\nAfter 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d5 4. exd5 Ne4\n\nNow White must deal with the threat to the pawn on d5.\n\nBut the knight on e5 is **attacked by the possibility of ...Nxf2**, but more immediately, the pawn on d5 is attacked by the knight on e4.\n\nWhite's best move here is to **play d3**, defending the pawn on d5 and threatening to kick the knight with f3.\n\nWait\u2014no knight on f3 anymore.\n\nActually, **the knight is on e5**, and we need to respond to ...Ne4.\n\nBest move: **Nf3** immediately is not possible.\n\nWait\u2014Bd3 is possible! But not developed.\n\nBest developing move that also deals with threats: **Nc3**, defending the d5 pawn indirectly? No, doesn't defend.\n\nActually, **only moves that protect d5 are f3 or d3 or c3 with pawn**.\n\nc2-c3 supports d4, not d5.\n\nOnly **f3** or **d3** can help, but **f3** attacks e4 knight.\n\nYes!\n\nThe best move is **f3**, attacking the knight on e4.\n\nSo:\n\n**[f2f3]**\n\nThis attacks the knight on e4, forcing it to retreat or be exchanged.\n\nWhite gains time and strengthens the center.\n\nPerfect move.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[f2f3]",

The knight currently on e5 is the only knight present on that square.\n\nLet me reevaluate the current position:\n\nWhite has a knight on e5 (which just captured on e5 from f3). Black responded by playing ...Nf6-e4, attacking the knight on d5. But wait\u2014there's a mistake in the board setup or move interpretation.\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\n- White has a knight on e5.\n- Black just moved Ne4, which attacks the pawn on d5, but there is no knight on d5\u2014there's a white pawn on d5 that just captured from e4.\n\nActually, the move [f6e4] by Black is perfectly valid\u2014it moves the knight from f6 to e4, attacking the white pawn on d5.\n\nNow it's White's turn. The pawn on d5 is under attack by the black knight on e4.\n\nI must decide how to respond. The options are:\n1. Move the knight from e5.\n2. Capture the knight on e4.\n3. Move the king.\n4. Defend the d5 pawn.\n\nBut no piece currently defends d5, and the e5 knight cannot capture on e4 (no diagonal or L-shaped connection).\n\nThe correct response is to **relocate the knight from e5** or **support d5**, but the most principled move is to **develop while solving the threat**.\n\nWait\u2014the knight on e5 is pinned against the black queen if Black's queen is on d8? Not quite.\n\nActually, **White can play Nc3**, developing the knight and preparing to recapture if Black takes on d5.\n\nBut wait\u2014**the strongest move here is dxc5? No, no capture available.**\n\nAlternatively, **Nc6? No, not possible.**\n\nLet's clarify:\n\nAfter 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d5 4. exd5 Ne4\n\nNow White must deal with the threat to the pawn on d5.\n\nBut the knight on e5 is **attacked by the possibility of ...Nxf2**, but more immediately, the pawn on d5 is attacked by the knight on e4.\n\nWhite's best move here is to **play d3**, defending the pawn on d5 and threatening to kick the knight with f3.\n\nWait\u2014no knight on f3 anymore.\n\nActually, **the knight is on e5**, and we need to respond to ...Ne4.\n\nBest move: **Nf3** immediately is not possible.\n\nWait\u2014Bd3 is possible! But not developed.\n\nBest developing move that also deals with threats: **Nc3**, defending the d5 pawn indirectly? No, doesn't defend.\n\nActually, **only moves that protect d5 are f3 or d3 or c3 with pawn**.\n\nc2-c3 supports d4, not d5.\n\nOnly **f3** or **d3** can help, but **f3** attacks e4 knight.\n\nYes!\n\nThe best move is **f3**, attacking the knight on e4.\n\nSo:\n\n**[f2f3]**\n\nThis attacks the knight on e4, forcing it to retreat or be exchanged.\n\nWhite gains time and strengthens the center.\n\nPerfect move.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[f2f3]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Illegal move: f6e4.

This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety. Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach.

This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety. Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach.
