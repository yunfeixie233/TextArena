This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety. Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach.

Capturing the d4 pawn with [e5d4] allows me to maintain control of the center, open lines for my pieces, and potentially create imbalances in the position.

Capturing the knight with [c6d4] regains the material I lost earlier and challenges White's central control, while also opening lines for my pieces and maintaining counterplay.

This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety. Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach.

      "response": "As Black, my plan is to continue prioritizing piece development and king safety, as castling kingside is currently blocked by my own bishop on f8. Instead, I'll develop that bishop to c5, which activates it, pressures White's central pawn on d4 (via the knight on d4), and prepares for future opportunities like exchanging pieces or opening lines. This move supports my overall strategy of active play and sets up potential kingside castling once the path is clear.\n\n[c8c5]",
