Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach. Always double-check your move format and ensure the move is legal in the current position.\n[GAME] Current board:\n   +-----------------+\n 8 | r n b q k b n r |\n 7 | p p p p p p p p |\n 6 | . . . . . . . . |\n 5 | . . . . . . . . |\n 4 | . . . . . . . . |\n 3 | . . . . . . . . |\n 2 | P P P P P P P P |\n 1 | R N B Q K B N R |\n   +-----------------+\n    a b c d e f g h \nValid moves: [g1h3], [g1f3], [b1c3], [b1a3], [h2h3], [g2g3], [f2f3], [e2e3], [d2d3], [c2c3], [b2b3], [a2a3], [h2h4], [g2g4], [f2f4], [e2e4], [d2d4], [c2c4], [b2b4], [a2a4]\n[White] [e2e4]\n[GAME] Player 0 made the following move: e2e4\n[GAME] Current board:\n   +-----------------+\n 8 | r n b q k b n r |\n 7 | p p p p p p p p |\n 6 | . . . . . . . . |\n 5 | . . . . . . . . |\n 4 | . . . .
