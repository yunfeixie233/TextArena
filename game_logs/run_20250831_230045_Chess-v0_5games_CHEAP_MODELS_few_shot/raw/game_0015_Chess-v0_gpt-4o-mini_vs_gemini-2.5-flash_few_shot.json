      "response": "[Black] I see that the board description and valid moves presented by the game engine for my turn did not reflect White's move [e4d5] from the previous turn. The board still shows my pawn on `e5` and White's pawn on `e4`, indicating White's capture was not registered. My previous attempt [d8d5] was based on the assumption that White had played [e4d5].\n\nGiven the current board state and valid moves, White's last move was not [e4d5]. I need to reconsider my move based on the actual board.\n\nThe valid moves indicate that `d5` is currently occupied by a Black pawn. Therefore, the last move by White was not a capture on `d5`. I also see that the White king is on `e2`.\n\nMy priority is to continue with development, gain control of the center, and exploit White's exposed King. I will develop my knight, controlling the center and preparing for castling and further attacks.\n\n[g8f6]",
