Although this seems attractive, there\u2019s a hidden cost: giving away my only Ore when its value is extremely high, or losing eight Wheat and three Wood could cripple Deck synergy for future trades. I prefer not to accept this inequation due to its disproportionate resource symmetry. I reject the offer.\n\n[Deny]",
