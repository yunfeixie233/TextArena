To do this, I should try to trade resources I have in abundance or those with lower individual value for resources that are more valuable.\n\nLet's consider trading some Wheat or Wood for more valuable resources like Ore or Brick, or even Sheep if the terms are good. Ore is the most valuable resource for me.\n\nMy first offer will be to try and get more Ore, or Brick.\n\nTurn 1:\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nExplanation: I'm offering 5 Wheat (Value 25) and 3 Wood (Value 33) for a total of 58 value, to get 1 Ore (Value 40). This is a loss for me in terms of raw value, but I am exploring if Player 1 is willing to part with Ore for less valuable resources. It's a starting point to see their valuation. Perhaps they have excess Ore or need Wheat/Wood. I can adjust my strategy based on their response.",
