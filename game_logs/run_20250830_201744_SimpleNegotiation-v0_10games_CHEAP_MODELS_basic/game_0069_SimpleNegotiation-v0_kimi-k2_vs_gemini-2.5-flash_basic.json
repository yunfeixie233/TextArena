      "response": "### Thought Process:\n\n1. **Initial Resource Valuation**:\n   - First, calculate the current total value of your resources based on the given quantities and individual values.\n   - Wheat: 16 * 6 = 96\n   - Wood: 10 * 9 = 90\n   - Sheep: 25 * 16 = 400\n   - Brick: 16 * 22 = 352\n   - Ore: 6 * 40 = 240\n   - Total current value: 96 + 90 + 400 + 352 + 240 = 1,178\n\n2. **Resource Analysis**:\n   - **Sheep**: You have the most sheep (25), but their per-unit value is relatively low (16). This is a good candidate for trading.\n   - **Ore**: You have the least ore (6), and its per-unit value is very high (40). This is valuable and should be traded sparingly or to acquire other high-value resources.\n   - **Brick**: You have 16 bricks (value 22), which is a decent amount. Could be traded if needed.\n   - **Wheat**: High quantity (16) but low value (6). Good for padding trades but not very valuable otherwise.\n   - **Wood**: Moderate quantity (10) and moderate value (9). Could be part of trades.\n\n3. **Trade Goal**:\n   - Try to trade lower-value resources (like Wheat, Sheep) for higher-value resources (like Ore, Brick).\n   - Aim to maximize the total value, so focus on trades where the value of received resources is higher than the value of given resources.\n\n4. **Potential Trade Offer**:\n   - **Offer to give up Sheep and Wheat**, as they are in high quantity and lower value.\n   - **Request Ore and Brick**, as they are higher value and you have fewer of them.\n   - Example offer: 5 Sheep (5 * 16 = 80) and 3 Wheat (3 * 6 = 18) for 3 Ore (3 * 40 = 120) and 1 Brick (1 * 22 = 22). This gives 98 value given and 142 value received, a net gain of +44.\n\n5. **Sweeten the Deal**:\n   - The opponent might not accept a lopsided trade, so adjust the quantities to make it fairer while still profitable.\n   - Revised offer: 5 Sheep and 2 Wheat (5*16 + 2*6 = 92) for 2 Ore (2*40 = 80) and 1 Brick (1*22 = 22). Total given: 92, received: 102, net gain +10. This seems more balanced.\n\n6. **Final Trade Offer**:\n   - A more balanced offer: 3 Sheep (48) and 2 Wheat (12) for 2 Ore (80) and 2 Brick (44). Net given: 60, received: 124, gain +64. This might be too aggressive.\n   - Another attempt: 4 Sheep (64) and 1 Wheat (6) for 2 Ore (80) and 1 Brick (22). Given: 70, received: 102, gain +32. This seems reasonable.\n\n7. **Select a Midpoint**:\n   - The first two attempts were either too aggressive or too weak. The 3 Sheep and 2 Wheat for 2 Ore and 1 Brick (gain +10) is conservative. Let\u2019s aim slightly higher.\n   - Offer: 3 Sheep (48) and 2 Wheat (12) for 1 Ore (40) and 3 Brick (66). Given: 60, received: 106, gain +46. This might seem fair.\n\n8. **Stick to a Simple Offer**:\n   - Simplify to make the offer cleaner: 3 Sheep (48) and 2 Wheat (12) for 5 Brick (110). Given: 60, received: 110, gain +50. But this asks for too much Brick.\n   - Alternative: 5 Sheep (80) for 2 Ore (80) and 2 Sheep (32). Given: 80, received: 112, gain +32. This is essentially 5 Sheep for 2 Ore and 2 Sheep (net 3 Sheep for 2 Ore). More realistic.\n\n9. **Final Decision**:\n   - The most straightforward mid-value offer is: 3 Sheep (48) and 2 Ore (80) for 5 Brick (110) and 2 Sheep (32). \n   - Wait, no! You cannot give both Sheep and Ore since Ore is too valuable. Revamp:\n   - **Best offer**: 4 Sheep (64) and 2 Wheat (12) for 2 Ore (80). Given: 76, received: 80, gain +4. This is minimal but realistic, as Ore is scarce.\n\n10. **Re-evaluate**:\n    - Instead of involving Ore (your highest-value resource), avoid giving it away. Focus on trading Sheep and Wheat for Brick.\n    - Offer: 5 Sheep (80) and 3 Wheat (18) for 4 Brick (88) and 2 Sheep (32). Given: 98, received: 120, gain +22. Net becomes 3 Sheep and 3 Wheat for 4 Brick. This seems fair.\n\n### Final Action:\nPropose a trade where the opponent feels it's fair, but you still gain value. The best balance is to trade Sheep and Wheat for Brick.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 5 Brick]",
