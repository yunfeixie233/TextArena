Most gainful single move available to me  \nSelling Sheep nets only 16. Trying to dislodge any Brick/Ore from Player 1 means buying (not selling) Sheep. I have 12 Sheep, can easily spare 3 (value 48) for only 1 Brick (value 22) + 1 Ore (value 32) = 54. Net gain 6. That is the only trade format I have seen accepted so far (1-for-1 Brik/Ore ratios) so it will probably go through, and it adds more to my strongest resource pile.\n\n4.
