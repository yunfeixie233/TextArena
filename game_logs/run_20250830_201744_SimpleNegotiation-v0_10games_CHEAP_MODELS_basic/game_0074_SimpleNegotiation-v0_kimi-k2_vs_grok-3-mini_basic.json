      "response": "### Turn-by-turn reasoning\n\n#### 1. Analyse my resources and what is scarce vs. abundant\n- Wheat: 5 / Value 6 \u2192 low in both quantity and unit-value  \n- Wood: 21 / Value 11 \u2192 plenty (highest quantity) but only medium unit-value  \n- Sheep: 5 / Value 15 \u2192 reasonably scarce, medium value  \n- Brick: 14 / Value 27 \u2192 decent quantity and high value  \n- Ore: 14 / Value 37 \u2192 decent quantity and the *highest* unit-value  \n\nMy **least-desired** resources are Wheat and Wood (Wood even more so because both quantity AND unit-value are low).  \nMy **most-desired** are Brick and Ore (high value). Sheep is middle-of-the-road.\n\n#### 2. Goals for the deal\n- **Off-load Wood first** \u2013 it\u2019s my most abundant but lowest value per card.  \n- **Gain Ore or Brick**.  \n- **Keep trades reasonably generous so the opponent accepts**.\n\nThe 11 Wood slots are \u201cexchange surplus\u201d to acquire value. New Wood literally only adds 11 value, while gaining Ore adds 37 or Brick adds 27. A 2-to-1 or 3-to-1 conversion of Wood into premium goods is a **huge** gain for me.\n\n#### 3. Determine an opening offer (Turn 1)\nLet\u2019s give 6 Wood \u2192 for **2 Ore**.  \nOpponent valuation: depends on their needs, but Ore is usually valuable to everyone.\n\n- **Cost to me**: lose 6 Wood \u2192 lose 6 \u00d7 11 = 66 value  \n- **Gain**: receive 2 Ore \u2192 gain 2 \u00d7 37 = 74 value  \n\u2192 **Net gain to me**: +8 value.  \nPlus it remains fairly reasonable; 3:1 wood-for-ore seems acceptable in many meta-games.\n\nOffer text:  \n*[Offer: 6 Wood -> 2 Ore]*\n\n(Note that a 5:1 Wood \u2192 Ore was even more slanted in my favour, but cutting Wood count still remains attractive even at 6 for 2.)\n\n#### 4. Simple decision table for incoming offers\n- **Accept immediately** if the offer gives me a good deal, meaning the unit-value of what I receive partly replaces what I give, and does so favourably. A quick heuristic: if I\u2019d be +>10 value net, likely take it.  \n- **Counter-offer** or outright deny if the deal is unattractive (net loss of value/bad ratios).\n\n#### 5.
