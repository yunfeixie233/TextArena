      "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation carefully. Let me check the current state after all these trades and offers.\n\nAfter the last accepted trade (Offer: 3 Brick, 3 Sheep -> 9 Wood), my resources would have updated as:\n- Gained: 3 Brick, 3 Sheep\n- Lost: 9 Wood\n\nLooking at the last offer from Player 1: \"3 Brick for 7 Wood\" - I rejected this, which appears correct given my resource values.\n\nCurrent resource analysis:\n- Wheat: 17 (value 6)\n- Wood: 23-9-7 = 7 (value 11) - assuming the 7 for 2 offer was separate\n- Sheep: 11+3 = 14 (value 16)\n- Brick: 14+3 = 17 (value 26)\n- Ore: 12 (value 32)\n\nPlayer 1 just made the offer: [Offer: 3 Brick -> 7 Wood]\n\nThis is essentially asking for 77 value (7 Wood \u00d7 11) in exchange for 78 value (3 Brick \u00d7 26). The values are very close, but I'm giving up Wood which has a lower value than Brick, and I'm already low on Wood.\n\nGiven my current Wood count is likely very low (around 7-14 depending on which trades happened), giving up 7 Wood would leave me with almost none, which could be problematic for future trades.\n\n[Deny]",
