      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the game and the initial resources\nThe Negotiation Game is about trading resources to increase their total value. I start with: Wheat (9, Value:6), Wood (24, Value:12), Sheep (24, Value:18), Brick (9, Value:27), Ore (8, Value:37).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the initial total value of resources\nTo understand the starting point, calculate the total value: (9*6) + (24*12) + (24*18) + (9*27) + (8*37) = 54 + 288 + 432 + 243 + 296 = 1313.\n\n## Step 3: Identify potential trades based on resource values\nResources with higher values per unit are more valuable. Ore (Value:37) and Brick (Value:27) are highly valued, while Wheat (Value:6) is the least valued. Consider trading less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a trade offer for the first turn\nSince Wheat is the least valuable, consider offering it. I have 9 Wheat. A potential trade could involve offering Wheat for a more valuable resource. For example, offering Wheat for Brick or Ore could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on the specific trade offer for Turn 1\nLet's offer Wheat for Brick because both are relatively easier to value and trade. I have 9 Wheat, so a possible offer could be: '[Offer:9 Wheat ->3 Brick]' since 3 Brick = 3*27 = 81, which is more than the value of 9 Wheat = 9*6 = 54.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the opponent's potential response\nThe opponent might accept if they have excess Brick and need Wheat, or they might deny if they don't have Brick to spare or don't value Wheat. The response is uncertain, but making an offer is the first step.\n\n## Step 7: Make the trade offer for Turn 1\n'[Offer:9 Wheat ->3 Brick]' is a reasonable starting point because it aims to increase the total value by acquiring more valuable resources.\n\nThe final answer is: \n[Offer:9 Wheat ->3 Brick]",
