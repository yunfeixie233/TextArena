I want to obtain high-value resources and give away lower-value resources, ideally with a net gain in value.\n\nLet's calculate the current total value of my resources:\n5 * 6 (Wheat) = 30\n13 * 11 (Wood) = 143\n22 * 18 (Sheep) = 396\n17 * 28 (Brick) = 476\n15 * 34 (Ore) = 510\nTotal Value = 30 + 143 + 396 + 476 + 510 = 1555\n\nI am looking for trades where I gain more value than I give.\nOre and Brick are my highest value resources. Sheep and Wood are medium, and Wheat is the lowest.\n\nI have a decent quantity of Sheep. Player 0 made no offer, so I'll initiate.\n\nI will try to trade some Sheep and Wood for Brick or Ore, as those are my higher value items.\nLet's consider trading Sheep for Brick.\n1 Sheep = 18. 1 Brick = 28.\nTo make it beneficial, I want to trade fewer Sheep for more Brick, or an equivalent value of Sheep for more than an equivalent value of Brick.\n\nLet's try: offering 1 Sheep (value 18) and 1 Wood (value 11) for 1 Brick (value 28).\nTotal value offered: 18 + 11 = 29. Total value requested: 28. This is not good for me as I lose 1 value.\n\nWhat if I offer 2 Sheep (value 36) for 1 Brick (value 28) and 1 Ore (value 34)?\nTotal value offered: 36. Total value requested: 28 + 34 = 62. This seems too good to be true for me. Player 0 would likely deny.\n\nLet's try a more balanced but still beneficial offer.\nI have a lot of Sheep. I'll try to trade sheep for brick.\nOffer 1 Sheep (18) for 1 Wood (11). Not good.\n\nPerhaps trade low-value resources for high-value resources.\nOffer Wheat (value 6) and Wood (value 11) for Brick (value 28).\n2 Wheat (12) + 1 Wood (11) = 23. Request 1 Brick (28). Gain of 5. This is\nOffer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick. Value diff: 23 vs 28. Gain 5. Good.\n\nLet's try a simpler one. Give up some Sheep to get some Ore.\nOffer: 2 Sheep (36) for 1 Ore (34). I lose 2 value. Not good.\n\nHow about trading a few Sheep for a Brick?\nOffer: 2 Sheep (36) for 1 Brick (28). I lose 8 value. Not good.\n\nI need to make sure the \"Requested Resources\" value is higher than or equal to the \"Offered Resources\" for me to ideally gain value.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood for Brick or Ore.\nIf I offer 3 Wood (33) for 1 Ore (34). I gain 1 value.\nIf I offer 2 Wood (22) for 1 Brick (28). I gain 6 value. This seems like a reasonable offer for me.\n\nLet's try this:\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n\nThis offers 2 pieces of Wood (Value 11 each, total 22) for 1 piece of Brick (Value 28).\nThis results in a gain of 6 value for me (28 - 22 = 6).\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
