      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the offer made by Player 0.\n\nPlayer 0's offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\n\nLet's break down the values:\n\n- Resources offered by Player 0: \n  - 3 Sheep = 3 * 12 = 36\n  - 2 Ore = 2 * 38 = 76\n  Total value offered = 36 + 76 = 112\n\n- Resources requested by Player 0:\n  - 5 Brick = 5 * 27 = 135\n  - 2 Sheep = 2 * 12 = 24\n  Total value requested = 135 + 24 = 159\n\nThe total value requested by Player 0 (159) is greater than the total value offered by Player 0 (112), making this a bad deal for me (Player 1) as it stands, since I would be losing value.\n\nLet's examine my current resources and their total value:\n- Wheat: 15 * 5 = 75\n- Wood: 20 * 12 = 240\n- Sheep: 25 * 12 = 300\n- Brick: 14 * 27 = 378\n- Ore: 21 * 38 = 798\n\nTotal value = 75 + 240 + 300 + 378 + 798 = 1791\n\nIf I accept the offer:\n- I give away 5 Brick = 5 * 27 = 135 and 2 Sheep = 2 * 12 = 24. Total value given = 135 + 24 = 159\n- I receive 3 Sheep = 3 * 12 = 36 and 2 Ore = 2 * 38 = 76. Total value received = 36 + 76 = 112\n\nMy new total value would be: 1791 - 159 + 112 = 1744\n\nAccepting this offer would decrease my total value from 1791 to 1744, which is not beneficial.\n\nGiven the imbalance in the trade, my best response is to deny the offer as it stands. However, I should consider making a counteroffer that could be more balanced or beneficial for both parties.\n\nBefore making a counteroffer, let's assess what I have and what might be of interest to Player 0. Since the original offer involved Sheep, Brick, and Ore, let's consider a trade involving these resources.\n\nA potential counteroffer could involve adjusting the quantities or the resources to make it more appealing. For example, I could think of offering something that is of less value to me but could be of more value to Player 0, and requesting something in return that is valuable to me.\n\nLet's directly formulate a counteroffer. \n\nSince the details of Player 0's resources are not known, a safe approach is to counter with resources that are less critical to me or adjust the quantities.\n\nA possible counteroffer: [Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore, 1 Sheep]\n\nLet's check the value:\n- I give away 5 Brick = 5 * 27 = 135\n- I receive 2 Ore = 2 * 38 = 76 and 1 Sheep = 1 * 12 = 12. Total value received = 76 + 12 = 88\n\nThis is still not favorable. Let's think of another combination.\n\nAnother possible counteroffer could be: [Offer: 4 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\n\nLet's check the value:\n- I give away 4 Brick = 4 * 27 = 108 and 1 Sheep = 1 * 12 = 12. Total value given = 108 + 12 = 120\n- I receive 3 Ore = 3 * 38 = 114\n\nThis is still not great but closer. Let's adjust again.\n\nConsidering the initial offer was not in my favor and adjusting to make a new offer that might be more acceptable to both, a reasonable action is to deny the original offer and propose a new one.\n\nMy response will be: [Offer: 4 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 3 Ore, 1 Sheep]\n\nLet's check the value:\n- I give away 4 Brick = 4 * 27 = 108 and 2 Sheep = 2 * 12 = 24. Total value given = 108 + 24 = 132\n- I receive 3 Ore = 3 * 38 = 114 and 1 Sheep = 1 * 12 = 12. Total value received = 114 + 12 = 126\n\nThis still results in a slight loss but is more balanced.\n\nMy action: [Offer: 4 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 3 Ore, 1 Sheep]",

Initially, I had:\n- Wheat: 15 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 20 (Value: 12)\n- Sheep: 25 (Value: 12)\n- Brick: 14 (Value: 27)\n- Ore: 21 (Value: 38)\n\nAfter the trade with Player 0 where I offered 5 Brick -> Requested 2 Ore, 1 Sheep:\n- I gave away 5 Brick.\n- I received 2 Ore and 1 Sheep.\n\nSo, the new quantities are:\n- Wheat: 15\n- Wood: 20\n- Sheep: 25 + 1 = 26\n- Brick: 14 - 5 = 9\n- Ore: 21 + 2 = 23\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the new quantities and values\nLet's calculate the total value of my resources now:\n- Wheat: 15 * 5 = 75\n- Wood: 20 * 12 = 240\n- Sheep: 26 * 12 = 312\n- Brick: 9 * 27 = 243\n- Ore: 23 * 38 = 874\n\nTotal value = 75 + 240 + 312 + 243 + 874 = 1744\n\n## Step 3: Consider the next move\nSince Player 0 made no new trade offer, I need to think about making a new offer to potentially increase my total resource value. I should look for resources that are valuable to me and see if I can offer something in exchange that is less valuable to me but potentially valuable to Player 0.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze potential trades\nGiven the values, Ore is the most valuable resource for me, followed by Brick. I already have a significant amount of Ore (23), so while it's valuable, I need to consider if giving some away could be beneficial if I get something even more valuable. Brick is also valuable, and I have 9 of them.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a new offer\nConsidering my resources and their values, one potential trade could involve offering some of my less valuable resources (in relative terms) to gain more of the highly valued ones or to consolidate resources that might be more valuable to me in the long run. For instance, offering some Sheep (Value: 12) or Wood (Value: 12) for more Ore or Brick could be a strategy.\n\n## Step 6: Decide on a specific trade offer\nLet's consider offering some Wood or Sheep for Ore or Brick. Since Ore is very valuable and I already have a lot, offering some Sheep for Brick might be a good strategy because Brick is also very valuable.\n\n## Step 7: Make a trade offer\nI will offer 5 Sheep for 2 Brick. This translates to: '[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]'.\n\n## Step 8: Format the trade offer according to the game's special tokens\nThe offer is: '[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]'.\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the game situation and the current resources.\nThe game is a negotiation game where the goal is to increase the total value of resources through trades. The current resources and their values are: Wheat (Qty: 15, Value: 5), Wood (Qty: 20, Value: 12), Sheep (Qty: 25, Value: 12), Brick (Qty: 14, Value: 27), Ore (Qty: 21, Value: 38).\n\n## Step 2: Review the previous trades and their outcomes.\nIn the previous turns, the following trades were made or proposed:\n1. Player 0 offered 3 Sheep, 2 Ore for 5 Brick, 2 Sheep. Player 1 rejected.\n2. Player 1 offered 5 Brick for 2 Ore, 1 Sheep. Player 0 accepted.\n3. Player 1 offered 5 Sheep for 2 Brick. Player 0 rejected.\n4. Player 1 offered 5 Wheat for 1 Brick. Player 0 rejected.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the current state after the previous trades.\nAfter the trades:\n- Player 1 initially had: Wheat (15), Wood (20), Sheep (25), Brick (14), Ore (21).\n- After the accepted trade (5 Brick for 2 Ore, 1 Sheep): Player 1 gave 5 Brick and received 2 Ore and 1 Sheep.\n- So, the new quantities are: Wheat (15), Wood (20), Sheep (26), Brick (9), Ore (23).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the current total value of resources.\nThe current total value = (15 * 5) + (20 * 12) + (26 * 12) + (9 * 27) + (23 * 38) = 75 + 240 + 312 + 243 + 874 = 1744.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the best course of action for the next turn.\nTo increase the total value, we need to think about what we can offer or request that would be beneficial. We should look for resources that are valuable and consider what Player 0 might be looking for.\n\n## Step 6: Consider potential trades based on the current resources and their values.\nWe have a significant amount of Ore (Value: 38), which is very valuable. We are relatively low on Brick (Value: 27) after the last trade. A potential trade could involve offering something less valuable for Brick or other high-value resources.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a new trade offer.\nLet's consider offering some Wheat or Wood (since they are less valuable) for Brick or possibly Ore if we can get a good deal. However, we already have a lot of Ore, so requesting more Ore might not be the best unless it's for something very valuable.\n\n## Step 8: Propose a specific trade.\nGiven that we have 15 Wheat and it's not very valuable, we could offer some Wheat for Brick. For example: [Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick].\n\n## Step 9: Check if the proposed trade is beneficial.\nThe value of 4 Wheat is 4 * 5 = 20. The value of 1 Brick is 1 * 27 = 27. So, the trade is beneficial as we gain 7 in value.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]}$",
