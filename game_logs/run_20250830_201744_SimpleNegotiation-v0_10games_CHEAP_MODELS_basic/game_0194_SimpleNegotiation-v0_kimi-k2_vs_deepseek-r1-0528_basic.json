My stock is still:\n\n- Wheat 17  \n- Wood 22  \n- Sheep 7  \n- Brick 10  \n- Ore 11  \n\nI have not yet gained or lost anything.\n\nIt\u2019s Turn 4 (only 7 rounds left) and I feel I must start moving values quickly.\n\nTarget direction  \n- I am overweight in low-value Wheat (5) and Wood (12).  \n- High-value Brick (23) and Ore (36) are what I really need.  \n- Sheep is manageable (15) but can also be turned into more value.\n\nThe key is to offer the opponent something he can hear while still improving my own value. Over the rejected rounds I\u2019ve seen:\n\n- P1 values Brick rather dearly (offered 1 Brick \u21d2 4 Wood).  \n- My earlier 5 Wheat + 3 Wood for 1 Brick + 1 Ore was refused, so my Mountain of Wheat/Wood won\u2019t move that steep bundle.\n\nA smaller, bite-size proposal that does NOT ask for Ore (P1 seemed reluctant to give it up) but still claims Brick can work:\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\n\nIf accepted, the value swing for me is  \n(-4 Wood \u00d7 12 \u2013 1 Sheep \u00d7 15) + (2 Brick \u00d7 23) = (-48 \u2013 15) + 46 = \u201317, which at first glance looks bad, but that raw accounting trick is misleading. My marginal utility:  \n- Wood drops from 22 \u2192 18, still full comfort stock.  \n- Brick rises from 10 \u2192 12, closer to the ore I need for end-game dominance.  \nThe exchange rate per Brick of 2 Wood + \u00bd Sheep is ~31\u00bd/2 = 15.75 per Brick, well below 23 gain value and roughly the low bid P1 refused earlier (4 Wood = 48 for 1 Brick). I\u2019m sweetening it by adding only half a Sheep. From P1\u2019s side it feels generous; from my side it lifts two high-value bricks in exchange for low-value surplus.\n\nIf P1 wants more Wheat instead of the single Sheep, I can pivot quickly; but this is my immediate minimal ask.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",
