This trade increased my total value by (2 * 34) - (8 * 5) - (11 * 8) = 68 - 40 - 88 = -60. This was a bad trade, my value decreased. I need to be more careful.\nIt looks like I'm giving up too many low-value resources for a small amount of high-value resources.

Ore is the most valuable at 34. Sheep and Wood are also relatively low value. I should try to get more Ore or Brick, and give up Wheat, Wood, or Sheep.\n\nLet's look at the past trades.

This suggests Player 1 values my low-value resources more, or they have a surplus of Ore.\n\nI have 10 Wheat, 10 Wood, 13 Sheep, 17 Brick, 26 Ore.\nI should try to get rid of Wheat, Wood or Sheep, and get Ore or Brick.\n\nI will try to trade away some Wheat and Wood for Brick this time, as Brick is also valuable. Or, I can try to get more Ore for less of my lower value resources.\n\nI will try to get more Ore, but offer fewer low-value resources.\nLast trade was 8 Wheat + 11 Wood = 19 items for 2 Ore (value 68). The cost was (8*5 + 11*8) = 40+88 = 128. This was a significant loss.\n\nLet's try to trade Sheep and Wood for Ore.

I need to re-evaluate how I'm calculating the value. My goal is to *increase* my total value.\nSo, requested value MUST be higher than offered value.\n\nLet's try to sell off some lower value items for higher value ones.\nI have a significant amount of Ore. Maybe Player 1 wants some Ore? However, that's not my goal. My goal is to increase my total value, not just trade.\n\nInstead, I will try to get rid of Wheat, Wood, Sheep for Brick or Ore.\nI have 10 Wheat, 10 Wood, 13 Sheep, 17 Brick, 26 Ore.\n\nLet's try to trade 10 Wheat, 10 Wood (all of them) and some sheep for a significant amount of Ore to balance out the previous loss and gain value.\n\nThis is a tricky turn. I made a bad trade and lost value. I need to recover.\nI will try to bundle some of my low-value resources for a high-value one.\nI have Wheat (5), Wood (8), Sheep (14), Brick (25), Ore (34).\n\nI have 10 Wheat, 10 Wood, 13 Sheep.\nI want Ore (34) or Brick (25).\n\nWhat if I offer 10 Wheat and 5 Sheep, for 2 Ore?\nValue offered: (10 * 5) + (5 * 14) = 50 + 70 = 120.\nValue requested: (2 * 34) = 68. This is still a very bad trade for me.\n\nI need to make an offer where the requested items have a higher value than the offered items. This is fundamental for increasing my total value.\n\nLet's aim for a smaller trade with guaranteed profit for me, or at least no loss.\n\nMaybe Player 1 wants Brick? I have 17.\nNo, I should continue getting high value items.\n\nLet's try trading Wheat and Wood for Brick.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Brick]\nValue Offered: (5 * 5) + (5 * 8) = 25 + 40 = 65\nValue Requested: (3 * 25) = 75\nThis looks like a profitable trade for me.
