      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first calculate the total value of the resources I currently have.\n\n1. Wheat: 24 * 6 = 144\n2. Wood: 6 * 12 = 72\n3. Sheep: 10 * 18 = 180\n4. Brick: 15 * 28 = 420\n5. Ore: 23 * 33 = 759\n\nTotal value = 144 + 72 + 180 + 420 + 759 = 1575\n\nTo maximize the total value, I need to consider making trades that increase this value. Let's analyze the resources and their values:\n\n- The most valuable resource I have is Ore (Value: 33), and I have a substantial quantity of it (23).\n- The least valuable resource is Wheat (Value: 6), and I have a significant quantity of it (24).\n\nLet's consider potential trades that could increase my total value. Ideally, I want to trade away resources of lower value for those of higher value or maintain the quantity of higher-value resources while gaining more.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering Wheat (since it's the least valuable) in exchange for a resource that is more valuable or at least maintaining the value.\n\n## Potential Trade Analysis:\n1. Offering Wheat for Ore: Not ideal since I already have a lot of Ore.\n2. Offering Wheat or Wood for Brick or Sheep: Could be a good option since I'm trading lower value for higher value.\n\n## Example Trade:\nLet's offer some Wheat for Sheep or Brick, as both are more valuable than Wheat.\n\n- I have 24 Wheat, and if I offer some for Sheep (Value: 18), it could be a good start.\n\n## Trade Offer:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]' is a possible trade because 4 Wheat (4*6 = 24 value) is being traded for 1 Sheep (1*18 = 18 value), which doesn't seem immediately beneficial. However, let's think about trading Wheat for other resources.\n\n## Better Trade Offer:\nConsidering the value, let's directly think of trading the least valuable resource (Wheat) for something more valuable.\n\n'[Offer: 6 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]' could be considered. Here, I'm offering (6*6) + (1*12) = 36 + 12 = 48 value for 1 Ore (1*33 = 33 value), which is not beneficial.\n\n## More Realistic Trade:\nLet's think about not losing value significantly but potentially gaining. Since Ore is very valuable and I have a lot of it, I'll try not to give it away.\n\n## Initial Trade Offer:\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]' is a possible start. Here, I'm offering 2 Wheat (2*6 = 12) for 1 Brick (1*28 = 28), which is a gain.\n\nLet's start with this offer.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat,  -> 1 Brick]'\n\nTurn 1: '[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'",

I traded 4 Wheat, which totals to 4 * 6 = 24 in value. The gain is 18 (Sheep) - 24 (Wheat) = -6. This was not a favorable trade in terms of immediate value but could be part of a larger strategy or an attempt to build a specific set of resources.\n\n3. **Consider Potential Trades:** \n   - I should look for opportunities to trade resources that are less valuable to me for those that are more valuable or that I need for a future strategy.\n   - Given the current values and quantities, trading away some Wheat (low value) or accumulating more of other resources could be beneficial.\n\n4. **Formulate a New Offer:**\n   - Since Wheat is abundant and not very valuable, and I have a good amount of Ore which is very valuable, I might look to trade some Wheat or other less valuable resources for more valuable ones or for resources that are scarce for me.\n   - One possible trade could involve offering Wheat for another resource.\n\n### New Trade Offer\n\nLet's consider offering 5 Wheat for 1 Wood. Currently, Wood is valued at 12, and Wheat at 6. Trading 5 Wheat (total value of 30) for 1 Wood (value of 12) is not favorable. Let's think of a more balanced trade.\n\nConsidering the values and the need to increase the total value of resources, a more reasonable trade might involve offering some of my less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\n### Action\n\nLet's make an offer to Player 1: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Wood]`.\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 1 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore]`\n\nHowever, to simplify and follow the exact format required:\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Wood]`\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds.",

Given the values: Wheat (6) < Wood (12) < Sheep (18) < Brick (28) < Ore (33), we should aim to get more of the higher-value resources.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the last offer made by Player 1 and consider a counteroffer or a new offer.\nPlayer 1's offer was (1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick). The value given is (1*12 + 1*18) = 30, and the value received is (3*28) = 84. This is a good deal for Player 0, but since it was rejected, we need to consider alternative trades.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a new trade offer based on the current resources and the goal to increase total value.\nSince Player 1 rejected the offer involving Brick, let's consider other resources. We have Wheat, which is of low value. Offering Wheat for a higher-value resource could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 8: Check if there's an opportunity to make a trade that increases the total value.\nOffering Wheat for Wood or Sheep could be a start, but since the previous offers for Wood were rejected, we might need to adjust our strategy.\n\n## Step 9: Propose a new trade.\nLet's consider offering Ore or Brick for Sheep or Wood, as these are relatively higher value trades. However, we need to ensure we have the resources to offer.\n\n## Step 10: Make a decision on the next trade offer.\nGiven that we have a significant amount of Wheat and Ore, and considering the previous rejections, a potential offer could involve Wheat and another resource. However, since our last offers involving Wheat were rejected, we should think differently.\n\n## Step 11: Decide on a specific trade.\nLet's offer something that could be attractive. We could offer [Offer: 5 Ore, 2 Wheat -> 3 Sheep] or something similar, but we need to ensure it's reasonable.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the value of the proposed trade.\nFor [Offer: 5 Ore, 2 Wheat -> 3 Sheep]:\n- Giving: (5*33) + (2*6) = 165 + 12 = 177\n- Receiving: 3*18 = 54\nThis trade is not beneficial.\n\n## Step 13: Explore alternative trades.\nConsider [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]: \n- Giving: 2*18 = 36\n- Receiving: 1*33 = 33\nThis is not beneficial.\n\n## Step 14: Consider a trade that involves Brick, as it's a relatively high-value resource we have.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]: \n- Giving: 2*28 = 56\n- Receiving: 1*33 = 33\nThis is not beneficial.\n\n## Step 15: Revisit the idea of trading Wheat for a higher-value resource.\nLet's try [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Wood]: \n- Giving: 6*6 = 36\n- Receiving: 1*12 = 12\nThis is not beneficial.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 3 Brick, 1 Wheat -> 2 Ore]}$",
