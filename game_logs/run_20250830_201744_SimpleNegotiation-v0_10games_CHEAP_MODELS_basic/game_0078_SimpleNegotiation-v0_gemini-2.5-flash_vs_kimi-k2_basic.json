This would be a decrease in my total value. I should reject this offer.\n\nI also need to consider making a new offer. My goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Ore and Brick are my most valuable resources. I have a lot of Wheat and Sheep, which are less valuable. I've tried trading Wheat and Sheep for Brick and Ore before, but Player 1 keeps rejecting.

I want to trade my less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\nI have a significant amount of Ore. Perhaps I can try to get some Brick, which is also very valuable.\n\nPlayer 1 offered 6 Wheat and 4 Wood for 1 Ore. The value is 66 for 35. This is bad for me.\nI need to make an offer where the value I receive is greater than the value I give.\n\nLet's try to trade some Wheat/Wood for Brick or Ore.\nPlayer 1 seems interested in Ore. Maybe I can offer a smaller amount of Ore for a lot of less valuable resources to Player 1, then use those resources to get Brick. However, my goal is to *increase* my total value. So I should try to acquire Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's consider what Player 1 might accept from previous offers. Player 1 offered Wheat and Wood for Ore. This suggests Player 1 values Ore. I am currently holding 24 Ore, which is a good amount. I also have 8 Brick which is decent.\n\nI will try and get Brick again. Wheat and Sheep are my most abundant and least valuable items.\nMy previous offer of 12 Wheat, 10 Sheep -> 4 Ore was rejected. Value: (12*5) + (10*12) = 60 + 120 = 180. Value of 4 Ore = 4*35 = 140. This was a good deal for Player 1, but still rejected.\n\nMaybe Player 1 doesn't have a lot of Ore or Brick to spare.\n\nLet's try a different strategy. Player 1 offered 6 Wheat (30) and 4 Wood (36) for 1 Ore (35). Player 1 is offering 66 value for 35 value. This is a very good deal for Player 1.\nI will deny Player 1's offer.\n\nI will make an offer for Brick. I have a lot of Wheat and 20 Sheep.\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of Wheat and Sheep for a small amount of Brick?\nLet's try 15 Wheat and 10 Sheep for 3 Brick.\nValue of 15 Wheat = 15 * 5 = 75\nValue of 10 Sheep = 10 * 12 = 120\nTotal offered value = 75 + 120 = 195\nValue of 3 Brick = 3 * 29 = 87\nThis is a bad offer for Player 1.\n\nI need to make an offer that is more appealing to Player 1, but still benefits me.\nWhat if I offer slightly less valuable items for something more valuable?\nI have 24 Wheat, 5 Wood, 20 Sheep, 8 Brick, 24 Ore.\n\nPlayer 1 seems to want Ore. If I offer Ore, what would I want in return?\nIf I offer 1 Ore (35 value), what would I want from Player 1?\nPlayer 1 offered 6 Wheat, 4 Wood (66 value) for 1 Ore (35 value). This shows Player 1 is willing to give away a lot of these resources for Ore.\n\nMaybe I can capitalize on Player 1's apparent need for Ore.\nOffer: 1 Ore -> 3 Brick.\nValue of 1 Ore = 35. Value of 3 Brick = 3 * 29 = 87. This is a good deal for me, but maybe too much for Player 1 since 3 Brick is a lot.\n\nWhat about a smaller trade involving Ore?\nOffer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick + some Wheat/Wood/Sheep.\nValue 1 Ore = 35. Value 1 Brick = 29. So I need at least 6 more value. Maybe 1 Sheep (12 value).\nOffer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep. Value 35 for 29+12=41.
