For example, we could consider offering Wheat (Value = 5) or Wood (Value = 12) since they have lower values compared to Brick (Value = 23), Ore (Value = 34), and Sheep (Value = 15).\n\nLet's formulate a counteroffer:\n- Offer 5 Wood (Value = 12 * 5 = 60) and 3 Wheat (Value = 5 * 3 = 15), totaling 75 in value.\n- Request 2 Ore (Value = 34 * 2 = 68), which is less than the total value we're offering but let's adjust to make it more appealing.\n\nHowever, a more balanced approach would be to directly counter with resources we have in surplus or lower value and request higher value resources.\n\nLet's directly make an offer:\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\n\nCalculating the values:\n- 5 Wood = 5 * 12 = 60\n- 3 Wheat = 3 * 5 = 15\nTotal value offered = 60 + 15 = 75\n\n- 2 Ore = 2 * 34 = 68\n\nThis offer is still slightly unfavorable as we're giving away more value (75) than we're receiving (68). Let's adjust the quantities.\n\nLet's make another offer:\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\n\nCalculating the values:\n- 4 Wood = 4 * 12 = 48\n- 2 Wheat = 2 * 5 = 10\nTotal value offered = 48 + 10 = 58\n\n- 2 Ore = 2 * 34 = 68\n\nThis trade is favorable as we're receiving more value (68) than we're giving away (58).\n\nThus, my response for this turn is:\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",

I've previously made offers that were rejected, but let's think about what's valuable and what I can spare.\n\nTo gain more Ore (since it's the most valuable resource), I could think about offering something in return. My last offer was [Offered items: 4 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore].\n\nLet's try a similar but potentially more appealing offer:\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer gives away: 3 Wheat * 5 = 15, 2 Wood * 12 = 24; Total = 15 + 24 = 39\nAnd requests: 1 Ore * 34 = 34\n\nThe net gain of this trade is 34 - 39 = -5, which is a slight loss.\n\nHowever, considering I'm trying to gain Ore and my current resources, let's slightly adjust our strategy to make a more reasonable offer.\n\nMy action: [Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis simplifies to giving away: 3 Wheat * 5 = 15, 1 Wood * 12 = 12; Total = 15 + 12 = 27\nAnd gaining: 1 Ore * 34 = 34\n\nThe net gain = 34 - 27 = 7, which is a gain.\n\nSo, my turn: [Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
