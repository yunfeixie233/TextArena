We have a substantial quantity of both. Sheep and Wood have relatively lower values. \n\nLet's consider making an initial offer that involves trading some of our lower-value resources or resources we have in abundance relative to their value, for something that could potentially increase our total value or at least maintain it while setting up for future trades.\n\nGiven the values, a reasonable initial trade could involve offering resources like Wheat or Wood for something more valuable.

We previously offered 5 Wheat and 2 Brick for 4 Ore, which was rejected. Let's consider a different offer. Giving up Wheat (the least valuable resource) and possibly some other less valuable resources for Ore could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 7: Decide on a trade\nLet's offer 6 Wheat (6*6 = 36 value) for 2 Ore (2*33 = 66 value), which is a gain of 30 in total value.\nThe offer would be: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\n\n## Step 8: Convert the decision into the required format\nThe trade offer is: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "### Current State of Resources\n\nAfter reviewing the previous transactions:\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Initially 17, offered 4 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 19, so the new quantity is 17 - 19 = -2. But since you can't offer more than you have, let's recount the actual transactions: \n  - 1st offer: 4 Wheat (accepted)\n  - 2nd offer: 4 Wheat (rejected, so it comes back)\n  - 3rd offer: 5 Wheat (rejected, so it comes back)\n  - 4th offer: 6 Wheat (accepted)\n\nSo, the total Wheat offered and actually gone is 4 + 6 = 10 Wheat. Thus, the remaining Wheat is 17 - 10 = 7.\n\n- **[Wood]**: Initially 6, offered 2 + 2 = 4 (since the other 2 offers were rejected and the resources returned), so the new quantity is 6 - 2 (from the first accepted offer) = 4 (because the second offer was rejected and Wood was returned).\n  \n- **[Sheep]**: Initially 13, received 3 (from the first accepted offer), so the new quantity is 13 + 3 = 16.\n\n- **[Brick]**: Initially 24, no change from the offers, so it remains 24.\n\n- **[Ore]**: Initially 22, received 2 (from the last accepted offer), so the new quantity is 22 + 2 = 24.\n\nThus, the corrected quantities are:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 7   Value: 6\n- [Wood]    Qty: 4    Value: 12\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 16   Value: 18\n- [Brick]   Qty: 24   Value: 25\n- [Ore]     Qty: 24   Value: 33\n\n### Game State and Plan\n\nThe game has progressed 4 turns with 6 turns remaining. The task is to increase the total value of the resources.\n\nLet's analyze the current state and decide on the next move.\n\n1. **Current Total Value**:\n   - [Wheat]   Qty: 7   Value: 6   => 7 * 6 = 42\n   - [Wood]    Qty: 4    Value: 12  => 4 * 12 = 48\n   - [Sheep]   Qty: 16   Value: 18  => 16 * 18 = 288\n   - [Brick]   Qty: 24   Value: 25  => 24 * 25 = 600\n   - [Ore]     Qty: 24   Value: 33  => 24 * 33 = 792\n   - **Total Value** = 42 + 48 + 288 + 600 + 792 = 1770\n\n2. **Potential Trades**:\n   To increase the total value, we should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. \n\n   - Offering [Wheat] (Value: 6) for other resources could be beneficial if we can get higher value resources.\n   - We could also consider trading some [Wood] (Value: 12) if it leads to acquiring resources with a higher total value.\n\n### Next Move\n\nLet's examine a potential trade:\n- We can offer some [Wheat] or [Wood] for resources that might increase our total value.\n\nConsidering the values:\n- Offering 3 [Wheat] (Value: 18) for 1 [Ore] (Value: 33) would be beneficial as it increases the total value (33 - 18 = 15 more).\n\nLet's propose an offer:\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
