My goal is to increase my total resource value. I have a lot of Ore, which is high value. I also have a lot of Brick. Player 0 seems interested in Ore, so I'll try to get more Ore for some Brick.\n\nMy last offers for 2 Brick -> 1 Ore have been rejected. 2 Brick has a value of 6, while 1 Ore has a value of 38. That's a bad trade for Player 0, so it makes sense that they rejected them. I need to make a more appealing offer for Player 0.\n\nLet's try to offer something closer in value to the Ore.\nIf I offer 4 Brick, that's a value of 12 (4 * 3). Still not close enough to 38.\nIf I offer 1 Sheep (value 13) + 1 Brick (value 3) = 16. Still too low.\n\nPlayer 0's offer of (3 Wheat, 4 Wood) for 1 Ore suggests they value their Wheat and Wood highly, and/or value Ore highly. The values for Wheat (1) and Wood (1) are low.\n\nI want more Ore, but I can't keep offering 2 Brick -> 1 Ore.\n\nLet's try to trade some of my high quantity resources (Wood) for something I might need, or for something that gives a better value. However, the game states my objective is to increase the *total value* of my resources. Ore is the highest value resource I have.\n\nInstead of trying to get more Ore from P0 right now, let's try to make a profitable trade.\nPerhaps trading some of my Brick for Sheep or Wheat/Wood if the quantity makes it worthwhile.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the Ore for Brick trade. I currently have 10 Brick (value 30) and 14 Ore (value 38).\nPlayer 0 is offering low-value items for high-value items, so I should try the same, but with items where my quantities are higher.\n\nLet's try to get more Sheep or another high value resource.\nIf I offer: 1 Ore (Value 38) -> 3 Sheep (Value 39). This would be a good trade for me, improving my overall value slightly. But it's unlikely P0 will accept this.\n\nLet's go back to Brick.\nMy Brick (value 3) is cheaper than Player 0's Ore (value 38).\nI need to offer a lot to get 1 Ore.\n\nTo get 1 Ore (Value 38), I need to offer at least 13 Brick (Value 39). I only have 10. So I can't just trade Brick for Ore.\n\nWhat about trading some of my excess Wood for something with good value?\nI have 9 Wood (value 9).\nIf Player 0 is offering 3 Wheat (value 3) and 4 Wood (value 4) for 1 Ore (value 38), they're trying to make a huge profit.\n\nLet's assume Player 0 rejected my previous offers because they were not good for them.\nI need to make an offer that is slightly tilted in my favor, but plausible for P0.\n\nI have 6 Wheat, 9 Wood, 5 Sheep, 10 Brick, 14 Ore.\n\nLet's try to trade some of my low-value resources for something better.\nMaybe I can trade Wood and Wheat for Sheep or Brick.\n\nIf the goal is to increase total value, I want to trade low-value items for high-value items where my acquired value is greater than my offered value.\n\nConsider offering: 2 Sheep (Value 26) -> 1 Ore (Value 38). This is a good trade for me. I gain 12 value. I have 5 Sheep, so I can afford to lose 2. This is a bit risky if P0 prioritizes total value too.\n\nLet's try an offer that makes sense based on the relative values, but is still profitable for me.\nI have a lot of Ore. Player 0 seems interested in Ore.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore (value 38) for a combination of other goods that add up to more than 38 value for me?\nFor instance, 1 Ore (value 38) -> 3 Sheep (value 39). Still a small gain.\n1 Ore -> 1 Sheep (value 13) + 2 Brick (value 6) = 19. Not enough.\n\nLet's reconsider Player 0's most recent offer. It was 3 Wheat (3) + 4 Wood (4) for 1 Ore (38). Player 0 attempts to gain 31 value. This is a very greedy offer.\n\nI need to be greedy, but palatable.\nI'll offer some of my cheaper items for more valuable items.\n\nI still want to get Ore, as it's the highest value. But I can't offer enough of my Brick.\nWhat if I offer Brick + Sheep for Ore?\nLet's try to get 1 more Ore.\nValue of 1 Ore = 38.\nIf I offer: 3 Brick (value 9) + 2 Sheep (value 26) = Total 35.\nThis is close to 38, so Player 0 might accept.\nMy gain if accepted: 38 (Ore) - 35 (Brick + Sheep) = 3 value. This is a small gain, but it's a gain.\nI have 10 Brick and 5 Sheep, so I can afford this.\n\nLet's try this offer.\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
