After analyzing the history, Player 0 seems interested in Sheep based on their past offers (e.g., trading Brick for Sheep directly in their \"2 Brick for 2 Sheep\" offer).

My Sheep are abundant (Qty: 20, Value: 12 each), so trading them for higher-value resources like Brick (Value: 22 each) is ideal. \n\nHistory shows Player 0 rejected my previous Sheep-for-Brick offers (e.g., 3 Sheep for 2 Brick or 3 Sheep for 3 Brick). To appeal to them, I'll increase the Sheep quantity slightly while keeping a ratio that feels fair based on their valuations.
