      "response": "Based on the current trades and negotiations, Player 1 has made some successful trades and has built a strategy around gaining resources. \n\nHere's the summary of trades that took place:\n- Player 1 accepted 3 offers of 1 Ore for trades of 2, 3, and 4 Brick, respectively.\n- Player 1 denied an offer for 4 Brick but accepted later the same offer for 3 Brick.\n\nNow, let's calculate Player 1's current resource values after the trades:\n\n### Current Resource Tally:\n1. **Wheat**: 14 (Value: 6)\n2. **Wood**: 20 (Value: 8)\n3. **Sheep**: 16 (Value: 18)\n4. **Brick**: 8 (previous was 8 + trades totaling 9 bricks received but without knowing how many bricks were spent)\n5. **Ore**: 5 (previous was 9 - 4 trades)\n\nWe need to negotiate some trade to increase the total value of resources in hand.\n\n### Current Inventory Value Calculation:\n- Wheat: 14 * 6 = 84\n- Wood: 20 * 8 = 160\n- Sheep: 16 * 18 = 288\n- Brick: (Let's assume Player 1 now has 9 Brick): 9 * 21 = 189\n- Ore: 5 * 36 = 180\n\n### Total Value:\n84 (Wheat) + 160 (Wood) + 288 (Sheep) + 189 (Brick) + 180 (Ore) = 901\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo enhance resources further, Player 1 should propose a trade that increases overall value. For example, offering multiple resources for high-value resources like Ore or Sheep could be beneficial.\n\n#### New Trade Offer:\nI will make a trade offer to Player 0:\n\nOffer: **[Offer: 3 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore]**\n\nWould you like to proceed with this offer or adjust it based on further strategy considerations? \n\nPlease let me know how to continue!",
