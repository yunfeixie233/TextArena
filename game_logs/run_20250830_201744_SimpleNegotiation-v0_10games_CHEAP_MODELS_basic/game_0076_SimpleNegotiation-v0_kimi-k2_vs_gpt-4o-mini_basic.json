      "response": "Based on my current inventory (Ore=20, Brick=17, Wood=17, Sheep=15, Wheat=8) and the fact that Brick is my most valuable resource at 26 per unit, I see that Player 1 is willing to trade Sheep for Brick unequally (5 Sheep for 5 Brick). This trade would lose me value.\n\nI'm already overtly rejecting these offers. Since rounds have been passing and I'm not initiating offers, I'll make a counter-offer that lets me acquire even more Brick.\n\nI'll offer elements that have less value to me (Sheep/Sheep first) to get more Brick:\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 6 Brick, 1 Wheat]",
