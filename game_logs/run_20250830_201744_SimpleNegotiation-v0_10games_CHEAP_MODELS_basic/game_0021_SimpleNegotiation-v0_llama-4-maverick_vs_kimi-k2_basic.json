      "response": "### Initial Assessment\n\nTo maximize the total value of my resources, I need to understand the current total value and identify potential trades that could increase it. \n\n1. **Calculate Current Total Value:**\n   - Wheat: 25 * 5 = 125\n   - Wood: 8 * 10 = 80\n   - Sheep: 10 * 17 = 170\n   - Brick: 9 * 23 = 207\n   - Ore: 10 * 37 = 370\n\n   Total Value = 125 + 80 + 170 + 207 + 370 = 952\n\n2. **Identify Potential Trades:**\n   To increase the total value, I should look to trade resources that are relatively less valuable for those that are more valuable. Given the values, trading away resources like Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 10) for other resources could be beneficial if the exchange rate is favorable.\n\n### First Turn Strategy\n\nFor the first turn, I will start by making an offer that attempts to exchange lower-value resources for higher-value ones or at least not decrease the total value significantly. \n\nNoticing my resources, I can see that I have a considerable amount of Wheat, which is the least valuable resource. I can try to trade some Wheat for other resources.\n\nLet's consider trading some Wheat for Wood, as it's the next least valuable resource, but I actually have more valuable resources to aim for.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\nI'll make an offer to trade Wheat for Brick, as Brick is significantly more valuable than Wheat.\n\n- '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\nThis offer is reasonable because I'm trading 5 Wheat (5 * 5 = 25 value) for 1 Brick (1 * 23 = 23 value), which isn't favorable. Let's adjust the strategy to make it more appealing or to aim for a better trade.\n\nUpon further consideration, a more strategic move might be to directly propose a trade that involves more valuable resources or to wait and see if there's an incoming offer.\n\nLet's directly aim to trade less valuable resources for more valuable ones or negotiate based on incoming offers.\n\n### Revised Action for Turn 1\n\nLet's make a more strategic initial offer:\n- '[Offer: 10 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis involves trading resources of total value (10*5 + 1*10 = 60) for 1 Ore (1*37 = 37), which still doesn't seem ideal due to the imbalance in the trade. \n\n### Final Action for Turn 1\n\nSince the above trades are not very appealing, let's try to initiate a different kind of trade or wait for the opponent's move.\n\nFor Turn 1, I will:\n- '[Offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Sheep]'\n\nThis trade involves exchanging 4 Wood (4*10 = 40) for 2 Sheep (2*17 = 34), which is not advantageous. However, let's adjust our strategy to be more flexible.\n\nLet's actually start with a simpler, less risky offer:\n- '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'\n\nThis trade gives away 5 Wheat (5*5 = 25) for 1 Sheep (1*17 = 17), still not ideal.\n\n### Actual First Turn\n\nGiven the constraints and aiming to initiate a trade, my actual first turn will be to make an offer that is somewhat reasonable and open to negotiation.\n\n- '[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n\nLet's see how the game unfolds.\n\n### Response\n\nI'll be waiting for the opponent's response to my offer or for an incoming offer. \n\nSince I have made an offer, I will wait for the opponent's response.\n\n### Next Step Depends on Opponent's Action\n\nAfter making the offer, I will proceed based on the opponent's response.\n\n(Please provide the opponent's response or the next game state.)",

      "response": "## Step 1: Review the current state of resources\nThe current resources and their values are: Wheat (Qty: 25, Value: 5), Wood (Qty: 8, Value: 10), Sheep (Qty: 10, Value: 17), Brick (Qty: 9, Value: 23), Ore (Qty: 10, Value: 37).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total value of current resources\nTo understand the starting point, we calculate the total value: (25*5) + (8*10) + (10*17) + (9*23) + (10*37) = 125 + 80 + 170 + 207 + 370 = 952.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze previous trade offers and their outcomes\nPrevious offers made by Player 0: \n- 5 Wheat for 1 Brick (rejected)\n- 4 Wheat for 1 Ore (rejected)\n- 6 Wheat for 1 Ore (rejected)\n- 2 Wheat for 1 Ore (rejected)\n- 7 Wheat for 1 Ore (rejected)\n\nPrevious offers received from Player 1:\n- 5 Wood, 3 Sheep for 4 Brick, 1 Sheep (rejected by Player 0)\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the last offer received from Player 1\nThe last offer from Player 1 was: 5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 4 Brick, 1 Sheep. Let's analyze it.\n- Offered: 5 Wood (Value: 5*10 = 50), 3 Sheep (Value: 3*17 = 51), Total = 101.\n- Requested: 4 Brick (Value: 4*23 = 92), 1 Sheep (Value: 1*17 = 17), Total = 109.\nThe offer is not favorable because it results in a net loss of value (109 - 101 = 8).\n\n## Step 5: Consider a new trade offer\nGiven that Ore is the most valuable resource and we have been trying to get more Ore, we should continue to aim for Ore. However, our previous offers to get Ore have been rejected. Let's consider what we can offer for Ore.\n\n## Step 6: Determine a reasonable offer for Ore\nWe have tried offering Wheat for Ore with quantities ranging from 2 to 7 Wheat. The highest value we offered was 7 Wheat (Value: 7*5 = 35) for 1 Ore (Value: 37), which is still less than the value of 1 Ore. Let's think about other resources we can offer.\n\n## Step 7: Explore alternative resources to offer for Ore\nWe could offer a combination of resources for Ore. For example, offering some of our less valuable resources or a combination that still gives us a positive or minimal negative value change.\n\n## Step 8: Formulate a new offer\nLet's consider offering some Wheat and another resource for Ore. For instance, offering 3 Wheat (Value: 15) and 1 Sheep (Value: 17), Total = 32, for 1 Ore (Value: 37). This is a potential offer because we're offering resources worth 32 for something worth 37.\n\n## Step 9: Decide on the new offer\nLet's make the offer: [Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore].\n\n## Step 10: Format the offer according to the game's special tokens\nThe offer in the required format is: [Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore].\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
