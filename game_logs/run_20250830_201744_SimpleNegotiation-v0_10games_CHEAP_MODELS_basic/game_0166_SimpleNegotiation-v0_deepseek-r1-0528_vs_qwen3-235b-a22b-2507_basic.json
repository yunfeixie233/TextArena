This suggests Player 1 may be hesitant to trade high-value resources like Ore and Brick, or has specific needs. My goal is to increase the total value of my resources by trading in a way that gives me a net gain.\n\nAnalyzing my resources:\n- Wheat (13, value 5) and Wood (18, value 8) are low-value items, making them less attractive for direct high-value trades.\n- Sheep (6, value 14) is mid-value, so I'll prioritize using it to target higher-value resources like Ore (value 32) or Brick (value 21).\n- Brick (12, value 21) is abundant, so I don't need more unless it's part of a high-gain deal.\n- Ore (13, value 32) is the most valuable, so acquiring more Ore would benefit me most.\n\nTo maximize value, I'll aim for a trade where I give resources with lower average value and receive higher-value ones. A simple 2 Sheep for 1 Ore offer is reasonable:\n- I give 28 in value (2 \u00d7 14) and receive 32 in value (1 \u00d7 32), netting a gain of 4.\n- It's less aggressive than my last offer (which had a higher gain but was rejected), so Player 1 might accept.\n\nThis trade leverages my Sheep surplus and focuses on Ore, which is worth pursuing. I'll proceed with this offer.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
