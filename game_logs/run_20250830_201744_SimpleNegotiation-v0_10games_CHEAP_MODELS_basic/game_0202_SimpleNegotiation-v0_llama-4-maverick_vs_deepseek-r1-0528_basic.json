      "response": "I'm Player 0 in the Negotiation Game. My goal is to increase the total value of my resources through trading with my opponent over 10 turns.\n\nFirst, let's assess my current resources and their values:\n- Wheat: 8 units, Value: 6\n- Wood: 7 units, Value: 9\n- Sheep: 17 units, Value: 14\n- Brick: 22 units, Value: 25\n- Ore: 8 units, Value: 40\n\nTo maximize my total value, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. \n\nLet's start by making an initial offer. I notice that Ore has the highest value per unit, and I have 8 units of it. However, I need to be cautious about depleting my resources too much.\n\nUpon reviewing my resources, I see that I have a relatively high quantity of Brick and Sheep. Ore is highly valued, but giving away too much of it might not be strategic. I should look for an opportunity to gain more Ore or retain what I have while acquiring other valuable resources.\n\nFor my first turn, I'll make an offer that involves resources I have in abundance and try to get something of higher or comparable value. I have 22 Bricks, and while Brick is valuable, I can afford to part with a few if it means getting something of higher value.\n\nLet's consider offering some Brick for Ore, as Ore is my most valuable resource per unit, and acquiring more would be beneficial.\n\nMy offer: `[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore]`\n\nThis offer gives away 5 Bricks (Value: 25 * 5 = 125) for 2 Ore (Value: 40 * 2 = 80). While it doesn't seem immediately beneficial in terms of total value (since 125 is greater than 80), it's a starting point. However, upon reevaluation, making such a trade might not be the best initial strategy since it results in a loss.\n\nLet's rethink: Offering Sheep for Ore could be more balanced. Sheep is valued at 14, and Ore at 40.\n\nAlternative offer: `[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 3 Sheep, Value: 14*3 = 42 -> 1 Ore, Value: 40*1 = 40]`. This is not a good trade for me as it results in a slight loss.\n\nLet's adjust our strategy: How about offering Wheat or Wood for Ore? Both are less valuable than Sheep, so losing them might be more acceptable if it means gaining Ore.\n\nLet's try: `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis means: `[Offer: 4 Wood, Value: 9*4 = 36 -> 1 Ore, Value: 40]`. This trade actually gains me 4 in value.\n\nSo, my first action is: `[Offer: 4 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.",

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first assess the current state of our resources and the outcome of the previous trade.\n\nInitially, we had:\n- Wheat: 8 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 7 (Value: 9)\n- Sheep: 17 (Value: 14)\n- Brick: 22 (Value: 25)\n- Ore: 8 (Value: 40)\n\nWe made an offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore\n\nAfter the trade:\n- We gave away 5 Brick, so Brick: 22 - 5 = 17\n- We received 2 Ore, so Ore: 8 + 2 = 10\n\nThus, our current resources are:\n- Wheat: 8 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 7 (Value: 9)\n- Sheep: 17 (Value: 14)\n- Brick: 17 (Value: 25)\n- Ore: 10 (Value: 40)\n\nLet's calculate the total value of our resources before and after the trade to understand the impact of the trade.\n- Initial total value = (8*6) + (7*9) + (17*14) + (22*25) + (8*40) = 48 + 63 + 238 + 550 + 320 = 1219\n- After trade total value = (8*6) + (7*9) + (17*14) + (17*25) + (10*40) = 48 + 63 + 238 + 425 + 400 = 1174\n\nThe trade resulted in a decrease in total value (from 1219 to 1174), which might not be ideal. However, having more Ore could be beneficial for future trades if we can get higher-value resources.\n\nNow, let's analyze our current resources and think about a potential next trade. We need to identify resources we can offer that are less valuable to us relative to what we might receive.\n\nGiven:\n- Ore is very valuable to us (Value: 40), and we have increased our quantity.\n- We still have a good amount of Sheep and Brick.\n\nPotential trades could involve offering resources that are relatively less valuable to us in exchange for more valuable resources.\n\nOne strategy is to offer some of our Sheep (Value: 14) or Wood (Value: 9) for something more valuable. For instance, offering Sheep for Ore might not be ideal since we just received Ore. However, offering some Brick or Sheep for a resource like Wood isn't likely to increase our total value much unless we get a very good deal.\n\nLet's consider making an offer that could potentially increase our total value. For example, offering some Brick (Value: 25) or Sheep (Value: 14) for a more valuable resource.\n\nA possible trade could be: '[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'. This trade involves giving away 4 Sheep (total value = 4*14 = 56) for 1 Ore (value = 1*40 = 40). This isn't a good trade for us as it decreases our total value.\n\nLet's think of a better offer: '[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]' is not a good idea because we're giving away (3*9 + 2*14) = 27 + 28 = 55 for (2*40) = 80, which actually could be considered. The calculation is (3*9) + (2*14) = 27 + 28 = 55 for 80, so it's a gain.\n\nThus, a reasonable offer could be: '[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]'.\n\nMy response is: [Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

Player 0 made no new offer.\n5. Player 1 offered 1 Ore for 4 Sheep, and it was accepted.\n   - Sheep: 13 - 4 = 9\n   - Ore: 11 + 1 = 12\n6. Player 0 offered 1 Ore for 4 Sheep, and it was rejected.\n7. Player 1 offered 1 Ore for 5 Sheep.\n\nCurrent Resources after the trades:\n- Wheat: 8\n- Wood: 7\n- Sheep: 9\n- Brick: 17\n- Ore: 12\n\nLet's evaluate the current situation:\n- The total initial value = (8*6) + (7*9) + (17*14) + (22*25) + (8*40) = 48 + 63 + 238 + 550 + 320 = 1219\n- The total current value = (8*6) + (7*9) + (9*14) + (17*25) + (12*40) = 48 + 63 + 126 + 425 + 480 = 1142\n\nAfter the trades so far, the total value of resources has decreased from 1219 to 1142.\n\nNow, let's analyze the last offer made by Player 1: Offered items: 1 Ore -> Requested items: 5 Sheep.\n\nIf we accept this offer:\n- Sheep: 9 - 5 = 4\n- Ore: 12 + 1 = 13\n- New total value = (8*6) + (7*9) + (4*14) + (17*25) + (13*40) = 48 + 63 + 56 + 425 + 520 = 1112\n\nAccepting this offer would further decrease our total value, so it's not beneficial.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. We could offer some Brick (lower value compared to Ore) for more Sheep or other resources.\n2. We need to focus on increasing the total value.\n\nCurrent holdings and their total values:\n- Sheep: 9 (Value: 14) = 9*14 = 126\n- Ore: 12 (Value: 40) = 12*40 = 480\n\nConsidering the values, let's make an offer that could potentially increase our total value. Since Ore is very valuable, we should try not to give it away. Let's offer some Sheep for Ore, as we've done before, or consider other less valuable resources for Ore or more valuable resources.\n\nLet's make an offer: [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nThis translates to: [Offer: 3 Sheep,  -> 1 Ore]\n\nFormat for the offer: [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nLet's send: [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
