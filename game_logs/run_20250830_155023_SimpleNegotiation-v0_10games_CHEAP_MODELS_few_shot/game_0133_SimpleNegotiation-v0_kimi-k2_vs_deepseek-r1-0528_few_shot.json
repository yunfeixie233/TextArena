Giving 1 Sheep (Value 16) and receiving 5 Wood (5*12=60) and 5 Wheat (5*5=25) totals 85, which seems like a lot, but it's unclear if we want more Wheat/Wood. Likely rejected because Wheat is low-value.\n\n2. **Turn 2**: No new offers, Player 1 rejected our (implied) lack of offer.\n\n3. **Turn 3**:\n   - Player 1 offered: 3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore.\n   - **Rejected**: 3 Wood (36) for 1 Ore (40). This is slightly worse for us (lose 4 value), but Ore is high-value and scarce, so acceptable rejection.\n\n4. **Turn 4**: No new offers, Player 1 rejected our lack of offer.\n\n5. **Turn 5**:\n   - Player 1 offered: 2 Wood \u2192 1 Brick.\n   - **Accepted**: 2 Wood (24) for 1 Brick (20). This is a net loss of 4 value, but we have excess Brick (22 brick is a lot), and Wood is more flexible here. Accepting might have been to balance resources.\n\n   After acceptance:\n   - Wood: 16 - 2 = 14\n   - Brick: 22 + 1 = 23\n   - New totals recalculated slightly, but not huge.\n\n6. **Turn 6**: No new offers, Player 1 rejected our lack of offer.\n\n7. **Turn 7**:\n   - Player 1 offered: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore.\n   - **Rejected**: 1 Sheep (16) + 1 Wood (12) = 28 for 1 Ore (40). Net gain of 12, but this seems like a good deal. Maybe Ore is scarce for them, but we already have low Ore (14), and we're trying to accumulate high-value items. The rejection might be to hoard Ore.\n\n8. **Turn 8**: No new offers, Player 1 rejected our lack of offer.\n\n9. **Turn 9**:\n   - Player 1 offered: 4 Wood \u2192 2 Brick.\n   - **Currently evaluating**: 4 Wood (4*12=48) for 2 Brick (2*20=40). Net loss of 8 value, and we have 23 Brick which is already high. Probably should **reject**.\n\n### Current Evaluation:\n- Ore is our highest value item (40), and we have 14. Getting more Ore is very valuable.\n- Brick is second highest (20), but we have 23 which is already excessive.\n- Wood (12) and Sheep (16) are mid-value, but we have plenty (14 Wood and 22 Sheep).\n- Wheat is lowest (5), and we have 18, which might be more than needed.\n\n### Best Strategy:\nWe should try to trade **low-value wheat/wood for high-value Ore or Brick**, but Brick is already high. Ideally, we'd give Wheat or Wood to get Ore.\n\n### Making an Offer as Player 0:\nLet's propose a trade where we give our lowest-value item (Wheat) to get Ore.\n\nCurrent Wheat: 18, Ore: 14.\n\nPropose: **[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]**\n- 5 Wheat (25) + 2 Wood (24) = 49 for 2 Ore (80). Net gain of 31 for us, seems good for both since Wheat is low-value.\n\n### Final Decision:\nGiven the context, Player 0 should now make an offer to improve their high-value resources.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
