So Wood for P1 increased.)\n\nLet's re-evaluate after the *previous* accepted trade, then consider the current offer.\n\n**Initial Resources (before any trades):**\n*   Wheat: 9 (Value: 5)\n*   Wood: 6 (Value: 9)\n*   Sheep: 21 (Value: 12)\n*   Brick: 21 (Value: 23)\n*   Ore: 22 (Value: 34)\n\n**Previous Trade (Player 0 offered: 3 Ore, 5 Wood -> Player 0 requested: 6 Brick, 1 Sheep). Player 1 accepted.**\nThis means Player 1 GIVES 6 Brick and 1 Sheep (to Player 0) and Player 1 RECEIVES 3 Ore and 5 Wood (from Player 0).\n\n**Player 1's Resources AFTER previous trade:**\n*   Wheat: 9 (still 9)\n*   Wood: 6 + 5 = 11\n*   Sheep: 21 - 1 = 20\n*   Brick: 21 - 6 = 15\n*   Ore: 22 + 3 = 25\n\n**Current offer from Player 0: Offered items: 6 Wood, 2 Wheat -> Requested items: 5 Ore, 2 Brick**\n\n**Analyze current offer for Player 1:**\n*   **Items Player 1 gives up (Requested by Player 0):** 5 Ore, 2 Brick\n    *   Value given up = (5 * 34) + (2 * 23) = 170 + 46 = 216\n*   **Items Player 1 gains (Offered by Player 0):** 6 Wood, 2 Wheat\n    *   Value gained = (6 * 9) + (2 * 5) = 54 + 10 = 64\n\nNet value change for Player 1 = Value gained - Value given up = 64 - 216 = -152.\n\nThis is a bad trade for Player 1. I should deny it.\n\nNow, I need to make an offer. My goal is to increase my total value.\nMy current resources:\n*   [Wheat]   Qty: 9    Value: 5   (Total 45)\n*   [Wood]    Qty: 11   Value: 9   (Total 99)\n*   [Sheep]   Qty: 20   Value: 12  (Total 240)\n*   [Brick]   Qty: 15   Value: 23  (Total 345)\n*   [Ore]     Qty: 25   Value: 34  (Total 850)\nTotal value: 45 + 99 + 240 + 345 + 850 = 1579\n\nLet's try to trade away lower-value items for higher-value ones, or items I have in abundance for something I need or that is more valuable.\nI have a lot of Ore and Sheep. Ore is high value. Sheep is medium value.\nBrick is also high value. Wheat and Wood are low value.\n\nHow about trading some abundant Sheep for more valuable Brick or Ore?\nOr trading some of my lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for higher-value ones.\n\nLet's propose something that is slightly favorable to me, but not too greedy, to see if Player 0 accepts.\nMaybe trading some Sheep and Wheat for Brick.\n\nConsider:\nOffer: 5 Sheep, 2 Wheat (5*12 + 2*5 = 60 + 10 = 70)\nRequest: 3 Brick (3*23 = 69)\nThis is close to even. I gain 1 value. Player 0 also might find this appealing if they need Sheep/Wheat.\n\nLet's try to slightly improve it for myself.\nOffer: 5 Sheep, 2 Wheat (Value: 70)\nRequest: 1 Ore (Value: 34) and 1 Brick (Value: 23). Total 57. Bad for me.\n\nWhat if I trade away some high-quantity less valuable resources for a high-value resource?\nI have 20 Sheep.\nIf I offer 4 Sheep (4*12 = 48) for 1 Ore (1*34 = 34). This is bad for me.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore or Brick.\n\nConsider trading:\nMy offer: X Sheep, Y Wood -> Z Ore\nMy available:\nWheat: 9 (5)\nWood: 11 (9)\nSheep: 20 (12)\nBrick: 15 (23)\nOre: 25 (34)\n\nTry to turn Wood into Ore.\nOffer: 6 Wood (6*9 = 54)\nRequest: 1 Ore (1*34 = 34) and 1 Wheat (1*5 = 5) and 1 Sheep (1*12 = 12). Total 51. I lose 3.\n\nLet's try to simplify. Offer a chunk of cheap items for one valuable item.\nOffer: 10 Wood (10*9 = 90)\nRequest: 4 Brick (4*23 = 92)\nThis gains me 2 value. I have 11 Wood, so this is possible. It also gives Player 0 a good quantity of Wood.\n\nPlayer 0's earlier offer was 6 Wood, 2 Wheat for 5 Ore, 2 Brick. They wanted high-value items. This suggests they have low-value items.\nThey offered Wood and Wheat. This points to them having abundance of Wood and Wheat. My current offer (requesting Brick) might work.\n\nSo, first, deny the incoming offer. Then, make my own offer.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 4 Brick]",
