Initially, we had 10 Sheep and 22 Brick. After the first trade, we had 10 + 5 = 15 Sheep and 22 - 4 = 18 Brick. After the second trade, we had 15 + 5 = 20 Sheep and 18 - 4 = 14 Brick.

      "response": "Considering the previous successful trades and current resource valuation, I propose another trade that maximizes our value increase. Since we've gained significantly by trading Sheep (valued at 18 each) for Brick (valued at 28 each), and we have exactly 5 Sheep left, this opportunity remains highly profitable. Trading 5 Sheep for 4 Brick yields a net value gain of +22 (details below), aligning with our goal to accumulate value efficiently.\n\n**Trade Rationale**:\n47- We give 5 Sheep: 5 \u00d7 18 = 90\n- We receive 4 Brick: 4 \u00d7 28 = 112  \nNet gain: 112 - 90 = +22\n\n**Action**:  \n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 4 Brick]",
