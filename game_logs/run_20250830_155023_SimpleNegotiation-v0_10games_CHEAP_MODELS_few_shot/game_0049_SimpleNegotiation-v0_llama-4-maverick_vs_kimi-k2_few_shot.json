However, we need to be cautious as Ore is one of our most valuable resources.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. Trading Wheat or Wood (lower value resources) for more Brick or other higher value resources could be beneficial.\n\n### Offer\n\nConsidering the values, let's make a new offer. We have plenty of Wheat and Wood, and we could try to get more Brick or other valuable resources.\n\nLet's offer: 4 Wheat for 1 Ore (though Ore is valuable, we might get a better deal or negotiate further).\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nIf this is not acceptable, we can adjust our offer.\n\nLet's proceed with the action.\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`",

      "response": "### Current State of Resources\n\nAfter the trades, the current state of my resources is:\n\n- [Wheat]: 23 - 4 = 19\n- [Wood]: 19 - 3 = 16\n- [Sheep]: 14\n- [Brick]: 12 + 1 = 13\n- [Ore]: 18 - 2 + 1 = 17\n\n### Calculation of Total Value\n\nThe total value of my current resources is:\n- [Wheat]: 19 * 6 = 114\n- [Wood]: 16 * 9 = 144\n- [Sheep]: 14 * 16 = 224\n- [Brick]: 13 * 26 = 338\n- [Ore]: 17 * 34 = 578\n\nTotal Value = 114 + 144 + 224 + 338 + 578 = 1398\n\n### Previous Turns and Observations\n\n1. Initially, my total value was: (23*6) + (19*9) + (14*16) + (12*26) + (18*34) = 138 + 171 + 224 + 312 + 612 = 1457\n2. After the trades, the total value is 1398.\n\n### Analysis and Next Step\n\nThe total value decreased slightly from 1457 to 1398. The game is still ongoing with 5 turns remaining.\n\nTo increase the total value, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given the current resource values and my remaining quantities, here are some considerations:\n\n- I can offer Wheat or Wood (lower value resources) to get more valuable resources like Brick or Ore.\n- My next offer should be strategic, considering the remaining turns and the resources I have.\n\n### Proposed Trade Offer\n\nLet's examine possible trades:\n- Offering Wheat: I have 19 Wheat. Offering some Wheat for a more valuable resource could be beneficial.\n- Offering Wood: I have 16 Wood. This could also be used for a trade.\n\nConsidering the values, let's make an offer that could potentially increase my total value.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\n'[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis translates to: '[Offer: 3 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 1 Ore]'\n\nUsing the special token format: '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds.\n\nResponse:",
