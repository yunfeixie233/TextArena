This trade provides a clear net gain for me: Brick has a value of 30 each, so receiving 6 Brick increases my total by 180. Ore has a value of 37 each, so giving 2 Ore decreases my total by 74. This results in a net increase of +106 in my total resource value, which aligns with my objective to maximize value.
