Accepting this offer would decrease your total value.\nTherefore, you should not accept this offer.\n\nYou can make a counter-offer.\nWhat do you need/want? You have a good amount of Brick and Ore, which are high-value. You are relatively low on Wood.\nPlayer 1 seems interested in Ore. Maybe you can trade some Ore for something more valuable to you, or at a better ratio.\n\nLet's try to get more value for your Ore.\nCurrent offer is 3 Wood for 1 Ore. (Value 27 vs 34, you lose 7)\nWhat if you countered to get something more for your Ore?\nOr you can offer something else.\n\nYou have plenty of Wheat and Sheep. Maybe try to offload some of them for Wood or Brick.\nHowever, Player 1 offered Wood for Ore. So perhaps they have a surplus of Wood.\n\nLet's try to adjust the ratio for the Ore.\nInstead of 3 Wood for 1 Ore, maybe 4 Wood for 1 Ore? That would be 36 for 34, a small gain for you.\nOr, since Player 1 seems to want Ore, maybe you can ask for more valuable items for your Ore.\nLet's try to get some Brick, or even more Wood.\n\nYou have 9 Ore. Trading one for a loss is bad.\n\nLet's try to get something you value, like Wood.\nIf Player 1 wants Ore, what about offering some Wheat for Wood? Or Sheep for Wood?\nPlayer 1 seems to have Wood.\n\nHow about countering their offer for Ore?\nThey want 1 Ore. You can ask for more than 3 Wood.\nValue of 1 Ore is 34.\nValue of 3 Wood is 27.\nIf they give you 4 Wood, value is 36. This is a small gain of 2 (36-34).\nThis is a reasonable counter.\n\nHowever, given the previous offers where Player 1 seemed to want Wheat from you, maybe they value Wheat highly.\nWhat if you offered 1 Ore for 1 Brick? (34 vs 30, you lose 4) - Bad.\n\nLet's analyze the current offer again: 3 Wood for 1 Ore.\nValue of 3 Wood = 27. Value of 1 Ore = 34.\nLoss for you = 7. Deny.\n\nYou want to make a new offer that increases your value.\nYou have plenty of Wheat (23 Qty, 5 Value). You can try to trade that.\nWhat do you want? Wood, Brick, Ore are good.\nPlayer 1 offered Wood. So they might have extra Wood.\n\nLet's try to trade some of your less valuable Wheat for a more valuable resource.\nHow about offering a good amount of Wheat for some Wood?\nMaybe 5 Wheat for 1 Wood? (25 Value for 9 Value). This is bad for you.\nHow about getting rid of Sheep?\nSheep: 11 Qty, 12 Value.\n\nLet's try to get Brick or Ore, as they are high value. You have plenty of Brick and Ore, but they are good to gain.\n\nConsider making an offer that benefits you while being attractive to Player 1.\nPlayer 1 offered Wood for Ore. Maybe they need Ore for a build.\nYou have 9 Ore. You can spare some.\nHow about: 1 Ore for 2 Brick? (34 Value vs 60 Value). Too much gain for you.\n1 Ore for 1 Brick? (34 vs 30). Still a loss of 4 for you.\n\nLet's look at relative values.\nOre (34) is roughly 3.7 times Wood (9). So 1 Ore is worth 3.7 Wood.\nPlayer 1 offered 3 Wood for 1 Ore. This is bad for you.\nYou would need at least 4 Wood for 1 Ore to make a small profit (36 vs 34).\n\nLet's try to improve on their offer for Ore.\nValue of 1 Ore = 34.\nValue of 3 Wood = 27.\nValue of 4 Wood = 36. (Small gain for you)\n\nLet's make a counter offer that slightly benefits you on the Ore trade.\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Wood]\n\nLet's check the previous offers from P1:\n1 Wood -> 6 Wheat (P1 gain 9, P0 gain 30. P0 accepts this is 21 gain. But P0 denied.)\n3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep (P1 gain 15, P0 gain 12. P0 losing 3. Deny)\n3 Wood -> 1 Ore (P1 gain 27, P0 gain 34. P0 losing 7. Deny)\n\nPlayer 1 is not giving very good offers.\nYou need to be careful with your offers.\n\nIf you don't take the Ore deal, what else can you trade?\nYou have 23 Wheat (Value 5). Perhaps trade a lot of Wheat for something small and valuable.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Wood]? (50 vs 27) (Loss for you)\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Brick]? (50 vs 30) (Loss for you)\n\nWhat about offering some of your valuable Brick since you have 14?\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep]? (30 vs 24) (Loss for you)\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 4 Wheat]? (30 vs 20) (Loss for you)\n\nYou have a lot of Brick (14). Player 1 might value Brick.\nWhat if you trade Brick for Ore?\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]? (60 vs 34) (You lose too much)\n\nLet's focus on the last offer from Player 1. They offered 3 Wood for 1 Ore.\nThey seem to have Wood and want Ore.\nIf you counter with 1 Ore for 4 Wood, it's a gain of 2 for you.\nThis seems like a fair counter for a negotiation.\n\nLet's consider if you want more Wood. You have 8 Wood. Getting 4 more would be 12.\nYou have 9 Ore. Giving 1 away would leave 8.\nYour goal is to increase total value.\n(34 - 36 if you accept: -2)\nActually: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Wood] means you give 1 Ore (value 34) and get 4 Wood (value 36).\nSo value for you is +2. This is good.\n\nSo, the action should be: Reject the current offer, and make a new offer.\nYour action should be:\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Wood]",
