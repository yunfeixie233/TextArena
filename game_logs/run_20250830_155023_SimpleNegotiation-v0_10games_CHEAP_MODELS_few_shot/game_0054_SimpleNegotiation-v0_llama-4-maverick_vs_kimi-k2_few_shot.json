      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nTo start, let's analyze the current state of our resources and their values:\n- Wheat: 21 units, Value = 5\n- Wood: 9 units, Value = 12\n- Sheep: 10 units, Value = 17\n- Brick: 7 units, Value = 21\n- Ore: 16 units, Value = 37\n\nThe total value of our resources can be calculated as follows:\n- Total Value = (21 * 5) + (9 * 12) + (10 * 17) + (7 * 21) + (16 * 37)\n- Total Value = 105 + 108 + 170 + 147 + 592\n- Total Value = 1122\n\n### Strategy\n\nOur goal is to increase the total value of our resources through trades. To do this effectively, we should:\n1. Identify the resources with the highest value.\n2. Try to acquire more of the highest-value resources or maintain our current holdings of them if they are already high in value.\n3. Be willing to trade away resources with lower values if it means gaining resources with higher values.\n\nFrom the given values:\n- Ore has the highest value at 37.\n- Brick is the second-highest value resource at 21.\n- Sheep is the third-highest at 17.\n\n### Initial Trade Offer\n\nTo increase our total value, we should aim to either gain more Ore, Brick, or Sheep, or maintain our current holdings of these if possible. We can start by looking at our resources and thinking about what we can offer that might be attractive to the other player.\n\nLet's consider making an initial offer. We have a relatively large quantity of Wheat (low value) and a significant amount of Ore (high value). We could try to trade some of our Wheat or other lower-value resources for more of the higher-value resources.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some Wheat (since it's abundant and low in value) for a resource that is higher in value.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\nLet's make an initial offer:\n- We can offer 10 Wheat for 1 Ore, as Ore is the highest value resource.\n\nUsing the special token format, the offer would be:\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis action is: `[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`",

Trading Ore for other resources could be valuable since Ore is highly valued, and we have a considerable amount.\n2. We previously tried to trade Wheat for Brick. Let's consider if we have other resources to offer for Brick or other valuable resources.\n\nConsidering the values:\n- Trading 1 Ore (Value: 37) for resources could be beneficial if we get more value in return.\n- Brick is the second most valuable resource per unit after Ore. \n\nLet's think about making a new offer:\n- If we offer 1 Ore (Value: 37) for 2 Brick (Value: 21 * 2 = 42), it could be a good trade since we're gaining 5 in value.\n- However, Player 1 previously rejected an offer related to Wheat, so their preferences are not entirely clear.\n\nLet's make an offer: \n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]\n\nThis offer is reasonable because we're offering a valuable resource (Ore) in exchange for more Brick, which could potentially increase our total value if accepted.\n\nResponse:\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]",

The last trade made was 10 Wheat for 1 Ore, resulting in a gain.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the previous trades and their outcomes.\nThe previous trades were: (1) 10 Wheat for 1 Ore (accepted by Player 1), (2) 5 Wheat for 1 Brick (rejected), (3) 1 Ore for 2 Brick (rejected), (4) 2 Sheep for 1 Brick (rejected by Player 1), and then Player 1 made an offer: 2 Sheep for 1 Brick.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the current offer from Player 1.\nPlayer 1's offer is 2 Sheep for 1 Brick. To evaluate this, we need to compare the value of 2 Sheep to 1 Brick. The value of 2 Sheep is 2 * 17 = 34, and the value of 1 Brick is 21.\n\n## Step 4: Decide whether to accept or deny Player 1's offer.\nSince 2 Sheep (value: 34) is worth more than 1 Brick (value: 21), accepting this offer would decrease the total value of resources. Thus, it's not beneficial.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a response to Player 1's offer.\nGiven that the offer is not in our favor, the appropriate response is to deny it.\n\n## Step 6: Consider making a new offer.\nAfter denying Player 1's offer, we should consider making a new offer. We have tried offering Wheat, Ore, and Sheep for Brick before. Let's analyze the resources again and think about a reasonable trade. We have a lot of Wheat and Ore, and we are looking to increase our total value.\n\n## Step 7: Determine a new trade offer.\nLet's think about offering something we have in abundance or relatively low value for something of higher value. We could offer Wheat (low value) or some Wood (since we have 9, it's not extremely abundant but could be used). However, we've already tried offering Wheat. Another option could be to offer some Wood or Sheep for a more valuable resource.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the potential value gain or loss for a new offer.\nOne potential offer could be to give up some Wood (Value: 12) for Ore (Value: 37), or Sheep (Value: 17) for Ore. For example, offering 1 Wood (Value: 12) for 1 Ore (Value: 37) would be a gain.\n\n## Step 9: Formulate a new offer based on the available resources and potential gain.\nLet's offer 3 Wood for 1 Ore. The value given is 3 * 12 = 36, and the value received is 37. This is a slight gain.\n\n## Step 10: Write down the action for the current turn.\nFirst, we deny Player 1's offer: [Deny]. Then, we make a new offer: [Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore].\n\nThe final answer is: \n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Step 1: Analyze the Current State of Resources\n\nAfter the last turn, we need to assess the current state of our resources and the resources we have exchanged.\n\nInitially:\n- Wheat: 21 units, Value: 5\n- Wood: 9 units, Value: 12\n- Sheep: 10 units, Value: 17\n- Brick: 7 units, Value: 21\n- Ore: 16 units, Value: 37\n\nChanges due to trades:\n1. We offered 10 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n   - Wheat: 21 - 10 = 11\n   - Ore: 16 + 1 = 17\n\nSo, the current state:\n- Wheat: 11 units\n- Wood: 9 units\n- Sheep: 10 units\n- Brick: 7 units\n- Ore: 17 units\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Previous Offers and Counteroffers\n\nOur previous offers and their outcomes:\n1. Offered 10 Wheat for 1 Ore: Accepted.\n2. Offered 5 Wheat for 1 Brick: Rejected.\n3. Offered 1 Ore for 2 Brick: Rejected.\n4. Offered 2 Sheep for 1 Brick: Rejected.\n5. Received a counteroffer: 2 Sheep for 1 Brick, which we rejected.\n6. Offered 3 Wood for 1 Ore: Rejected.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Best Course of Action for the Next Turn\n\nTo maximize our resource value, we need to consider what we can offer and what we should request.\n\n1. **Evaluate the Value of Resources**:\n   - Total value currently = (11*5) + (9*12) + (10*17) + (7*21) + (17*37)\n   - Total value = 55 + 108 + 170 + 147 + 629 = 1109\n\n2. **Consider Potential Trades**:\n   - We need to identify a trade that increases our total value.\n   - Since our offers for Brick were rejected multiple times, let's consider other resources.\n   - Ore is highly valued. We already have a significant amount of Ore, so offering it might not be the best unless we get something of higher total value.\n\n3. **Potential Trade Offers**:\n   - Consider offering Wheat (low value) or Wood (moderate value) for other resources.\n   - We could offer Sheep or Brick if we can get Ore or something of higher value in return.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate a Trade Offer\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- Offering Wheat or Wood for higher-value resources could be beneficial.\n- Our last offer of 3 Wood for 1 Ore was rejected. Let's adjust this offer.\n\n### Step 5: Make a Trade Offer\n\nConsidering our resources and the need to increase our total value, let's make a new offer.\n\nWe have:\n- Wheat: 11 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 9 (Value: 12)\n- Sheep: 10 (Value: 17)\n- Brick: 7 (Value: 21)\n- Ore: 17 (Value: 37)\n\nLet's offer 4 Wood for 1 Ore (since 3 Wood for 1 Ore was rejected, we're increasing the quantity offered).\n\nValue given: 4 * 12 = 48\nValue received: 1 * 37 = 37\n\nThis isn't a good trade for us since 48 > 37. Let's think of another resource.\n\nLet's consider: Offer 2 Sheep (2*17 = 34) for 1 Ore (1*37 = 37). This is a slightly positive trade.\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
