First, let's calculate the current total value of my resources:\n   - Wheat: 24 * 6 = 144\n   - Wood: 5 * 10 = 50\n   - Sheep: 6 * 14 = 84\n   - Brick: 14 * 22 = 308\n   - Ore: 22 * 36 = 792\n   Total value = 144 + 50 + 84 + 308 + 792 = 1,378\n\n2. Now, let's analyze the value per unit of each resource to understand what to prioritize:\n   - Wheat: 6\n   - Wood: 10\n   - Sheep: 14\n   - Brick: 22\n   - Ore: 36\n   Ore is the most valuable per unit, followed by brick, sheep, wood, and wheat.\n\n3. Since Ore and Brick are the most valuable, I should aim to accumulate more of them. Wheat and Wood are the least valuable, so they would be good candidates to trade away.\n\n4. Looking at my quantities:\n   - I have 24 Wheat (way more than needed for its low value)\n   - I have 5 Wood (low quantity but also low value)\n   - Sheep is moderate (6 units)\n   - Brick is good (14 units)\n   - Ore is high (22 units)\n\n5. A good strategy would be to offer Wheat/Wood for Brick/Ore/Sheep to increase total value.\n\n6. Let's make an initial offer that gives away low-value resources for higher-value ones:\n   - Offer 6 Wheat (value 36) for 2 Brick (value 44)\n   - This would be a net gain of 8 in value.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",
