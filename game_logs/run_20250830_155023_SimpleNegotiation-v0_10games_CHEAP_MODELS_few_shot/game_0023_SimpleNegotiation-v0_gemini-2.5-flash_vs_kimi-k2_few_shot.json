This is bad for me.\nThe previous offer was 8 Sheep for 1 Ore (144 value for 40 value). Still bad for me relative to just keeping 8 Sheep.\n\nI need to make an offer where the value of what I give is less than what I get.\nPlayer 1 offered (2 Sheep, 2 Wood) for (2 Ore). Value out: 54. Value in: 80.\nSo Player 1 is looking to gain value.\n\nLet's try to trade some Sheep and Wood for Brick. Brick is 20, so 2 Brick is 40.\n\nWhat if I offer some Sheep and possibly some Wood for good value?\nCurrent resources total value: 9*5 + 7*9 + 25*18 + 12*20 + 10*40 = 45 + 63 + 450 + 240 + 400 = 1198.\n\nI'm low on Wheat and relatively low on Wood.\nI have a ton of Sheep.\n\nLet's make an offer for 1 Ore.\nWhat if I offer 2 Sheep and 1 Wood for 1 Ore?\n2 Sheep (36) + 1 Wood (9) = 45. 1 Ore = 40. This means I'd lose 5 value. I want to gain.\n\nLet's try to make an offer where I sacrifice a resource I have in abundance (Sheep) for a more valuable one.\nMy last offer: 8 Sheep -> 1 Ore (rejected). Value out: 144. Value in: 40. This was a bad offer from my side.\n\nLet's offer something more appealing to Player 1.\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore and ask for a lot of Sheep back? This is not in line with my goal of increasing value.\n\nMy goal is to increase my total resource value. Ore and Brick are good choices.\n\nLet's make this offer:\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]\nThe value of 3 Sheep is 3 * 18 = 54. The value of 1 Wood is 1 * 9 = 9. Total offered value = 63.\nThe value of 1 Brick is 20. This is still not good for me.\n\nI need to focus on getting more value than I give up.\nLet's try to get Ore again, as it's the highest value.\nIf I give 2 Sheep (36) and get 1 Ore (40), I gain 4 value. This could be a good trade for me, assuming Player 1 thinks 2 Sheep is worth less to them than 1 Ore.\n\nLet's try this.\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue out: 2 * 18 = 36. Value in: 1 * 40 = 40. I gain 4 value. This is a very small gain, but a gain nonetheless.\nPlayer 1 was offering 2 Sheep and 2 Wood for 2 Ore (54 value for 80 value -- a gain of 26 for them per 80 value, or 13 per 40 value).\nSo, if I offer 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, I am offering significantly less than what Player 1 asked for (they asked for 2 Sheep and 2 Wood for 2 Ore, which implies they value 1 Ore at 1 Sheep and 1 Wood -- so 18+9=27 from their side; but they want 2 Ore for 2 Sheep and 2 Wood), meaning my offer (36 for 40) might be acceptable to them if they need Sheep and value Ore slightly less than I do.\n\nLet's propose:\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
