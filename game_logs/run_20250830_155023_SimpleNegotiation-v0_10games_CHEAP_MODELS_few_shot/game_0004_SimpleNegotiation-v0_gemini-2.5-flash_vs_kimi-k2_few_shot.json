      "response": "I will be Player 0.\nMy current resources and their values are:\n  - Wheat: 25 * 6 = 150\n  - Wood: 14 * 9 = 126\n  - Sheep: 19 * 17 = 323\n  - Brick: 16 * 20 = 320\n  - Ore: 13 * 35 = 455\nTotal value = 150 + 126 + 323 + 320 + 455 = 1374.\n\nThe goal is to increase my total resource value. I should try to trade less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nLet's consider the relative values:\nWheat (6) < Wood (9) < Sheep (17) < Brick (20) < Ore (35)\n\nI have a good amount of Wheat and Wood, which are the lowest value. I want to try to trade these for higher-value resources like Ore or Brick.\n\nTurn 1: I will make an offer to Player 1.\nI want to get rid of Wheat/Wood and get Brick/Ore.\n\nHow about trading common resources for scarcer, more valuable ones?\nExample:\nValue of 1 Wheat is 6. Value of 1 Ore is 35. This is roughly 1 Ore = 6 Wheat.\nValue of 1 Wood is 9. Value of 1 Brick is 20. This is roughly 1 Brick = 2.2 Wood.\n\nI have plenty of Wheat. I will try to trade Wheat for Ore.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore] This offer is 60 value for 70 value, which is slightly beneficial for me.\nOr, I want more Brick.\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Brick] This is 45 value for 40 value. Not good for me.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 3 Ore] This is 90 value for 105 value, good for me.\n\nI will try to make an offer that feels fair to both parties, but still benefits me.\nLet's try to get Brick, which is a bit easier to trade for than Ore.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Wood.\nWhat if I offer Wheat and Wood for Brick?\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 4 Brick]\nValue of my offer: (10 * 6) + (5 * 9) = 60 + 45 = 105.\nValue of requested resources: (4 * 20) = 80.\nThis is not a good offer for me. I am giving 105 value for 80 received.\n\nLet's reverse it to benefit me more. I want to give less valuable resources and get more valuable ones.\n\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 3 Brick]\nValue Offered: 15 * 6 = 90\nValue Requested: 3 * 20 = 60\nThis also doesn't work.\n\nMy goal is to increase the value. So (Value of Offered Resources) MUST BE LESS THAN (Value of Requested Resources).\n\nLet's aim for a small, clear win.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 3 * 17 = 51\nValue requested: 1 * 35 = 35\nThis is beneficial for my opponent, not for me. I have a lot of Sheep, but it's middle-tier.\n\nI need to trade my low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for high-value resources (Brick, Ore).\n\nLet's try trading Wheat for Brick.\nWhat if I offer 5 Wheat (30V) for 2 Brick (40V)? Still not a huge gain.\n\nLet me try to trade 10 Wheat + 5 Wood for a good amount of Ore.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Ore]\nValue offered: 10*6 + 5*9 = 60 + 45 = 105\nValue requested: 3*35 = 105\nThis is a neutral offer. Not good enough.\n\nI need to be more aggressive for my gain.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 4 Ore]\nValue offered: 10*6 + 5*9 = 60 + 45 = 105\nValue requested: 4*35 = 140\nThis is a good offer for me. I give 105 value and gain 140 value, for a net gain of 35 value. I have plenty of Wheat and Wood.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 4 Ore]",
