      "response": "My assessment of the current state of the game:\n\nPlayer 0 (Me):\n- Resources:\n    - Wheat: 10 (Value: 6)\n    - Wood: 21 (Value: 9)\n    - Sheep: 22 (Value: 13)\n    - Brick: 6 (Value: 26)\n    - Ore: 13 (Value: 36)\n- Previous Action: Offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore. This offer was rejected by Player 1.\n- Player 1 did not make a new trade offer.\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Ore is my most valuable resource per unit, so acquiring more of it is generally good. Sheep is relatively less valuable than Brick or Ore.\n\nThe previous offer (2 Sheep for 1 Ore) involved me giving up resources with a total value of 2 * 13 = 26, to gain resources with a total value of 1 * 36 = 36. This would have been a net gain of 10 value. It was a reasonable offer from my perspective, but Player 1 rejected it. This suggests Player 1 either values Sheep more highly than I do, or values Ore less highly than I do, or perhaps they simply don't have surplus Ore they want to trade for Sheep.\n\nSince Player 1 made no new offer, I need to initiate another one. I should consider what Player 1 might want. Without knowing Player 1's resources, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nPossibilities for a new offer:\n1.  **Modify the previous offer**: Perhaps 2 Sheep for 1 Ore was too much for Player 1. I could try 3 Sheep for 1 Ore (Value: 39 for 36). This is a slight loss for me in terms of direct value-for-value but might be more appealing to Player 1 if they are sheep-poor or ore-rich. However, my goal is to *increase* my value, so making a losing trade is not ideal unless it's a strategically necessary setup for a later very profitable trade.\n2.  **Offer something else for Ore**: What if Player 1 doesn't want Sheep? I have a decent amount of Wheat and Wood. Wood (Value 9) is my cheapes resource after Wheat.\n    *   What about 3 Wood for 1 Ore? (Value: 27 for 36). This is a good value trade for me if accepted (net gain of 9).\n    *   What about 4 Wheat for 1 Ore? (Value: 24 for 36). Also a good value trade for me (net gain of 12).\n3.  **Offer for Brick**: Brick is also a high-value resource. I have little of it (6 units).\n    *   2 Sheep for 1 Brick? (Value: 26 for 26). This is a break-even value-wise, but it converts Sheep (lower value) into Brick (higher value per unit). Might be good.\n    *   3 Wood for 1 Brick? (Value: 27 for 26). Slight value loss.\n    *   2 Wood for 1 Brick? (Value: 18 for 26). Good value gain for me.\n\nGiven Player 1 rejected my previous offer, I should try to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me but *also* potentially more attractive to Player 1 from their side, perhaps by offering a resource they might need more or at a slightly better rate for them than my previous offer, without compromising my goal of increasing overall value.\n\nLet's try a different resource. Perhaps Player 1 needs Wood. I have 21 Wood.\nI want Ore or Brick.\n\nConsider: Offering Wood for high-value items.\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore] (My value out: 27, My value in: 36. Net gain: 9) This is a good trade for me, 3 Wood is a significant amount but worth it for Ore.\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick] (My value out: 18, My value in: 26. Net gain: 8) Also a very good trade for me.\n\nPlayer 1 might be sheep poor and want Sheep. My previous offer was 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore. Maybe they simply don't have Ore to spare, or they value their Ore very highly.\n\nLet's try offering a different lower-value resource (Wood) for Ore, as it offers a good value gain for me and diversifies my offer.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
