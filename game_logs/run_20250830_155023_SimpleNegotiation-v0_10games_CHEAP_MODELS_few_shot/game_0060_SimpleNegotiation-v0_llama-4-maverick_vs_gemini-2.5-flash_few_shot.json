      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to analyze the current situation and potential trades.\n\nInitially, I have:\n- Wheat: 13 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 19 (Value: 8)\n- Sheep: 23 (Value: 17)\n- Brick: 11 (Value: 24)\n- Ore: 14 (Value: 37)\n\nLet's calculate the total initial value:\n- Total Value = (13 * 5) + (19 * 8) + (23 * 17) + (11 * 24) + (14 * 37)\n- Total Value = 65 + 152 + 391 + 264 + 518\n- Total Value = 1390\n\nTo increase this total value, I need to make trades that give me resources of higher value or more quantity of resources that are relatively valuable.\n\nFirst, let's examine the values:\n- Ore is the most valuable (Value: 37), followed by Sheep (Value: 17), then Brick (Value: 24), Wood (Value: 8), and Wheat (Value: 5).\n\nSince it's the first turn, I don't have an incoming offer to respond to, so I will make an offer. A strategic move would be to offer resources of lower value in exchange for resources of higher value.\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (Value: 5) and Wood (Value: 8) for Sheep (Value: 17) or Ore (Value: 37), as they are more valuable.\n\nFor example, offering 5 Wheat (total value = 25) and 3 Wood (total value = 24) for 1 Ore (Value: 37) seems beneficial because I'm offering a total value of 49 for a resource worth 37, which isn't beneficial. However, if I can get a better deal, such as offering for a more valuable resource or getting more quantity, it could work.\n\nLet's directly offer something that could be considered reasonable:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]' is not a good deal for me since I'm giving (5*5 + 3*8) = 25 + 24 = 49 for 37.\n\nA potentially good trade could involve offering less valuable resources for more valuable ones. For instance:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]' because I'm giving (4*5) = 20 for (1*17) = 17. This isn't a great trade either.\n\nA more reasonable initial offer could be:\n'[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 3 Ore]'.\n\nHere, I'm offering (2*17 + 1*24) = 34 + 24 = 58 for (3*37) = 111. This is not a good trade for me as I am giving up 58 for 111.\n\nLet's think about offering resources for Brick or Sheep since they are less valuable than Ore but still relatively valuable:\n'[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick]' translates to giving (3*8) = 24 for (1*24) = 24, which is not beneficial.\n\nUpon further consideration, a more strategic initial offer might involve:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'.\n\nThis means giving (5*5) = 25 for (1*24) = 24, which is still not beneficial.\n\nLet's adjust the strategy to something like:\n'[Offer: 2 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'.\n\nThis translates to giving (2*8 + 3*5) = (16 + 15) = 31 for (1*17) = 17. Still not great.\n\nRevisiting the idea of directly trying to get more Ore or keeping the valuable resources:\n'[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' means giving 17 for 37, which is a good trade.\n\nMy first action will be:\n'[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis is a straightforward attempt to gain a more valuable resource. I'll wait for the opponent's response.\n\nAction: [Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

This was rejected.\n\nNow, Player 1 made an offer to Player 0: 5 Sheep, 10 Wood -> 2 Ore.\n\nLet's evaluate this offer:\n- You are giving away: 5 Sheep (Value: 17 * 5 = 85) and 10 Wood (Value: 8 * 10 = 80). Total value given away = 85 + 80 = 165.\n- You are receiving: 2 Ore (Value: 37 * 2 = 74).\n\nThe total value received (74) is less than the total value given away (165), making this a bad trade for you.\n\nLet's adjust the quantities to potentially make a more balanced trade or directly decide on an action.\n\nYour current quantities:\n- Wheat: 13\n- Wood: 19\n- Sheep: 23\n- Brick: 11\n- Ore: 14\n\nConsidering the values and the offer made by Player 1, a more favorable trade for you could be needed. Let's directly analyze potential counteroffers or actions.\n\n## Step 1: Evaluate the Current Offer\nPlayer 1's offer is 5 Sheep, 10 Wood -> 2 Ore. The value given away is 165, and the value received is 74, which is not favorable.\n\n## Step 2: Consider a Counteroffer\nTo make a counteroffer, we need to think about what we can give away and what we want to receive. One approach is to try to negotiate a better deal by either reducing what we give away or increasing what we receive.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Resources and Potential Trades\nYou have a significant amount of Sheep and relatively high-value Ore. A potential trade could involve Ore, but since Ore is high in value, you might want to keep as much of it as possible.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a Counteroffer\nLet's consider giving away resources that are lower in value but still significant in quantity. One possible trade could be giving away some Wood (since it's relatively lower in value) and possibly some Sheep, in exchange for Ore or other high-value resources.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on an Action\nGiven that Player 1's offer is not favorable, you could either deny the offer and make a counteroffer or accept if you think it's the best available option.\n\nLet's formulate a counteroffer: You could offer something like '[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' or a similar ratio. However, let's directly calculate a potentially more favorable trade.\n\n## Step 6: Propose a Counteroffer\nConsidering the values, a potential counteroffer could involve giving away fewer Sheep or less Wood in exchange for Ore. Let's directly propose: '[Offer: 2 Sheep, 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThis translates to:\n- Giving away: 2 Sheep (Value: 17 * 2 = 34) and 4 Wood (Value: 8 * 4 = 32). Total value given away = 34 + 32 = 66.\n- Receiving: 1 Ore (Value: 37).\n\nThis counteroffer is more balanced.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Sheep, 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]}$",
