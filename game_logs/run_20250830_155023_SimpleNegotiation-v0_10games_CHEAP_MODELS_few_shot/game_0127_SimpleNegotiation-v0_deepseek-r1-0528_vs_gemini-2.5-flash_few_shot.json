My past offens have focused on acquiring Ore (valued at 39 each) by offering Sheep (16) and Brick (22), but Player 1 rejected them even when I provided nearly equal value. It seems Player 1 is hesitant to part with Ore, so I'm offering a deal that gives them a small net gain per my valuation to entice acceptance.
