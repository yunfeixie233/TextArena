      "response": "## Step 1: Review the current state of resources after the last trade.\nAfter the last accepted trade, I (Player 1) gave 5 Wheat to Player 0 and received 2 Sheep in return. So, the updated quantities are:\n- Wheat: 10 - 5 = 5\n- Wood: 8 (no change)\n- Sheep: 5 + 2 = 7\n- Brick: 15 (no change)\n- Ore: 22 (no change)\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the current resources and their values.\nThe current resources and their values are:\n- Wheat: Qty: 5, Value: 6 (Total Value: 5*6 = 30)\n- Wood: Qty: 8, Value: 8 (Total Value: 8*8 = 64)\n- Sheep: Qty: 7, Value: 15 (Total Value: 7*15 = 105)\n- Brick: Qty: 15, Value: 27 (Total Value: 15*27 = 405)\n- Ore: Qty: 22, Value: 35 (Total Value: 22*35 = 770)\nTotal value = 30 + 64 + 105 + 405 + 770 = 1374\n\n## Step 3: Consider potential trades based on the current state and the last offer's outcome.\nThe last offer made (5 Brick -> 4 Wood) was rejected. This indicates that Player 0 may not be willing to give up 4 Wood for 5 Brick. We need to reassess the value of our resources and consider alternative trades.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the rejected offer to understand Player 0's perspective.\nThe rejected offer was 5 Brick (Value: 5*27 = 135) for 4 Wood (Value: 4*8 = 32). Player 0 likely valued the 5 Brick less than or equal to the value of 4 Wood, or was not willing to make the trade for other strategic reasons.\n\n## Step 5: Explore alternative trade offers that could be beneficial.\nTo increase the total value, we should look for trades that give us resources with higher values or more quantity of resources we can use to make future trades. One potential trade could involve offering some of our Ore (high value) or Brick (abundant) for resources like Wood (which we need more of) or Sheep.\n\n## Step 6: Propose a new trade offer.\nLet's consider offering some Ore for Wood since we have a lot of Ore and could use more Wood. For example, offering 3 Ore (Value: 3*35 = 105) for 5 Wood (Value: 5*8 = 40) could be a good start, but it's not favorable as we're giving up more value than we're getting. A more balanced trade would be needed.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a specific trade offer.\nConsider offering 2 Ore (Value: 2*35 = 70) for 4 Wood (Value: 4*8 = 32) and 1 Sheep (Value: 1*15 = 15). The total value requested is 32 + 15 = 47, which is less than the value offered (70), so this might not be favorable. Let's adjust our strategy to offer something more balanced.\n\n## Step 8: Adjust the trade offer to be more reasonable.\nLet's offer 1 Ore (Value: 35) for 4 Wood (Value: 32). This is still not very favorable. However, it's closer. We could also think about offering some Brick for Wood or Sheep.\n\n## Step 9: Consider offering Brick for Sheep or Wood.\nSince we have a lot of Brick and could use more Wood or Sheep, let's think about offering Brick for one of these. For example, 4 Brick (Value: 4*27 = 108) for 3 Sheep (Value: 3*15 = 45) is not favorable. However, 3 Brick (Value: 81) for 6 Wood (Value: 48) is also not good. Let's directly think about a reasonable offer.\n\n## Step 10: Make a new trade offer based on the analysis.\nLet's offer: [Offer: 2 Ore -> 1 Sheep, 1 Wood]. This translates to: [Offer: 2 Ore, Value: 70 -> 1 Sheep (Value: 15), 1 Wood (Value: 8)]. The total requested value is 15 + 8 = 23, which is less than 70. This is not a good trade for us. Let's think simpler.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the trade offer.\nConsider offering something like [Offer: 4 Brick -> 2 Sheep]. Here, we're offering 4 Brick (Value: 4*27 = 108) for 2 Sheep (Value: 2*15 = 30). This is not a good trade for us as we're giving up more value.\n\n## Step 12: Finalize a trade offer.\nLet's think about [Offer: 1 Ore, 2 Brick -> 4 Wood]. Here, we're offering 1 Ore (Value: 35) and 2 Brick (Value: 2*27 = 54), totaling 89 in value, for 4 Wood (Value: 4*8 = 32). This is still not favorable.\n\n## Step 13: Reconsider the initial resources and potential trades again.\nGiven that our last offer was rejected and we need to come up with a new one, let's directly propose a reasonable trade. How about [Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Wood]? This means giving up 3 Brick (Value: 3*27 = 81) for 2 Wood (Value: 2*8 = 16), which is not a good trade.\n\n## Step 14: Reflect on the game state and adjust the strategy.\nWe've made several trades and rejections. Let's simplify: We have a lot of Brick and Ore. We could offer some of these for Wood or Sheep.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Ore -> 1 Sheep, 3 Wood]}$",

      "response": "### Current Game State\n\nWe are currently in the middle of the Negotiation Game, having completed several turns. Let's analyze the current state:\n\n1. **Initial Resources and Values for Player 1:**\n   - Wheat: 10 (Value: 6)\n   - Wood: 8 (Value: 8)\n   - Sheep: 5 (Value: 15)\n   - Brick: 15 (Value: 27)\n   - Ore: 22 (Value: 35)\n\n2. **Changes Due to Trades:**\n   - Offered 5 Wheat for 2 Sheep: \n     - Lost 5 Wheat\n     - Gained 2 Sheep\n   - Offered 5 Brick for 4 Wood: \n     - Rejected, so no change\n   - Offered 2 Ore for 1 Sheep and 1 Wood: \n     - Rejected, so no change\n   - Offered 2 Brick for 2 Wood and 1 Sheep: \n     - Lost 2 Brick\n     - Gained 2 Wood and 1 Sheep\n\n3. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 10 - 5 = 5 (Value: 6)\n   - Wood: 8 + 2 = 10 (Value: 8)\n   - Sheep: 5 + 2 + 1 = 8 (Value: 15)\n   - Brick: 15 - 2 = 13 (Value: 27)\n   - Ore: 22 (Value: 35) (No change due to the last accepted offer, but previously offered 2 Ore which was rejected)\n\nLet's compute the current total value:\n- Wheat: 5 * 6 = 30\n- Wood: 10 * 8 = 80\n- Sheep: 8 * 15 = 120\n- Brick: 13 * 27 = 351\n- Ore: 22 * 35 = 770\n\nTotal Value = 30 + 80 + 120 + 351 + 770 = 1351\n\n### Next Move\n\nTo decide the next move, we need to consider what resources we have and what we can offer to increase our total value. Given the current distribution:\n- We have a good amount of Ore, Brick, and Sheep.\n- The value of Ore is high, but we have a substantial quantity.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. **Offering Ore:** Since we have a lot of Ore and its value is high, offering some Ore for other resources could be beneficial if we get a good deal.\n2. **Utilizing Surplus:** We have a surplus of Brick and Ore. We could offer some of these for other resources that might increase our total value.\n\n### Potential Trade Offers\n\n1. **Offer 2 Ore for 1 Sheep and 2 Wood:**\n   - We have plenty of Ore, and Sheep and Wood are relatively valuable.\n\n2. **Offer 3 Brick for 2 Wood:**\n   - Brick is valuable, and we have a good amount. Trading some for Wood could be beneficial.\n\nLet's propose a trade that could potentially increase our total value. Considering our resources and the previous successful trade (2 Brick for 2 Wood and 1 Sheep), a similar or slightly different offer might be accepted.\n\n### Action\n\nLet's make a new offer: `[Offer: 3 Brick, 1 Ore -> 4 Wood, 1 Sheep]`\n\nThis offer is based on the following reasoning:\n- We are offering 3 Brick (Value: 3*27 = 81) and 1 Ore (Value: 35), totaling 116.\n- We are requesting 4 Wood (Value: 4*8 = 32) and 1 Sheep (Value: 15), totaling 47.\n- This is not a good trade for us as it reduces our total value. Let's reconsider.\n\nReconsidering, let's adjust our offer to be more balanced or beneficial:\n`[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Wood]`\n\nThis simplifies the offer and focuses on Ore for Wood, which might be more appealing.\n\nLet's go with: `[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Wood]`\n\n### Output\n\n`[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Wood]`",
