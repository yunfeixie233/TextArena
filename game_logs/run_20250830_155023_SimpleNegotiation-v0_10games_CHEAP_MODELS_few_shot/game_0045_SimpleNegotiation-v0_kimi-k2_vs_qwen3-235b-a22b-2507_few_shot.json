Moving it for other things often pays off because of its premium value.\n- Wood (12) and Wheat (5) are plentiful but cheap, so dumping them for anything worth more is attractive.\n- Sheep at 15 each is decent, but we have a modest, not stock-piled, amount (7).\n\nMy opening strategy: trade one of our plentiful, high-value Ores for Brick\u2014the scarcest and best-value card.\n\n[Offer: 3 Ore -> 3 Brick]",
