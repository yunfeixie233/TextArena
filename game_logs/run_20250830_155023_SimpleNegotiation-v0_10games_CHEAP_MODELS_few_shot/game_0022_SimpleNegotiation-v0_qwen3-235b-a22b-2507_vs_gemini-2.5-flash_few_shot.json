I need to make a new offer that is more appealing to them, while still benefiting myself.\nMy last offer: 5 Wheat (30) + 3 Wood (30) -> 2 Ore (70). This was an offer that was slightly in my favor.\nGiven Player 0 rejected it, they likely need resources that are more valuable to them, or they found the trade unfair from their perspective.\n\nLet's re-evaluate my needs and Player 0's potential needs based on recent offers.\nPlayer 0 previously offered:\n- 10 Sheep (170), 5 Wood (50) -> 5 Brick (135), 3 Wheat (18)\n- 8 Ore (280), 4 Wheat (24) -> 6 Brick (162), 2 Wood (20)\n\nPlayer 0 seems to be interested in Brick. They offered a lot of their resources to get Brick.\nI have 13 Brick and 351 value. Maybe I can leverage this.\n\nMy goal is to increase my total value. Ore is high value. Brick is high value.\nI have a lot of Sheep and Wood, which are lower value per unit. Wheat is also low value.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore or Brick, or trade away lower value items for higher value items.\n\nWhat if I offer some Brick, but get a good return?\nI have Wheat and Wood in quantity.\n\nCurrent strategy:\n1. Offer lower value resources for higher value resources.\n2. Consider offering something that Player 0 has expressed interest in (Brick) but ensure the trade is profitable for me.\n\nLet's try to get Ore, as it's the highest value resource I have.\nI need to make sure the trade is attractive for Player 0 given their rejections.\n\nHow about I offer Brick and some lower value items for Ore?\nFor example, if I offer 1 Brick (27), I want at least that value back, ideally more in a high-value resource.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (81), I could ask for 2 Ore (70) and something else, maybe Sheep or Wood. But 2 Ore for 3 Brick is bad for me.\n\nLet's look at it from Player 0's side:\nThey valued 6 Brick at around 8 Ore + 4 Wheat, or 5 Brick at 10 Sheep + 5 Wood.\nThis suggests they value Brick quite highly.\n\nLet's try to get Ore by offering some Wood/Wheat.\nMy previous offer: 5 Wheat (30), 3 Wood (30) -> 2 Ore (70) was rejected. Value difference of 10.\nMaybe I need to offer bigger quantities to make it more appealing or balance the value better.\n\nWhat if I offer a larger quantity of cheaper goods, for a smaller quantity of expensive goods?\nI have lots of Sheep and Wood.\n\nConsider: Offering 10 Sheep (170) + 5 Wood (50) for...\nPlayer 0 offered 10 Sheep (170) and 5 Wood (50) for 5 Brick (135) and 3 Wheat (18). This was a bad trade for them.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore.\nI have 6 Wheat, 19 Wood, 16 Sheep, 13 Brick, 10 Ore.\n\nConsider offering some Sheep and Wood for Ore.\nIf I offer 5 Sheep (85) and 5 Wood (50) = 135 total value.\nWhat can I get for 135 value?\n3 Ore = 105. 4 Ore = 140. So 4 Ore is close, good for me.\nThe problem is, Player 0 wants Brick.\n\nWhat if I offer Brick to get Ore, but make sure I profit?\nI have 13 Brick.\nIf I offer 2 Brick (54) + 5 Wheat (30) = 84.\nFor this, I could ask for 3 Ore (105). This is a profit for me. But 3 Ore might be too much for 2 Brick + 5 Wheat.\n\nGiven Player 0's eagerness for Brick, maybe I should offer Brick *and* take something valuable back.\nLet's try an offer that includes Brick, but that is clearly in my favor.\nI have low Wheat. I have high Wood and Sheep.\n\nLet's make an offer where I get Ore.\nOffer: 5 Sheep (85), 5 Wood (50) -> 2 Ore (70), 1 Brick (27). Total value 97.\nMy total: 85 (Sheep) + 50 (Wood) = 135.\nOpponent total: 70 (Ore) + 27 (Brick) = 97.\nStill a 38 value loss for me. Not a good trade.\n\nLet's go back to the idea of trading low value for high value directly.\nI have a lot of Wood and Sheep. Player 0 seems to want Brick.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wood and Sheep for a smaller quantity of Ore and Brick?\n\nLet's try an offer with a clear value gain for me.\nI'll offer some of my high quantities of Wood and Sheep.\nTarget: Ore or Brick or both.\n\nOffer: 8 Sheep (136) + 7 Wood (70) = 206 total value.\nWhat can I get for 206 value?\n5 Ore (175) + 1 Brick (27) = 202. This is close, good for me. Slightly less value but converts cheaper goods to expensive.\nIf I can get 5 Ore (175) + 2 Wheat (12) = 187. Not enough value for me.\n\nMy goal is an increase in total value.\nLet's aim for 5 Ore (175).\nTo get 5 Ore, I want to offer less than 175 in current value.\nE.g., 5 Wheat (30) + 10 Wood (100) + 2 Sheep (34) = 164.\nSo: 5 Wheat, 10 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 5 Ore.\nThis is a gain of 11 value. Is this attractive enough for Player 0?\nThis doesn't include Brick, which Player 0 wants.\n\nLet's try to offer something with Brick.\nIf I offer 2 Brick (54) + 5 Wood (50) = 104.\nI want to get more than 104 back.\n3 Ore (105). This is nearly even.\n\nLet's try to anticipate Player 0's value calculus based on their previous offers.\nPlayer 0 offered:\n- 10 Sheep (170), 5 Wood (50) -> 5 Brick (135), 3 Wheat (18). Player 0's side: 220, My side: 153. Bad for Player 0.\n- 8 Ore (280), 4 Wheat (24) -> 6 Brick (162), 2 Wood (20). Player 0's side: 304, My side: 182. Bad for Player 0.\n\nIt seems Player 0 is consistently valuing Brick much higher than its actual value, and they are willing to take a loss in terms of raw value to get Brick. I should exploit this.\n\nOkay, let's offer some Brick, but get a significant amount of high-value resources back.\nI have 13 Brick.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (81). What do I want?\nI want Ore.\nIf I want 3 Ore (105). I offer 3 Brick (81) for 3 Ore (105). This is 24 value gain for me.\nIs this appealing for Player 0? They get Brick which they value. They give Ore, which they have a lot of (maybe they have a lot).\n\nLet's try this:\nOffer: 3 Brick (81) -> 3 Ore (105).\nValue gain for me: 24.\nPlayer 0 gets Brick. I get high-value Ore. This seems solid.\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 3 Ore]",
