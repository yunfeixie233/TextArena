Player 0 has a lot of Ore (25). Perhaps they don't value it as high as I do, or they want a lot more for it.\n\nLooking at Player 0's offer history (from the game state outside this message), they've not made any offers yet.\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I want to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or trade resources I have in abundance for resources I need.\n\nLet's try to offer something more appealing for Ore, as it's a high-value resource. Player 0 has a lot of it, so they might be willing to part with some.\n\nI have a lot of Wood and Sheep. Wood has a value of 12, Sheep 12. Brick has a value of 24, Wheat 5. Ore has a value of 32.\n\nPerhaps they didn't value Wood and Sheep enough. Let's try to offer some Brick, which is also valuable, but I have 10 of it.\nLet's try to get 1 Ore for some combination of my resources.\n1 Ore = 32 value.\n\nOption 1: Trade some Brick directly for Ore.\nOffer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore\nMy value: 24. Their value: 32. This is a good deal for me. They may not accept.\n\nOption 2: Try to get something that's more balanced from their perspective looking at their presumed needs.\nMaybe 2 Brick for 2 Ore?\nMy value: 2 * 24 = 48. Their value: 2 * 32 = 64. Still good for me.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood and Sheep again, but in different quantities or target.\nI have a lot of Ore myself (25), so maybe I don't need *more* Ore right now. My highest value resource is Ore currently.\n\nWhat about trading for Brick? I have 10 Brick. If I can get more, it's good as well.\nWhat if I try to get some Wheat from them? Wheat has a low value (5), but if I can get a lot for very little, it could be good.\n\nLet's reconsider the previous offer: 5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore\nValue: 96 -> 64. This was a good offer for me. It was rejected.\nMaybe Player 0 doesn't need Wood or Sheep.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer with something different.\nI want resources with high values. Ore (32), Brick (24).\nI have a lot of Wood (18) and Sheep (10).\n\nLet's try to offer a higher quantity of low-value items for a smaller quantity of high-value items that aren't Ore (since they rejected the Ore trade). Let's target Brick.\nValue of 1 Brick: 24\n\nOffer: 8 Wood -> 2 Brick\nMy value: 8 * 12 = 96\nTheir value: 2 * 24 = 48\nThis is not a good deal for them.\n\nLet's try to give them something valuable for something less valuable.\nMaybe they need Sheep or Wheat?\nI have 10 Sheep.\n\nI need to make a trade that benefits me in value.\n\nLet's try to offer a mix:\nOffer: 3 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick\nMy offer value: (3 * 12) + (3 * 12) = 36 + 36 = 72\nRequested value: 1 * 24 = 24\nThis is a bad trade for me. I am giving up too much.\n\nLet's stick to getting Ore, as it is highest value.\nPlayer 0 has 25 Ore. They definitely have enough to trade.\nMaybe the previous offer was too much for **them** to give. Their value was 64 (2 Ore). My offer was 96. They would lose 32 value.\n\nWhat if I offer something more balanced from *their* perspective to get some Ore?\nLet's try to get 1 Ore (Value 32).\nIf I give 1 Brick (Value 24) and something else.\nOffer: 1 Brick, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore\nMy value: 24 + 12 = 36. Their value: 32. This is barely in my favor. They might accept.\nI have 10 Brick, so giving one up might be okay if I get Ore back.\n\nLet's try this:\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
