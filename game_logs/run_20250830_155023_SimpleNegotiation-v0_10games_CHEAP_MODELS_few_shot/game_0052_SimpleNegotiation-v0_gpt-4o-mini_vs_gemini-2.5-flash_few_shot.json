      "response": "Based on the details of the current resources and the trade interactions that have taken place, I will analyze the situation and make strategic decisions for the next offers.\n\n**Current Resources after the trade with Player 1:**\n- **Wheat**: 18 - 2 = 16 (initially 18, traded 2 Wheat)\n- **Wood**: 22\n- **Sheep**: 22 - 4 = 18 (initially 22, traded 4 Sheep)\n- **Brick**: 21 + 5 = 26 (initially 21, received 5 Brick)\n- **Ore**: 6\n\n**Analyzing Player 1's Reactions:**\n- Player 1 accepted the first trade but rejected subsequent offers. This suggests that Player 1 may not be interested in Wheat and Sheep and potentially values Ore and Brick more.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\nGiven that Player 1 has rejected multiple offers containing Wheat and Sheep, I'll try to offer resources that align with what they might find more valuable. Since I just gained Brick but have not gained any Ore yet, I could attempt a new combination of resources to maximize my returns.\n\n**New Trade Offer:**\nI will propose the following offer, hoping it appeals because it includes Brick, which Player 1 may find valuable and I have a surplus of:\n\n**Proposed Offer:**\n[Offer: 5 Brick, 2 Wheat -> 3 Ore, 5 Wood]\n\nThis offer includes resources that I have in surplus (Brick, Wheat) in exchange for resources I lack (Ore, Wood) but will be beneficial in the long run.\n\nLet\u2019s make the offer. \n\n**Final Action:**\n[Offer: 5 Brick, 2 Wheat -> 3 Ore, 5 Wood]",
