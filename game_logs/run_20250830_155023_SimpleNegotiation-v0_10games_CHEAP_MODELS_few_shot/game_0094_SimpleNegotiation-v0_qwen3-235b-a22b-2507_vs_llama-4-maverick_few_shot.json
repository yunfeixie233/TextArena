Since Brick is valuable and we don't have a lot, getting more Brick could be good if the trade isn't too costly.\n\nLet's analyze the possibility of trading something less valuable for something more valuable or of similar value but in a different category.\n\nGiven our resources and the history, a potential trade could involve:\n- Offering some Wheat (least valuable per unit) or Sheep for Brick or more Wood.\n\nLet's make a new offer: \n- Offering 4 Sheep for 2 Brick:\n  - Giving up: 4 * 15 = 60\n  - Receiving: 2 * 29 = 58\n  This isn't a good trade as it's almost equal or slightly negative.\n\nLet's directly propose a trade that seems reasonable based on our current situation and the fact that we want to increase our total value.\n\nConsidering our analysis and the goal to increase the total value, let's make an offer.
