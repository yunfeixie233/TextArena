Given that Ore is the most valuable, I'll try to get some Ore.\n\nLet's make an offer: `[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]`\n\nThis is my action for Turn 1. \n\n### Action:\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]`",

I rejected it. The value of this offer is (3*12 + 1*33) = 69 for 5*29 = 145. This is a good deal, but I rejected it.\n\nMy last offer was: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore. Player 1 rejected it. The value of this offer is 6*5 = 30 for 1*33 = 33. This is a relatively good deal, but Player 1 rejected it.\n\nConsidering the values and the previous trades, my next step will be to make a new offer.\n\nI will make an offer to Player 1: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe action is: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
