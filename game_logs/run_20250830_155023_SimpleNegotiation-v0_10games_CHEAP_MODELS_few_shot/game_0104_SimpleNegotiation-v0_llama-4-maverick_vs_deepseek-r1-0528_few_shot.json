Given the values, Ore is the most valuable per unit, and Wheat is the least.\n\n#### Trade Offer for Turn 1:\nConsidering the values, I think it's beneficial to offer Wheat (the lowest value resource) in exchange for something more valuable if possible. However, I need to be cautious about what I request in return to ensure the trade is beneficial.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n- Offering Wheat for other resources could be a good start since it's the least valuable resource.\n\nHere's a potential trade:\n- I have 13 Wheat, and offering some of it could be reasonable. Let's offer 5 Wheat.\n- A reasonable trade could be to offer Wheat for Brick or Ore since they are more valuable.\n\nLet's make an offer:\n'[Offer:5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis offer is made with the intention of exchanging a less valuable resource for a more valuable one. It is a test to see if the opponent is willing to make such a trade.\n\n#### Action:\n'[Offer:5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'",
