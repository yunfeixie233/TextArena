This involves identifying resources that are likely undervalued or overvalued relative to others and making offers accordingly.\n\n1. **Value Analysis**:\n   - The resources I have are valued as follows: Wheat (6), Wood (9), Sheep (13), Brick (27), Ore (40).\n   - Ore has the highest value, followed by Brick, then Sheep, Wood, and Wheat.\n\n2. **Trade Strategy**:\n   - Given the values, I should aim to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values if possible.\n   - Offering resources like Wheat or Wood for higher-value resources like Brick or Ore could be beneficial.\n\n3. **First Turn Action**:\n   - Since I don't have an incoming offer at the start, I will make an offer.\n   - I will offer resources that are less valuable for more valuable ones. For example, offering Wheat or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\n### Offer for Turn 1\n\nLet's make an offer that trades less valuable resources for more valuable ones. I will offer 5 Wheat and 2 Wood (total value = 5*6 + 2*9 = 30 + 18 = 48) for 2 Brick (value = 2*27 = 54), as this increases my total value.\n\n- **[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick]**\n\n`[Offer: 5 [Wheat], 2 [Wood] -> 2 [Brick]]`",

So, there's no change due to this offer.\n- Then, you offered 3 Ore and 1 Brick for 2 Wheat and 1 Wood, and it was accepted.\n\nLet's calculate the new quantities and values:\n\n1. Initially:\n   - Wheat: Qty = 5, Value = 6\n   - Wood: Qty = 10, Value = 9\n   - Sheep: Qty = 17, Value = 13\n   - Brick: Qty = 19, Value = 27\n   - Ore: Qty = 20, Value = 40\n\n2. After the accepted trade:\n   - You gave away: 3 Ore, 1 Brick\n   - You received: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood\n\n3. New Quantities:\n   - Wheat: 5 + 2 = 7\n   - Wood: 10 + 1 = 11\n   - Sheep: 17 (no change)\n   - Brick: 19 - 1 = 18\n   - Ore: 20 - 3 = 17\n\n4. New Total Value:\n   - Wheat: 7 * 6 = 42\n   - Wood: 11 * 9 = 99\n   - Sheep: 17 * 13 = 221\n   - Brick: 18 * 27 = 486\n   - Ore: 17 * 40 = 680\n   - Total Value = 42 + 99 + 221 + 486 + 680 = 1528\n\n### Planning the Next Move\n\nInitially, your total value was calculated as follows:\n- Wheat: 5 * 6 = 30\n- Wood: 10 * 9 = 90\n- Sheep: 17 * 13 = 221\n- Brick: 19 * 27 = 513\n- Ore: 20 * 40 = 800\n- Initial Total Value = 30 + 90 + 221 + 513 + 800 = 1654\n\nAfter the last transaction, your total value decreased to 1528. You need to make a trade that will increase your total value.\n\n### Making a New Offer\n\nLet's analyze the change:\n- You lost 3 Ore (3*40 = 120) and 1 Brick (1*27 = 27), totaling 147.\n- You gained 2 Wheat (2*6 = 12) and 1 Wood (1*9 = 9), totaling 21.\n\nThe net loss is 147 - 21 = 126.\n\nTo compensate for this loss and potentially gain more, you should look to offer resources that are less valuable to you relative to what you might gain.\n\n### New Offer\n\nConsidering the values, let's make a new offer that could potentially increase your total value.\n\nYou have a lot of Sheep, so offering some Sheep could be a good start if you can get a resource of higher total value in return.\n\nLet's offer 4 Sheep for 3 Ore (since Ore is very valuable).\n\nThe offer: `[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 3 Ore]`\n\nCalculating the value of this offer:\n- You give away: 4 Sheep = 4 * 13 = 52\n- You receive: 3 Ore = 3 * 40 = 120\n\nThis seems like a good trade since you're gaining 120 - 52 = 68 in value.\n\n### Output\n\n`[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 3 Ore]`",

Player 0 offered 5 Wheat, 2 Wood for 2 Brick, but it was rejected.\n2. Player 0 offered 3 Ore, 1 Brick for 2 Wheat, 1 Wood, and it was accepted.\n- Player 0 gave: 3 Ore, 1 Brick\n- Player 0 received: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood\n\n## Step 3: Update resources after the first accepted trade\nAfter the first accepted trade (3 Ore, 1 Brick for 2 Wheat, 1 Wood):\n- [Wheat] Qty: 5 + 2 = 7\n- [Wood] Qty: 10 + 1 = 11\n- [Sheep] Qty: 17 (no change)\n- [Brick] Qty: 19 - 1 = 18\n- [Ore] Qty: 20 - 3 = 17\n\n## Step 4: Update resources after the second trade\n3. Player 0 offered 4 Sheep for 3 Ore, but it was rejected.\n4. Player 1 offered 4 Sheep for 3 Ore, and Player 0 accepted.\n- Player 0 gave: 3 Ore\n- Player 0 received: 4 Sheep\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the new quantities after the second accepted trade\nAfter the second accepted trade (3 Ore for 4 Sheep):\n- [Wheat] Qty: 7 (no change)\n- [Wood] Qty: 11 (no change)\n- [Sheep] Qty: 17 + 4 = 21\n- [Brick] Qty: 18 (no change)\n- [Ore] Qty: 17 - 3 = 14\n\n## Step 6: Assess the current offer from Player 1\nPlayer 1 made an offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood for 3 Sheep.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the offer\nLet's calculate the value of the resources involved in the offer:\n- Player 0 gives: 3 Sheep (Value: 3 * 13 = 39)\n- Player 0 receives: 2 Wheat (Value: 2 * 6 = 12), 1 Wood (Value: 1 * 9 = 9)\nTotal received value = 12 + 9 = 21\nTotal given value = 39\nSince 39 > 21, this trade is not favorable for Player 0.\n\n## Step 8: Decide on the offer\nGiven that the offer is not favorable, Player 0 should deny the offer.\n\n## Step 9: Formulate a response\nThe response to the current offer from Player 1 should be '[Deny]' since the trade is not beneficial.\n\n## Step 10: Consider making a new offer\nLet's think about a potential new offer. Player 0 has:\n- [Wheat] Qty: 7\n- [Wood] Qty: 11\n- [Sheep] Qty: 21\n- [Brick] Qty: 18\n- [Ore] Qty: 14\n\nA potential strategy is to trade resources of lower value or surplus for those of higher value or scarcity.\n\n## Step 11: Propose a new trade offer\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of the abundant resources for something more valuable. For example, offering some Sheep (Value: 13) for Ore (Value: 40) could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 12: Formulate a new offer\nLet's offer 5 Sheep for 2 Ore.\n- Offered: 5 Sheep\n- Requested: 2 Ore\nThe value given = 5 * 13 = 65\nThe value received = 2 * 40 = 80\nThis trade seems beneficial.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Deny]}$ \n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

We might not want to give up too much of either.\n- Sheep is relatively less valuable compared to Ore and Brick but is still a resource.\n\nA potential trade could involve giving up some Sheep or Wood (since they are less valuable per unit) for something more valuable or at least equal in value.\n\n## Step 6: Check the last trade and counterparty's action.\nThe last trade involved giving 5 Sheep for 2 Ore. This increased our Ore, which is very valuable.\n\n## Step 7: Decide on a trade.\nLet's consider offering something for Wheat or Wood since they are relatively less abundant or could be more valuable in certain combinations.\n\n## Step 8: Propose a trade.\nOffering 2 Brick for 3 Wood could be a good trade since Brick is valuable but we have a lot of it, and getting more Wood could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 9: Format the trade according to the game's requirements.\nThe trade offer would be: [Offer: 2 Brick -> 3 Wood]\n\n## Step 10: Write the action in the required format.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 3 Wood]\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer: 2 Brick -> 3 Wood]",
