      "response": "Given the trading history, I've successfully exchanged Sheep for Ore at a beneficial rate multiple times. Each trade of 2 Sheep (value 24) for 1 Ore (value 33) nets a gain of 9 in total value. My current resources still allow for more such trades without depletion. Since this offer has been consistently accepted by Player 1, I propose it again to maximize value. Player 1 has not made counteroffers or indicated resistance to this pattern. With the game nearing its end, I leverage this established trade to further increase my resource value efficiently.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
