The current total value is calculated as:\n   - Wheat: 13 * 5 = 65\n   - Wood: 12 * 9 = 108\n   - Sheep: 8 * 12 = 96\n   - Brick: 5 * 27 = 135\n   - Ore: 21 * 34 = 714\n   - **Total**: 65 + 108 + 96 + 135 + 714 = 1,118\n\n2. **Opponent's Offer Analysis**: The opponent previously offered 5 Wheat (5 * 5 = 25) and 5 Wood (5 * 9 = 45) for 5 Brick (5 * 27 = 135) and 3 Sheep (3 * 12 = 36). The net value change for me if I accepted would be:\n   - Gained: 25 (Wheat) + 45 (Wood) = 70\n   - Lost: 135 (Brick) + 36 (Sheep) = 171\n   - Net: 70 - 171 = -101 (a loss of 101). This is why I rejected it.\n\n3. **Current Situation**: The opponent has been rejecting offers and not making new ones. I need to make an offer that benefits me. Looking at my resources:\n   - I have excess Ore (21) and Wood (12), but low Brick (5) and Sheep (8). Brick has the highest value (27), so acquiring more could be beneficial.\n\n4. **Constructing an Offer**: I should offer resources I have in excess (Ore, Wood) for high-value resources (Brick, Sheep). A possible trade:\n   - Offer 3 Ore (3 * 34 = 102) and 2 Wood (2 * 9 = 18) for 2 Brick (2 * 27 = 54) and 3 Sheep (3 * 12 = 36).\n   - Net value change for me: (54 + 36) - (102 + 18) = 90 - 120 = -30. This is not good.\n\n   Adjusting the offer to be more favorable:\n   - Offer 2 Ore (2 * 34 = 68) and 1 Wood (1 * 9 = 9) for 3 Brick (3 * 27 = 81) and 1 Sheep (1 * 12 = 12).\n   - Net value change: (81 + 12) - (68 + 9) = 93 - 77 = +16.
