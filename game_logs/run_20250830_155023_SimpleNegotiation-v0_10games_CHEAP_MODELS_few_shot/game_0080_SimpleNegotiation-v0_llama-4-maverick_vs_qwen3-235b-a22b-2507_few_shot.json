      "response": "### Negotiation Game Analysis\n\n#### Current Resources and Values\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Quantity = 19, Value = 6\n- **[Wood]**: Quantity = 21, Value = 8\n- **[Sheep]**: Quantity = 6, Value = 12\n- **[Brick]**: Quantity = 12, Value = 23\n- **[Ore]**: Quantity = 9, Value = 37\n\n#### Initial Total Value Calculation\n\nTo understand the starting point, let's calculate the total value of the resources:\n\n1. Wheat: 19 * 6 = 114\n2. Wood: 21 * 8 = 168\n3. Sheep: 6 * 12 = 72\n4. Brick: 12 * 23 = 276\n5. Ore: 9 * 37 = 333\n\nTotal Initial Value = 114 + 168 + 72 + 276 + 333 = 963\n\n#### Strategy\n\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources through trades. To achieve this, we should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but potentially more valuable in future trades.\n\n1. **Identify Low-Value Resources**: Wheat (Value = 6) and Wood (Value = 8) are the lowest value resources. Trading these for higher value resources could be beneficial.\n\n2. **Identify High-Value Resources**: Ore (Value = 37) is the highest value resource. We should be cautious in trading this away. Brick (Value = 23) is also of high value.\n\n#### First Turn Strategy\n\nFor the first turn, let's aim to initiate a trade that could potentially increase our total value. We can offer some of our lower-value resources in exchange for higher-value ones or maintain a balance if the opponent is willing to trade something valuable.\n\nLet's observe the opponent's initial offer or make a cautious offer. Since we don't have information about the opponent's resources, we'll start by making an offer that slightly reduces our lower-value resources in exchange for something potentially more valuable.\n\n#### Trade Offer for Turn 1\n\nWe can offer 2 Wheat and 2 Wood (both relatively low-value resources) in exchange for 1 Sheep (a moderate-value resource). \n\n- **[Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep]**\n\nLet's see the opponent's response.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep]",

      "response": "## Step 1: Review the current state of resources after the last trade.\nAfter accepting the trade offer from Player 1, I, Player 0, gave 4 Wood and 3 Wheat and received 2 Ore. Initially, I had 19 Wheat, 21 Wood, 6 Sheep, 12 Brick, and 9 Ore. So, after the trade, I have: 19 - 3 = 16 Wheat, 21 - 4 = 17 Wood, 6 Sheep (unchanged), 12 Brick (unchanged), and 9 + 2 = 11 Ore.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the current total value of resources.\nTo understand the current state, let's calculate the total value:\n- Wheat: 16 * 6 = 96\n- Wood: 17 * 8 = 136\n- Sheep: 6 * 12 = 72\n- Brick: 12 * 23 = 276\n- Ore: 11 * 37 = 407\nTotal value = 96 + 136 + 72 + 276 + 407 = 987\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the last trade offers made and their outcomes.\nThe last offer made by me was 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, which was rejected by Player 1 twice. It seems that Player 1 is not willing to give 1 Ore for 5 Wheat.\n\n## Step 4: Consider alternative trade offers.\nLet's think about making a different offer. I have 16 Wheat, 17 Wood, 6 Sheep, 12 Brick, and 11 Ore. I need to think about what I can offer that Player 1 might accept, considering the values and quantities.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the value of the last rejected offer.\nThe offer was 5 Wheat (5*6 = 30) for 1 Ore (1*37 = 37). The gain is 37 - 30 = 7. This is a positive gain, but Player 1 didn't accept it. I should consider if there's a better or alternative offer.\n\n## Step 6: Explore other possible trades.\nLet's consider offering something else for Ore since it's highly valued. Another option could be to offer Sheep or Brick for Ore. For example, offering Sheep for Ore: 1 Sheep (1*12 = 12) for 1 Ore (1*37 = 37) is a potential trade, as it gives a gain of 25.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a new trade offer based on the analysis.\nI have 6 Sheep, so I could offer 1 Sheep for 1 Ore. This seems like a potentially acceptable trade since it increases my Ore, which is very valuable.\n\n## Step 8: Decide on the action for this turn.\nI'll make an offer: 1 Sheep for 1 Ore. The offer in the required format is: [Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore].\n\n## Step 9: Write down the action.\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
