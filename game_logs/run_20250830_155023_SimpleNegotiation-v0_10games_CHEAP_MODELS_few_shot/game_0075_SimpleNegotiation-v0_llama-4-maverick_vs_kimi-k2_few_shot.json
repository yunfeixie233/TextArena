Consider offering some of these for more valuable resources.\n\n### Initial Trade Offer\n\nLet's make an initial offer that tries to exchange lower-value resources for higher-value ones. \n\n- Offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore, 2 Brick]`\n  - We're offering (5 * 5) + (3 * 12) = 25 + 36 = 61 value units.\n  - We're requesting (1 * 40) + (2 * 25) = 40 + 50 = 90 value units.\n  \nThis is a reasonable starting point as we're trying to gain more valuable resources.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore, 2 Brick]`\n\nLet's see the response from the opponent.",

Offered: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> Requested: 1 Ore (Accepted)\n   - Lost: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat\n   - Gained: 1 Ore\n\n   New quantities:\n   - Wheat: 23 - 2 = 21\n   - Wood: 18 - 4 = 14\n   - Ore: 13 + 1 = 14\n\n2.

Currently, you have:\n- Wheat: 18\n- Wood: 12\n- Sheep: 7\n- Brick: 23\n- Ore: 14\n\nYou could think about trading resources that are less valuable to you for those that are more valuable. One potential trade could involve offering some Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 12) for Ore (Value: 40), as Ore is quite valuable.\n\nBefore making a new offer, let's analyze your current resources and the last trade you made. You have gained 1 Ore and 1 Brick from your last two trades, which is positive. You should continue to look for opportunities to gain more valuable resources.\n\nResponse:\nSince the offer from Player 1 is beneficial, let's accept it first.\n\n`[Accept]`\n\nAfter accepting, let's think about making a new offer to gain more valuable resources. A potential offer could be:\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's send it:\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`",
