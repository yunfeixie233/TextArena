[Trade #5] 5 Wood, 1 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick  \n   I lose 5\u00d79 + 1\u00d717 = 62, gain 3\u00d729 = 87.  \n   Net change: +87 \u2013 62 = +25  \n\nSumming up:  \n\u201332 \u2013 32 + 25 = \u201339 value points\n\nEven when the last trade looks almost fair (25 value for me), the first two were clearly disadvantageous. I have unintentionally allowed my opponent to extract value from me. Therefore I must stop the trend and look for fairer or favorably skewed trades going forward.\n\n## Current holdings after Turn 5  \nWheat 16 (unchanged)  \nWood 21\u201310\u20132\u20135 = 4  \nSheep 6\u20131 = 5  \nBrick 5+2+2+3 = 12  \nOre 13\u20132 = 11  \nNew TOTAL = 16\u00d75 + 4\u00d79 + 5\u00d717 + 12\u00d729 + 11\u00d736 = 945\n\nRemaining resources are scarce:\n- I have only 4 Wood left, so giving away Wood in bulk is no longer wise.  \n- Brick is up to 12, still moderately scarce.  \n- I have plenty of Ore and Wheat; I\u2019d like to convert them into higher-scarce Brick or Sheep, or hoard even scarcer resources (none appear in play).\n\nTherefore my next action should be a *reverse* trade: try to turn low-value Wheat or Brick into more valuable Sheep/Ore, or into nothing if necessary (declining offers) until the opponent offers something genuinely favorable.\n\nBecause I am allowed one new offer on Turn 6, I will force the opponent to put something attractive on the table by offering a high Wheat-to-Sheep swap. It still uses *low-valued Wheat* heavily, but demands the highly-valued Sheep back, giving me a hefty gain at appraiser\u2019s table.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Brick -> 4 Sheep]",
