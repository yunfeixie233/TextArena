Let's try to fix that.\nThe value of 8 Wheat (8 * 6 = 48) + 2 Sheep (2 * 15 = 30) = 78.\nThe value of 2 Brick (2 * 23 = 46).\nYou lost value in that trade. You need to be more careful.\nIdeally, the value of requested resources should be significantly higher than the value of offered resources.\n\nConsider offering more lower-value items for higher-value items.\nYou have plenty of Wood, Sheep, and Wheat. Brick and Ore are high value.\nLet's try to get more Ore.\n\nFor example, offering 10 Wheat (60) + 5 Wood (60) = 120 value for 2 Ore (70) or 3 Ore (105).\nEven still, 10 Wood (120) and 5 Sheep (75) = 195 value for 3 Ore (105) and 1 Brick (23) = 128. That's still a loss.\nThe value of 1 Ore is 35. You want to give items worth less than 35 for 1 Ore.\n\nLet's try trading Wheat for Brick.\nValue of 1 Brick = 23.\nValue of 1 Wheat = 6.\nSo, you could offer 4 Wheat (24) for 1 Brick (23). That's a fair trade if accepted.\nHowever, you want to *increase* your value. So you want to get more value than you give.\nOffer 3 Wheat (18) for 1 Brick (23). This would increase your value by 5.\n\nAlternatively, consider trading a combination of resources.\nWood (12), Sheep (15), Wheat (6).\n\nLet's offer a combination of lower-value items for a higher-value item.\nTry to get an Ore.\n1 Ore = 35.\nLet's offer 2 Wood (24) and 2 Wheat (12) = 36 value for 1 Ore (35). This is almost perfectly balanced.\n\nConsider this: trade 2 sheep (30 value) for 1 Brick (23 value). This would be a loss of 7 value. We need to avoid losses.\nTrade 1 Brick (23 value) for 2 Sheep (30 value) - Player 1 would be interested in this as it's a gain for them.\n\nLet's offer a good deal for us, and somewhat for Player 1 so they will accept this time.\nPlayer 1 has denied many reasonable offers so far.\n\nOffer: 6 Wheat (36) + 2 Wood (24) = 60 value.\nRequest: 2 Brick (46) + 1 Wood (12) = 58 value. This is almost balanced, a slight gain for us if accepted.\n\nLet's rethink a good strategy. Player 1 seems to want Brick.\nWe want Ore.\n\nTry to trade cheaper goods for Ore.\nWe have 11 Ore. We want more.\n1 Ore = 35.\nCan we trade for 1 Ore?\n3 Wood (36 value) for 1 Ore (35 value)? That's too close to break even.\n4 Wheat (24) + 1 Wood (12) = 36 value for 1 Ore (35 value).\n\nLet's make a smaller, more tempting offer.\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue of 3 Wood = 3 * 12 = 36.\nValue of 1 Ore = 35.\nThis is almost 1:1, a slight loss for us, but it could lead to getting the Ore we want in future trades.\nIt's a very slight loss, but might be accepted.\n\nLet's try to make a positive value trade.\nOffer 4 Wheat (24 value) for 1 Brick (23 value). Still bad.\nOffer 3 Wheat (18 value) for 1 Brick (23 value). This is a gain of 5. Player 1 denied this type of offer before.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Offer a small amount of a high value resource we have in abundance for a very high value resource.\nWe have 11 Ore (35 Value).\nWe have 8 Brick (23 Value).\nWe have 21 Wood (12 value).\nWe have 21 Sheep (15 value).\nWe have 9 Wheat (6 value).\n\nSuppose we trade 1 Wood (12) for 1 Wheat (6). Loss.\nSuppose we trade 1 Sheep (15) for 1 Wood (12). Loss.\n\nLet's offer something that clearly benefits us.\nValue of 1 Brick = 23. Value of 1 Ore = 35.\nTry to give 1 Brick for 1 Ore and something else. Unlikely.\n\nWhat about trying to get more Brick? We only have 8.\nOffer: 3 Sheep (45) + 3 Wood (36) -> 3 Brick (69).\nValue difference: 69 - (45 + 36) = 69 - 81 = -12. This is a big loss.\n\nLet's stick to the strategy of giving low-value items for high-value items where the requested value is higher.\n\nCurrent resource breakdown by value:\nWheat: 9 * 6 = 54\nWood: 21 * 12 = 252\nSheep: 21 * 15 = 315\nBrick: 8 * 23 = 184\nOre: 11 * 35 = 385\n\nLet's target Ore. It's the highest value.\nValue to obtain: 1 Ore = 35.\nTo make a profit, we need to offer items with a total value less than 35.\nWe have 21 Wood (12 each).\nWe have 21 Sheep (15 each).\nWe have 9 Wheat (6 each).\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep (30) for 1 Ore (35). This gains us 5 value. This is a good offer.\nPlayer 1 may not have Ore to give up. They didn't propose giving Ore before.\nThey seem to have requested Brick in previous turns.\n\nLet's try to trade for Brick again.\nValue of 1 Brick = 23.\nOffer: 1 Wood (12) and 1 Wheat (6) = 18. This brings a gain of 5 value (23-18).\n[Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
