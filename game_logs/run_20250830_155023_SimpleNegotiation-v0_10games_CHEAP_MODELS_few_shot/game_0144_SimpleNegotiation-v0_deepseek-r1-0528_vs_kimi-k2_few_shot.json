I value Wheat at 5 per unit, and I have a surplus. I will attempt to trade Wheat for Bricks, as Bricks have a higher per-unit value (20). Specifically, offering 3 Wheat (worth 15 to me) for 1 Brick (worth 20 to me) would increase my total value by 5 if accepted. While previous offers for Bricks have been rejected, using Wheat as an offer is a new approach that might appeal to Player 1 if they need Wheat for their own goals.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
