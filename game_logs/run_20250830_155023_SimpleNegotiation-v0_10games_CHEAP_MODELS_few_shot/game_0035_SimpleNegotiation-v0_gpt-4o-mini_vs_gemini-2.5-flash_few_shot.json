I could offer a combination of Sheep and Ore to gain more valuable resources like Brick.\n2. Specifically, I notice that trading 3 Sheep and 2 Ore for 5 Brick could be favorable. This would maintain a good exchange rate since:\n   - I provide resources worth \\( (3 \\times 17) + (2 \\times 39) = 51 + 78 = 129 \\).\n   - I receive resources worth \\( 5 \\times 29 = 145 \\).\n\nWith that in mind, my first action will be:\n\n**Turn 1:**\n- [Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep] \n\nNow, I will wait for the opponent's response to my offer.",

      "response": "Player 1, it is your turn. You can make an offer or accept/deny the offer from Player 0.\nYour resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 6    Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 16   Value: 11\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 23   Value: 16\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 11   Value: 26\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 14   Value: 34\nPlayer 0 offered: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Ore\n\nMy analysis:\n- Player 0's offer:\n    - Offered: 4 Wheat (Value: 4 * 6 = 24), 2 Wood (Value: 2 * 11 = 22) => Total offered value = 46\n    - Requested: 3 Ore (Value: 3 * 34 = 102)\n- This offer is heavily in Player 0's favor (requests items worth 102 for items worth 46). I should deny this.\n\nMy strategy:\nMy priority is to increase my total value. I have a good amount of Sheep and Wood, which are relatively low in value per unit. Ore and Brick are high value. I want to acquire more Ore and Brick.\n\nI will try to make an offer that is slightly in my favor, or balanced, but leverages resources I have in abundance for resources I need.\n\nLet's propose trading some Sheep for Ore. I have 23 Sheep, a lot. I also have 16 Wood.\n\nConsiderations for a new offer:\n- I want Ore (34 value) and Brick (26 value).\n- I have a lot of Sheep (16 value) and Wood (11 value). Wheat (6 value) is also good for trading, but I only have 6.\n\nLet's try to trade Sheep and Wood for Ore.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (3 * 16 = 48) and 1 Wood (1 * 11 = 11) = 59 value\nI could request 1 Ore (34) and 1 Brick (26) = 60 value. This is a very fair offer from my side, slightly in my favor if they accept the value difference.\n\nAlternatively, I know Player 0 wants Ore. They have frequently tried to get Ore from me. I should be careful not to give too much Ore if it's highly valued by Player 0.\n\nLet's try to get more high-value items for my lower-value items.\nI have a significant amount of Sheep and Wood.\n\nOffer: 5 Sheep (5 * 16 = 80) -> 2 Ore (2 * 34 = 68) and 1 Brick (1 * 26 = 26) Oh this is too much for me to give.\n5 Sheep = 80.  2 Ore = 68. 1 Brick = 26. This would be 5 Sheep for 2 Ore and 1 Brick (total requested value 94). My offer value (80) is less than requested (94). This is a bad offer from my side. I need to get more value than I give.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. I want to gain value.\nOffered items value should be less than requested items value, from my perspective.\n\nExample: My offer: 3 Sheep (48) + 2 Wood (22) = 70. Request: 2 Ore (68) + 1 Wheat (6) = 74. This is a good trade for me, because I give away cheaper items that I have in abundance for valuable items I want, even though the numerical value gain is small.\n\nLet's try to target Brick, as Player 0 has offered Brick previously.\nPlayer 0 has often requested Ore. This indicates they value Ore highly. I should use that to my advantage.\n\nLet's make an offer where I get Ore.\nMy current Ore quantity is 14. Brick is 11. These are my highest value/unit items.\n\nIf I offer, say, 7 Sheep (7 * 16 = 112) for 3 Ore (3 * 34 = 102). This is a bad trade for me.\n\nLet's try to leverage \u0639\u0646\u062f\u064a Sheep and Wood.\nMy offer: Resources I give -> Resources I want\n\nConsider offering a good quantity of Sheep and Wood for Ore or Brick.\n\nOffer: 8 Sheep (8 * 16 = 128) -> 4 Brick (4 * 26 = 104) and 1 Wheat (1 * 6 = 6). Total wanted 110. Still a bad trade for me.\n\nI need to make an offer where my resources given are less in value than the resources I wish to receive.\n\nLet's assume Player 0 is looking for Ore. I can use that and ask for more value for it. But I don't want to give it easily.\n\nHow about I offer to take some of their less valuable resources in exchange for some of my more abundant resources, and try to get a high-value resource back.\n\nLet's target getting 1 Ore.\nTo get 1 Ore (34 value):\nI can offer 2 Wood (22) and 1 Wheat (6) = 28. Then I would need to add something to reach 34, or make it slightly enticing for P0.\nThis might be too small of an offer.\n\nLet's make an offer that feels substantial.\nWhat if I offer a large amount of Sheep and Wood for some Ore and Brick?\n\nOffer 5 Sheep (5 * 16 = 80) + 3 Wood (3 * 11 = 33) = 113 value.\nRequest 3 Ore (3 * 34 = 102) + 1 Brick (1 * 26 = 26) = 128 value.\nThis seems like a good offer for me. I give away 113 value in low-value resources for 128 value in high-value resources. I have plenty of Sheep and Wood.\n\nI will make this offer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"Offer\",\n  \"offer\": {\n    \"Sheep\": 5,\n    \"Wood\": 3\n  },\n  \"request\": {\n    \"Ore\": 3,\n    \"Brick\": 1\n  }\n}\n```",
