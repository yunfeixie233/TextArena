      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to carefully analyze the current situation and potential trades. Let's first assess the total value of my current resources:\n\n1. Wheat: 12 * 5 = 60\n2. Wood: 19 * 11 = 209\n3. Sheep: 9 * 14 = 126\n4. Brick: 19 * 26 = 494\n5. Ore: 6 * 40 = 240\n\nTotal value = 60 + 209 + 126 + 494 + 240 = 1129\n\nTo increase the total value, I should look for opportunities to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but with a potential for future gain. Since the values of resources are given, I'll prioritize trades that increase the total value.\n\nLet's start by examining potential trades:\n\n1. Offering Wheat (Value: 5) for other resources could be beneficial if I can get resources of higher value.\n2. My resources include a good quantity of Brick (Value: 26) and Wood (Value: 11), which could potentially be used to get higher-value resources like Ore (Value: 40).\n\nFor the first turn, I will make an offer that attempts to increase my total value. Noting that Ore is one of the highest value resources and I have a relatively low quantity of it, I'll consider offering some of my more abundant resources to gain more Ore.\n\nGiven my current resources, a potential trade could be offering some Brick or Wood for Ore. For instance, offering 2 Brick (2 * 26 = 52) for 1 Ore (1 * 40 = 40) might not be favorable due to the loss in total value. However, if I can negotiate a better deal, it could work.\n\nLet's make an initial offer: \n\n'[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Brick -> 2 Ore]'\n\nThis offer gives away: 3 Wood (3 * 11 = 33) + 1 Brick (1 * 26 = 26) = 59 in total value.\nAnd requests: 2 Ore (2 * 40 = 80) in total value.\n\nThe net gain would be 80 - 59 = 21, which is a positive gain.\n\nSo, my action for Turn 1 is:\n'[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Brick -> 2 Ore]'",

      "response": "To make a decision, let's first summarize the current state and the history of the game.\n\n### Current Resources:\n- Wheat: 12\n- Wood: 19 - 3 (previous offer) - 4 (previous offer) - 5 (previous offer) = 7\n- Sheep: 9 - 2 (accepted trade) - 1 (previous offer) = 6\n- Brick: 19 - 1 (previous offer) + 5 (accepted trade) - 3 (previous offer) = 20\n- Ore: 6 + 3 (accepted trade) - 2 (previous offer) - 2 (previous offer) = 5\n\nCorrected calculation:\n- Wheat: 12 - 2 (previous offer) - 1 (Player 1's offer) = 9\n- Wood: 19 - 3 + 5 (accepted trade) - 4 - 5 = 12\n- Sheep: 9 - 2 + 3 (accepted trade) - 1 = 9\n- Brick: 19 - 1 + 5 - 3 = 20\n- Ore: 6 + 3 - 2 - 2 = 5\n\nLet's correct and simplify the count based on actual transactions:\n\n1. Initial: Wheat=12, Wood=19, Sheep=9, Brick=19, Ore=6\n2. After accepted trade (2 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 3 Ore): Wheat=12, Wood=19, Sheep=7, Brick=21, Ore=9\n3. After the last offers and counter-offers, we need to track changes:\n   - Offered: 3 Wood, 1 Brick -> Requested: 2 Ore (Rejected)\n   - Offered: 4 Wood -> Requested: 1 Ore (Rejected)\n   - Offered: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> Requested: 3 Sheep (Rejected)\n   - Counter-offer from Player 1: Offered: 2 Ore, 1 Sheep -> Requested: 3 Brick, 1 Wheat (Pending)\n\nCorrect count before the last decision:\n- Wheat: 12 - 2 = 10\n- Wood: 19 - 3 - 4 - 5 = 7\n- Sheep: 7 - 1 = 6 (considering the last offer)\n- Brick: 21 - 3 = 18 (considering the last counter-offer)\n- Ore: 9 + 2 = 11 (considering the last counter-offer)\n\nLet's accurately calculate the resources after each step:\n1. You start with: Wheat=12, Wood=19, Sheep=9, Brick=19, Ore=6\n2. You offered: 3 Wood, 1 Brick for 2 Ore. (Not accepted, so no change)\n3. You offered: 2 Sheep, 2 Brick for 3 Ore. (Accepted)\n   - So, you have: Wheat=12, Wood=19-3=16, Sheep=9-2=7, Brick=19+5-2=21 (considering only the accepted trade and the first offer), Ore=6+3=9\n   - After the first offer (not accepted): Wheat=12, Wood=16, Sheep=7, Brick=21, Ore=9\n4. You offered: 4 Wood for 1 Ore. (Not accepted)\n   - So, you have: Wheat=12, Wood=16-4=12, Sheep=7, Brick=21, Ore=9\n5. You offered: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat for 3 Sheep. (Not accepted)\n   - You have: Wheat=12-2=10 (back to original after offer rejected), Wood=12-5=7, Sheep=7, Brick=21, Ore=9\n6. You offered: 2 Ore, 1 Sheep for 5 Wood, 2 Wheat. (Not accepted)\n   - So, you have: Wheat=10, Wood=7, Sheep=7+1=8 (back to original), Brick=21, Ore=9+2=11 (back to original after offer rejected)\n7. Player 1 offered: 2 Ore, 1 Sheep for 3 Brick, 1 Wheat. (Pending)\n\nNow, let's evaluate Player 1's last offer: \n- Offered: 2 Ore, 1 Sheep -> Requested: 3 Brick, 1 Wheat\n\nIf accepted, you will give away 3 Brick and 1 Wheat, and receive 2 Ore and 1 Sheep.\n\nCurrent state before considering the last offer:\n- Wheat: 10\n- Wood: 7\n- Sheep: 8\n- Brick: 21\n- Ore: 11\n\nValue calculation:\n- Current total value = (10*5) + (7*11) + (8*14) + (21*26) + (11*40)\n- Current total value = 50 + 77 + 112 + 546 + 440 = 1225\n\nIf you accept Player 1's offer:\n- New quantities: Wheat = 10 - 1 = 9, Wood = 7, Sheep = 8 + 1 = 9, Brick = 21 - 3 = 18, Ore = 11 + 2 = 13\n- New total value = (9*5) + (7*11) + (9*14) + (18*26) + (13*40)\n- New total value = 45 + 77 + 126 + 468 + 520 = 1236\n\nSince 1236 is greater than 1225, accepting the offer is beneficial.\n\nTherefore, my action is: [Accept]",
