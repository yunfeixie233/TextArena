Noting that Sheep has a lower value than Brick but is still a resource, we could try to offer a combination that includes Sheep or other less valued resources to see if Player 1 is interested.\n\n**New Offer:** Considering the rejection of Brick for Ore trades, let's try offering Ore for a resource that could potentially be of interest to us, like Sheep or Wood, which are less valuable than Ore but might be a starting point.\n\nHowever, given that our previous offers were rejected and there's no new offer from Player 1, a straightforward approach is to adjust our offer to be more appealing. Let's directly adjust the offer to be more conservative.\n\n### New Trade Offer\n'[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis reduces the quantity of Brick offered in exchange for Ore, making it potentially more acceptable to Player 1.\n\n### Action\n'[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]'",

The goal is to increase the total value through trades.\n\n5. **Potential Trades**:\n   - Consider trading less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n   - Notice that Wood (Value: 10) is relatively less valuable compared to Ore (Value: 39). Trading some less valuable resources or those in surplus for Ore or other more valuable resources could be beneficial.\n\n6. **Formulate a Trade Offer**:\n   - Given that Ore is highly valued and I have 10 Ore, consider what I can offer for more Ore or other valuable resources.
