I have very few (6) and should avoid trading it away unless the return is exceptional.\n   - **Sheep** has the next highest value (18), but I have a lot (24). These are good trade candidates.\n   - **Brick** has moderate value (21), and I have a lot (25). These are also good trade candidates.\n   - **Wheat** and **Wood** have lower values and higher quantities, making them less urgent to trade.\n\n3. **Trade Strategy**:\n   - Target trades where I give away **Sheep** and/or **Brick** in exchange for **Ore** or **Wood** (since Wood has value 8, lower than others, but I have very little of it).\n   - Avoid trading Ore unless the return is extremely favorable.\n\n4. **Turn 1 Approach**:\n   - A balanced offer to test the opponent's willingness: Offer a small amount of Sheep and Brick for Ore or Wood.\n\n### Turn 1 Action:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 2 Wood]",
