Sheep and Brick are next in value (14 and 21), while Wheat and Wood are the least valuable.\n\n2. **Trade History**: \n   - Earlier, Player 1 accepted a trade of 3 Sheep for 1 Ore (valuable trade since Ore is 1.5x the value of Sheep per unit).\n   - Player 0 keeps offering 2 of something for 1 Ore (always underpaying for Ore). \n   - Player 1's last offer (3 Brick -> 2 Ore) was rejected, likely because Player 0 values Ore highly.\n\n3. **Current Offer Evaluation**: Player 0 offers 2 Brick for 1 Ore.\n   - 2 Brick = 2 * 21 = 42 value given up.\n   - 1 Ore = 32 value received.\n   - This is a net loss of 10 value for Player 1. Reject this.\n\n4. **Next Move**: \n   - Ore is scarce and highly valued. Player 0 seems to want Ore badly, so we should not trade it away unless we get a better deal.\n   - Brick is moderately valued; we have 9 Brick (value 21 each). Trading 3 Brick for 2 Ore was rejected, so we could try offering 4 Brick for 2 Ore (a better ratio to tempt Player 0).\n\n5. **Decision**: Reject the current 2 Brick for 1 Ore offer and instead offer 4 Brick for 2 Ore, giving Player 0 a better deal (2:1 ratio instead of 3:2).\n\nFinal answer: [Deny]",
