      "response": "Reflecting on the previous turns, I see that we've both been hesitant to trade, but I really need to adjust my resources for better overall value. I noticed you once offered me 3 Ore for just 2 Wheat and 4 Wood. That deal made me think you might value Wheat and Wood more than I do, or perhaps you have a surplus of Ore that I could help balance. Though I rejected it earlier for strategic reasons, I've reconsidered\u2014especially with this being the final turn\u2014and propose that same trade now. It\u2019s a clean, straightforward offer that aligns with your previous interest. Let\u2019s see if we can end the game with a successful exchange. \n\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 3 Ore]",
