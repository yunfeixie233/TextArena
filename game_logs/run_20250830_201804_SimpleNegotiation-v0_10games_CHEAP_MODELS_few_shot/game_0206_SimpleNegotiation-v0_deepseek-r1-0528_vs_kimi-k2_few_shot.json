      "response": "After reviewing past trades and current resources, I recognize that Ore is highly valuable (40) while Wood (8) and Sheep (13) hold lower value. I aim to propose a trade that increases my total value while leveraging resources I have in surplus. \n\nBrick (30) is a strong asset, but trading one Brick for one Ore yields a net gain of +10 in value for me. Player 1 previously prioritized Brick in their offer (requesting 3 Brick for 8 Wood and 4 Sheep), indicating potential interest. I\u2019ll test a direct swap while keeping risks low with small quantities.  \n\nI offer:  \n**[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]**",
