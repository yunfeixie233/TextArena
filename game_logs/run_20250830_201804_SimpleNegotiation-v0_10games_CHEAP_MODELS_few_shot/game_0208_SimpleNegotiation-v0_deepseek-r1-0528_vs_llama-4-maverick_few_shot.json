Since Ore is the most valuable resource we have and attempts to trade Wheat for Ore have been rejected, we should look for other opportunities.\n\n### New Offer:\nLet's try to offer Ore for a resource that could potentially increase our total value or is at least comparable in value. \n\nGiven that:\n- Ore (Value: 37) is our most valuable resource.\n- We have been rejecting offers for Brick.\n\nLet's consider offering some Ore for Sheep, as Sheep is relatively valuable compared to Wood and Wheat but less than Ore, Brick, and might be something the opponent is willing to part with.\n\n### Action:\n```[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep]```\n\nLet's make this offer to see if Player 0 is willing to trade. This is Turn 10, so it's our last chance to make a trade.\n\n```[Offer: 1 Ore, 0 Sheep -> 3 Sheep]``` is simplified to \n```[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep]```. \n\nExecuting the action:\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep]",
