Ore has the highest value, so I'd be reluctant to trade it away unless getting very favorable rates.\n\nLet me see what's available. I notice I have more Ore and Brick than other players typically value, so these might be good trading chips. My 24 Wheat seems excessive given its low value.\n\nFor a starting offer, since I have so much Wheat and relatively good amounts of Brick/Ore, I could offer something like:\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 3 Sheep]\n\nThis would give me:\n- Giving up: 5\u00d76 + 2\u00d735 = 30 + 70 = 100 value\n- Receiving: 5\u00d724 + 3\u00d713 = 120 + 39 = 159 value\nNet gain: +59 value\n\nWould you be interested in this trade?",

This is a negative trade for me, so I will deny it.\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I need to make an offer that is beneficial to me. I have plenty of Sheep, and fewer Ore/Brick. Player 0 seems to want Brick and Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get more high-value items like Ore or Brick, and give away some lower-value items or items I have in abundance like Sheep or Wheat.\n\nI have 16 Sheep, which is a lot. I have 9 Wheat, also a fair amount. I have 8 Ore, 10 Brick.\n\nLet's try to trade some Sheep and Wheat for Brick or Ore.\n\nI'll try to offer a slightly more balanced trade than Player 0's offer, still trying to get some Brick or Ore since they are high value.\n\nPerhaps I can offer Sheep and Wheat for Brick.\n\nLet's propose: Give 5 Sheep and 2 Wheat (5*18 + 2*5 = 90 + 10 = 100 value) and ask for 4 Brick (4*20 = 80 value)\nThis is not good for me as I am giving up more value.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nOffer: 5 Sheep (5*18 = 90)\nRequest: 2 Ore (2*36 = 72)\nThis is also me giving up more value.\n\nI need to make a profitable offer.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Player 0 asked for Brick and Sheep. I have Sheep. I'm okay giving some Sheep away if I get something valuable like Ore or Brick in return, at a good ratio for me.\n\nConsider an offer where I give away some Sheep and Wheat, and ask for Brick.\n\nOffer: 6 Sheep, 3 Wheat (6*18 + 3*5 = 108 + 15 = 123)\nRequest: 6 Brick (6*20 = 120)\nThis is close to even value, not really profitable for me.\n\nI need to get *more* value than I give.\n\nLet's try to offer items I have in abundance for items I have less of, or items of higher value.\nI have 16 Sheep. I can part with some.\n\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of Sheep for some high-value Ore or Brick?\n\nOffer: 9 Sheep (9 * 18 = 162)\nRequest: 3 Ore (3 * 36 = 108) OR 8 Brick (8 * 20 = 160)\n\nThe 8 Brick option is better for me in terms of value given vs received, but not by much.\n\nLet's try to construct an offer that gives me a clear profit.\n\nPlayer 0's initial offer for me was a loss of 57 value. I need to flip this.\n\nHow about I offer 5 Wheat and 5 Sheep (5*5 + 5*18 = 25 + 90 = 115) and ask for 3 Brick and 1 Ore (3*20 + 1*36 = 60 + 36 = 96). Still not good for me.\n\nI will make an offer to gain some high-value Ore.\n\nMaybe I can offer Sheep and Wood. I have a lot of Sheep and Wood.\nSheep: 16 (Value: 18)\nWood: 12 (Value: 9)\n\nOffer: 8 Sheep, 5 Wood (8 * 18 + 5 * 9 = 144 + 45 = 189)\nRequest: 5 Ore (5 * 36 = 180)\nIn this case, I'm giving up 189 value for 180 value. Still a loss.\n\nI need to gain value.\n\nLet's try to offer a lower *amount* of value and request a higher *amount* of value.\n\nHow about I offer items of low value? Wheat is lowest at 5. Wood is next at 9.\n\nWhat if I offer a lot of Wheat and some Sheep for a couple of Ore?\nOffer: 9 Wheat, 4 Sheep (9*5 + 4*18 = 45 + 72 = 117)\nRequest: 3 Ore (3*36 = 108) - Still a loss for me.\n\nThis is tricky. I need to make a profit.\n\nI have 16 Sheep. If I trade them at a good rate, that's fine.\nI have 10 Brick. If I can trade for Ore, that's good.\n\nLet's try to gain Brick. I need 1 Brick, its value is 20.\nLet's give 2 Wheat (2*5=10) and 1 Wood (1*9=9). Total: 19. If I get 1 Brick, it's pretty even.\nNot profitable enough.\n\nI need to increase my total value.\n\nI will deny Player 0's offer because it's a significant loss for me.\n\nI will make an offer that is clearly profitable for me, while hopefully being attractive enough for Player 0.\n\nPlayer 0 asked for Brick and Sheep. I'm okay giving Sheep.\nLet me target their stated needs.\n\nWhat if I offer 5 Sheep and ask for 2 Brick?\n5 Sheep (5 * 18 = 90)\n2 Brick (2 * 20 = 40)\nThis is a massive loss for me. Player 0 should accept it, but I shouldn't offer it.\n\nI will make an offer to get more Ore.\nI current have 8 Ore (value 288).\nI will offer some Sheep and Wheat which I have plenty of and are lower value.\n\nOffer: 7 Sheep, 5 Wheat (7*18 + 5*5 = 126+25 = 151 value)\nRequest: 3 Ore, 1 Brick (3*36 + 1*20 = 108 + 20 = 128 value)\nStill a loss for me.\n\nI need to make an offer where the requested items' value is higher than the offered items' value. This is crucial for profit.\n\nLet's try the opposite logic. Offer high value, ask for higher value. No.\nOffer low value, ask for high value.\n\nOffer: 5 Wheat, 3 Sheep (5*5 + 3*18 = 25+54 = 79 value)\nRequest: 2 Brick, 1 Wood (2*20 + 1*9 = 40+9 = 49 value)\nStill a loss.\n\nI need to *receive* more value than I *give*.\n\nLet's try to gain Brick.\nMy Brick value: 20\nMy Sheep value: 18\nMy Wheat value: 5\n\nI have 16 Sheep. I can give a few.\n\nOffer: 3 Sheep (3 * 18 = 54)\nRequest: 3 Brick (3 * 20 = 60)\nThis is a gain of 6 value for me. This is profitable! And I have plenty of Sheep to make this trade.\nPlayer 0 wanted Brick and Sheep, so they might be interested in getting Sheep to give Brick.\n\nLet's propose this.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 3 Brick]",

I should avoid trading it away unless I get high-value resources in return.\n- Wood is the least valuable (11), and Wheat is second least (6). I'm willing to trade these for Brick or Sheep at favorable rates.\n- Brick (24) is more valuable than Sheep (13), so I'm willing to trade Sheep for Brick if the ratio is good.\n\n### Next Offer to Player 1\nI should try to get Brick or Sheep for Wheat/Wood. Since Player 1 rejected my last offer (5 Wheat + 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 3 Sheep), they likely value Ore or Brick highly. I'll try a simpler offer focusing on Wheat for Brick.\n\n- **My Offer**: 6 Wheat \u2192 3 Brick\n  - This gives a 1:2 Wheat:Brick ratio (Value: 6*6 = 36 \u2192 3*24 = 72), which is a profit of 36 for me.\n  - Seems fair for Player 1 since Wheat is less common and useful for settlements/roads.\n  \n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 3 Brick]",

Given the high value of Brick (24) compared to Wheat (6), a 2:1 ratio might be more appealing.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 4 Brick]",
