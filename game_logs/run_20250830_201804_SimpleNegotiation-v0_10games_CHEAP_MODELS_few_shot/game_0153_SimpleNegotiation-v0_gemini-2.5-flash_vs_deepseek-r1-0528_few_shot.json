      "response": "In this game, my goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I need to make trade offers to Player 1 that benefit me.\nI have the following resources:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 21 (Value: 6)\n*   [Wood] Qty: 6 (Value: 11)\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 8 (Value: 18)\n*   [Brick] Qty: 14 (Value: 27)\n*   [Ore] Qty: 21 (Value: 37)\n\nLet's calculate my initial total value:\n(21 * 6) + (6 * 11) + (8 * 18) + (14 * 27) + (21 * 37)\n= 126 + 66 + 144 + 378 + 777 = 1491\n\nI want to make offers that give me higher value resources for lower value resources, or consolidate my resources to fewer types if they are close in value.\n\nConsidering the values: Wheat (6) < Wood (11) < Sheep (18) < Brick (27) < Ore (37).\n\nI have a lot of Wheat and Ore. Brick and Ore are the highest value resources.\nI have 21 Wheat (value 6) and 6 Wood (value 11).\nI have 14 Brick (value 27) and 21 Ore (value 37).\n\nMy strategy will be to try and trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\nFor example, trading Wheat for Wood, Sheep, Brick, or Ore. Or trading Wood for Sheep, Brick, or Ore.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat for Brick or Ore, or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\nOffer 1: I will offer a significant amount of Wheat for some Brick, as Brick has a much higher value.\nI have 21 Wheat (Value 6) which is 126 in total value.\nI have 14 Brick (Value 27) which is 378 in total value.\n\nPerhaps I can offer Wheat and Sheep for Brick and Ore.\nLet's try a simpler offer first.\n\nI will try to trade Wheat for Brick.\nValue of 1 Brick = 27. Value of 1 Wheat = 6.\nSo approximately 4.5 Wheat = 1 Brick.\n\nIf I offer 5 Wheat (value 30) for 1 Brick (value 27), I lose 3 value, which is not good.\nIf I offer 4 Wheat (value 24) for 1 Brick (value 27), I gain 3 value. This is a good trade.\nPlayer 1 might not accept this, as they would lose 3 value.\n\nI want to make an offer that is slightly in my favor, but still appealing to Player 1.\nLet's try to offer a quantity of my lower value resources for a quantity of higher value resources.\n\nI have 21 Wheat. I have 14 Brick and 21 Ore.\nI have a decent amount of Sheep and Wood.\n\nConsider trading Wheat, as I have a lot of it and its value is the lowest.\nLet's try offering a larger quantity of Wheat for a smaller quantity of Brick.\nIf I offer 7 Wheat (value 42) for 2 Brick (value 54), I gain 12 value. This is good for me.\nPlayer 1 would lose 12 value.\n\nWhat about trading Wood for Brick/Ore? Or Sheep for Brick/Ore?\n\nLet's try to offer a mix.\nPerhaps I can trade some Wheat and Wood for some Ore.\nI have 6 Wood (value 11) and 21 Wheat (value 6).\nOre value is 37.\n\n2 Wood (value 22) for 1 Ore (value 37)? I would gain 15 value. Player 1 loses 15. Too steep.\n3 Wheat (value 18) for 1 Sheep (value 18). No gain.\n\nI need to make an offer that looks appealing to them too.\nMaybe they want a specific resource. I don't know what they have.\n\nI will make an offer for something I have plenty of (Wheat) for something I want (Brick/Ore).\n\nOffer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick\nMy value: 5 * 6 = 30\nRequested value: 1 * 27 = 27\nI lose 3 value. This isn't good for me.\n\nOffer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick\nMy value: 4 * 6 = 24\nRequested value: 1 * 27 = 27\nI gain 3 value. This is what I want. Player 1 loses 3.\n\nLet's try to offer something where the total quantity of items exchanged is similar, or my offer is larger than my request quantity.\n\nI have 21 Wheat. I want more high-value resources.\nI will propose trading Wheat for Ore.\nValue of Ore (37) / Value of Wheat (6) = approx 6.16. So about 6-7 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n\nIf I offer 6 Wheat (value 36) for 1 Ore (value 37), I gain 1 value. Small gain, but positive. Player 1 loses 1 value. This is a reasonable first offer.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
