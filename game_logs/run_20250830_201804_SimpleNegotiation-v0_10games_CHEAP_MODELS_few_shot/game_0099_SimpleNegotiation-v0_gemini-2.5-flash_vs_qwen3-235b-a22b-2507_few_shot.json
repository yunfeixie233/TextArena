Sheep (16) is mid-range.\n\nPerhaps trade some of your higher quantity, lower-value items for a high-value item like Ore or Brick.\n\nYou have a good amount of Wood and Sheep. You could consider offering something like 3 Wood for 1 Brick (30 value for 27 value, but you also want to shed lower value items and gain higher value items). Or perhaps 2 Sheep for 1 Brick (32 value for 27 value).\n\nLet's try to trade some Wood and Sheep for something of higher value like Ore or Brick, or even improve the ratio for Wheat.\nMaybe offer some Wood and Sheep for Ore.\n\nOffer: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore (3*10 + 1*16 = 46 value for 40 value) - This might be a bit too much on your side, but it helps get rid of low/mid value for high value.\nIf you offer 2 Wood, 1 Sheep (36 value) for 1 Ore (40 value), that looks pretty good for you.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
