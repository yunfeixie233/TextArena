      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, let's analyze the current state of resources and their values:\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 16, Value: 6\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 9, Value: 11\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 7, Value: 13\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 25, Value: 24\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 12, Value: 38\n\nThe total value of resources = (16*6) + (9*11) + (7*13) + (25*24) + (12*38)  \n= 96 + 99 + 91 + 600 + 456  \n= 1342\n\n### Objective\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources through trades.\n\n### Initial Trade Strategy\nTo maximize the total value, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but more quantity if it leads to a future beneficial trade.\n\n### Current Resource Values\nThe values of the resources are already given. Ore has the highest value (38), followed by Brick (24), Sheep (13), Wood (11), and Wheat (6).\n\n### First Turn Action\nLet's examine potential trades. Since Ore is the most valuable resource, we should avoid giving it away unless necessary. Brick is also quite valuable.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering resources of lower value (like Wheat or Wood) for resources of higher value or maintaining our current high-value resources.\n\nLet's make an initial offer to see how the opponent responds. We'll offer something that might be attractive to them but also beneficial or neutral for us.\n\n### Offer\nWe have an abundance of Wheat and Brick. Let's offer some Wheat for a resource that could potentially be valuable or is at least not Wheat.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Wood]'\n\nThis is a relatively neutral or slightly beneficial trade for us since Wood (Value: 11) is more valuable than Wheat (Value: 6). Let's see the opponent's response.\n\n### Response Waiting\nAwaiting the opponent's response to '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Wood]'...\n\nSince I don't have the opponent's response, I will directly provide the action in the required format.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Wood]'",

Trading some of the lower-value resources or those we have in abundance for something more valuable or needed could be beneficial.\n\n5. **Possible Trade:**\n   - Consider offering some Wheat (lower value) for something more valuable. However, we need to be cautious about what Player 1 is willing to accept or offer.\n   - One potential trade could involve offering Wheat for another resource. Given that Wood was previously requested by Player 1, we might consider offering for something else they might be willing to give.\n\n6. **Action:**\n   Let's consider offering some Brick (which we have in abundance and is valuable) for Ore or other valuable resources. However, since we already have a decent amount of Ore, let's think about what else could be beneficial.\n\n   A potential offer: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]`\n\n   Let's calculate the value of this proposed trade:\n   - Offered: 3 Wheat (Value: 18) + 2 Brick (Value: 48) = Value: 66\n   - Requested: 1 Ore (Value: 38) + 1 Sheep (Value: 13) = Value: 51\n\n   This trade is not favorable as it stands because we're losing value. Let's adjust our strategy.\n\n   An alternative offer could be: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n   - Offered: 5 Wheat (Value: 30)\n   - Requested: 1 Sheep (Value: 13)\n\n   Still not very favorable. Let's think about directly involving higher-value items or reconsidering the quantities.\n\n### Decision\n\nLet's directly propose a trade that involves resources we have in surplus or are relatively lower in value for those that are higher or could be more beneficial.\n\n`[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep]` \n- Offered: 2 Wheat (Value: 12) + 1 Wood (Value: 11) = Value: 23\n- Requested: 2 Sheep (Value: 26)\n\nThis trade slightly increases our total value.\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\n`[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep]`",

We then need to consider what we can offer that might be more acceptable to both parties.\n\nLet's directly analyze making a new offer.\n\n## Step 1: Evaluate Current State\nWe have 12 Wheat, 10 Wood, 7 Sheep, 25 Brick, and 12 Ore.\n\n## Step 2: Consider a New Offer\nTo increase our total value, we should look to trade resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable. Given our resources and their values, one potential trade could involve offering Wheat (Value: 6) or Brick (Value: 24) for Ore (Value: 38) or possibly Sheep (Value: 13) if it can be done at a favorable rate.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a New Offer\nLet's consider offering some Brick for Ore since Ore is very valuable. We could offer something like: [Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore].\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the New Total Value for the Proposed Offer\nIf Player 1 accepts [Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]:\n- Brick: 25 - 3 = 22\n- Ore: 12 + 1 = 13\n\nNew Values:\n- Brick: 22 * 24 = 528\n- Ore: 13 * 38 = 494\n\nOther values remain the same. The new total value would be: 72 (Wheat) + 110 (Wood) + 91 (Sheep) + 528 (Brick) + 494 (Ore) = 1295\n\nThis is still less than our initial total value after the first trade (1329), but it's a potential improvement over accepting Player 1's offer.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on the Action\nFirst, we deny Player 1's offer since it's not beneficial.\nThen, we make a new offer: [Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore].\n\nThe final action for this turn is:\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]",

We denied it.\n\n#### Decision Making\nLet's analyze the last offer made by Player 1: 1 Ore (Value = 38) for 2 Brick (Value = 24*2 = 48), 1 Wheat (Value = 6). The total value offered is 38, and the total value requested is 48 + 6 = 54. This is not a favorable trade for us.\n\nHowever, we need Ore, and its value is high. Let's consider making a new offer that could be beneficial.\n\n#### New Offer\nWe need to think about what we can offer that might be acceptable to both parties. Given the high value of Ore, let's consider offering something that includes a resource Player 1 might need.\n\nLet's make an offer: `[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]`.\n\nThe action to be taken is: `[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]`.",

      "response": "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Game Situation\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 16 - 4 = 12 (since we traded 4 Wheat for 1 Wood)  \n     Value: 12 * 6 = 72  \n   - Wood: 9 + 1 = 10  \n     Value: 10 * 11 = 110  \n   - Sheep: 7  \n     Value: 7 * 13 = 91  \n   - Brick: 25 - 2 + 0 (net change from previous trades) - 2 (latest trade) = 21  \n     Value: 21 * 24 = 504  \n   - Ore: 12 + 1 (from the latest accepted trade) = 13  \n     Value: 13 * 38 = 494  \n\n   Total Value = 72 + 110 + 91 + 504 + 494 = 1271\n\n2. **Previous Trades and Outcomes:**\n   - We offered 4 Wheat for 1 Wood, and it was accepted.\n   - We offered 3 Wheat, 2 Brick for 1 Ore, 1 Sheep, and it was rejected.\n   - Player 1 offered 1 Ore, 1 Sheep for 4 Brick, and we rejected.\n   - We offered 3 Brick for 1 Ore, and it was rejected.\n   - Player 1 offered 1 Ore for 3 Brick, 1 Wheat, and we rejected.\n   - We offered 2 Brick for 1 Ore, and it was rejected twice but accepted on the third attempt.\n   - Player 1 made an offer after our last accepted trade: 1 Ore for 3 Brick.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Last Trade and Current Offer:**\n   - Our last trade was 2 Brick for 1 Ore, which was accepted. This increased our Ore to 13 and decreased our Brick to 21.\n   - The current offer from Player 1 is 1 Ore for 3 Brick.\n\n4. **Decision Making:**\n   - If we accept Player 1's offer, we give 3 Brick and get 1 Ore.  \n     - New Brick quantity = 21 - 3 = 18  \n     - New Ore quantity = 13 + 1 = 14  \n     - Change in value = (3 * 24) - (1 * 38) = 72 - 38 = 34 (loss)\n\n   - Since accepting the offer results in a loss of value (34 units), it's not beneficial.\n\n5. **Formulating a Response:**\n   - We should deny the current offer since it's not in our favor.\n\n   - Considering our resources and the goal to increase total value, let's formulate a new offer. We should look for trades that give us more value than we give away.\n\n   - One potential trade could involve offering resources that are relatively less valuable to us and requesting resources that are more valuable.\n\n   - For instance, we could think about trading some Wheat (Value: 6) or Brick (Value: 24) for Ore (Value: 38) or Sheep (Value: 13) if possible, in a favorable ratio.\n\n   - Let's directly evaluate the resources and think of a reasonable trade.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the current situation and analysis, our best action is to deny the incoming offer and potentially make a new offer that could be beneficial.\n\n- **[Deny]** the current offer from Player 1.\n\nLet's consider making a new offer. We can offer something like 2 Wheat for 1 Sheep.\n\n- **[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]**\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\n### Action\n\n`[Deny]`  \n`[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`",
