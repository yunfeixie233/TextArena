      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, let's start by analyzing the current state of our resources and their associated values:\n\n1. **[Wheat]**: Qty: 8, Value: 6\n2. **[Wood]**: Qty: 17, Value: 12\n3. **[Sheep]**: Qty: 7, Value: 13\n4. **[Brick]**: Qty: 10, Value: 28\n5. **[Ore]**: Qty: 5, Value: 32\n\n### Initial Strategy\n\nTo maximize the total value of our resources, we need to strategically decide which resources to trade and what to request in return. A basic principle is to try to acquire resources with higher values and dispose of or trade resources with lower values.\n\n### Current Total Value\n\nLet's calculate the current total value of our resources:\n- Wheat: 8 * 6 = 48\n- Wood: 17 * 12 = 204\n- Sheep: 7 * 13 = 91\n- Brick: 10 * 28 = 280\n- Ore: 5 * 32 = 160\n\nTotal Value = 48 + 204 + 91 + 280 + 160 = 783\n\n### First Turn Strategy\n\nFor the first turn, we need to identify a potentially beneficial trade. Since **[Ore]** and **[Brick]** have the highest values among our resources, we should aim to either retain or acquire more of these if possible. \n\nLet's examine a potential trade:\n- We have a relatively high quantity of **[Wood]** (Value: 12), which is not as valuable as **[Ore]** or **[Brick]** but is still significant in quantity. Trading some **[Wood]** for a resource of higher value could be beneficial.\n\n### Trade Offer for Turn 1\n\nLet's propose a trade that involves offering some **[Wood]** in exchange for **[Ore]**, as **[Ore]** is one of the highest value resources and we are relatively low on it compared to its value.\n\n**Trade Offer**: `[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis offer is made with the idea that reducing our **[Wood]** by 5 units (valued at 12 each) and gaining 1 **[Ore]** (valued at 32) could be a good initial negotiation. The total value given is 5 * 12 = 60, and the total value received is 1 * 32 = 32. While this specific trade is not immediately beneficial in terms of value (since 60 > 32), it is a starting point for negotiation.\n\nHowever, to follow the instructions and provide a more reasonable initial offer, let's adjust our strategy to directly propose a trade that could be more balanced or beneficial.\n\n### Adjusted Trade Offer\n\nUpon reconsideration, a more strategic initial trade might involve trading a less valuable resource for a more valuable one or balancing the quantities to make the trade more appealing.\n\nLet's directly propose a potentially more appealing trade that also aligns with our goal:\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]`\n\nThis involves giving up:\n- 4 Wheat (4 * 6 = 24)\n- 3 Wood (3 * 12 = 36)\nTotal value given = 24 + 36 = 60\n\nAnd gaining:\n- 2 Brick (2 * 28 = 56)\n\nWhile this trade is not significantly beneficial (since 60 > 56), it's a starting negotiation point. Let's refine or adjust based on the response.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]`\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds to this offer.",
