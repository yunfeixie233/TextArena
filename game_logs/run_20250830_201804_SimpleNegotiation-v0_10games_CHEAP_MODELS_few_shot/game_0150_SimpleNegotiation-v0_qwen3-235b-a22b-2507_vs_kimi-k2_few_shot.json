Focus on trades that give me higher-value resources (Ore and Brick).\n- **Opponent's Rejections Indicate:**\n  - They likely value Ore more highly (as they denied my 5B->7O).\n  - They might also be hoarding Sheep (as they offered a Sheep trade earlier).\n\n### Trade Proposal (Turn 5)\n**Offer:** [Offer: 6 Wheat, 9 Brick -> 10 Ore, 7 Sheep]\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **My Gain:** 10 Ore (worth 15.91) and 7 Sheep (worth 3.96). Total gain: ~19.87.\n- **Their Gain:** 6 Wheat (worth 6) and 9 Brick (worth 25). Total gain: ~31.\n- **Appeal:** \n  - Provides them high-value Brick (their likely priority) and Wheat (likely needed).\n  - I get 10 Ore (increasing my Ore stash to 32) + 7 Sheep (minor gain but acceptable).\n- **Balance:** While they gain more \"value\" in raw numbers, Ore's high scarcity and my strategic need make it worthwhile.\n\nThis is my counter-proposal to rekindle negotiations and test if they\u2019ll part with Ore at this rate.",
