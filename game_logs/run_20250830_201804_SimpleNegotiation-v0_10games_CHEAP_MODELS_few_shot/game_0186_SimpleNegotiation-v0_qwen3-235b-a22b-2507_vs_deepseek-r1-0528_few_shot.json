This suggests they may be willing to overpay for these resources again.  \n\nGiven my current holdings:  \n- **Brick**: 14 (value 23 each)  \n- **Wheat**: 8 (value 5 each)  \n- **Ore**: 29 (value 39 each)  \n\nI propose a trade that leverages their preference for Brick and Wheat while boosting my value significantly:  \n- I offer **5 Brick** and **2 Wheat** (total value: \\(5 \\times 23 + 2 \\times 5 = 125\\))  \n- In return, I request **10 Ore** (total value: \\(10 \\times 39 = 390\\)).\n\nThis gives me a net gain of **+265** in value.
