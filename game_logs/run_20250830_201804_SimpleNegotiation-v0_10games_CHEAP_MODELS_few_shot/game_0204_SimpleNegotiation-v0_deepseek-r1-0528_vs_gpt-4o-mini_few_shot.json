      "response": "The current offer from Player 1 is highly unfavorable\u2014offering 3 Wheat (value 5) and 1 Wood (value 10) in exchange for 2 Ore (value 32) and 2 Brick (value 20). Accepting would cause a net loss of 79 in total value (gain 15+10=25, lose 64+40=104). Even though Player 1 has sought Ore and Brick earlier, this trade prioritizes their interests. Given the game's final turn, attempting such an imbalanced exchange or a new trade would risk value with no opportunity for adjustment.\n\nThus, I deny this offer and refrain from proposing a new trade at the 10th turn, as any new offer would not be resolved before the game ends.\n\n[Deny]",
