The last trade I proposed (3 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick) was turned down and there are only four turns left. Brick is the easiest of my surplus resources to part with (the lowest per-unit value), while Ore is the scarcest and highest-value thing I own. Rather than chase Brick that only yields 0.42 value per unit, I will try to unlock more Ore or Sheep, both of which are worth more per unit than Brick.\n\nObservations from earlier exchanges:  \n- Player 1 seemed willing to give away Brick to acquire Ore at 5:1 and 6:1 ratios.  \n- Player 1 rejected the over-loaded package of Wheat + Sheep for Ore, so simpler trades appear to be better.\n\nI therefore offer a single-unit swap that benefits both of us: I get value, and Player 1 continues stocking Brick while divesting a low-demand resource (Wood) for something he clearly values higher (Ore).\n\n[Offer: 4 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
