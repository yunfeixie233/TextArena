Specifically, giving up 3 Ore (valued at 108 total) for 5 Wood (valued at 60) would decrease my total worth by 48, which isn't beneficial.\n\nHowever, I'm open to negotiation and have an alternative proposal that could work for both of us. I'm willing to trade resources at a ratio that adds value to my holdings while offering you a useful mix:\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 4 Wood]\n\nThis trade is fair based on my valuations: I'd give up 2 Sheep (valued at 26) and 2 Wheat (valued at 10) for a total of 36, and in return, I'd receive 4 Wood valued at 48. This nets me a gain of 12 in total value.
