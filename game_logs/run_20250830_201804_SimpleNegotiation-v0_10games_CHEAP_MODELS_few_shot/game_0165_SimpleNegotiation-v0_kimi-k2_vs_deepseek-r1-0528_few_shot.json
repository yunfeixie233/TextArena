Reduce the effective 20-(13)=7 point surplus in Sheep (my least efficient good).\n2. Acquire more high-value Ore and Brick.\n3. Never part with Ore at only 40 points a pop.\n\nAnalysis\n- I just sold 5 Sheep at an effective ~26.6 points/sheep; that beat holding them at 13 each, was neutral for Brick (23), and good for Ore (40).  \n- Player 1 repeatedly tried to get 5\u20136 Sheep for 1\u20132 Brick or 1\u20132 Ore.  Clearly they covet Sheep highly, so I can press for better rates.\n\nNext offer\nI\u2019ll propose a slightly lighter ask for Sheep while still converting them at a profit.\n\n[Offer: 6 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Ore]",
