Your offer of '15 Wheat' (valued at 75) for '4 Ore' (valued at 148) was an attempt to gain significant value. Player 1 also didn't make a counter offer, which means it's still your turn to propose a trade.\n\nLet's rethink. Player 1 might be looking for a more balanced offer or perhaps doesn't value Ore as highly as you do.\n\nI want to increase my total value. Ore is my most valuable resource by unit, so acquiring more of it is generally good. Brick is also valuable. Wheat and Wood are less valuable. I have a decent amount of Wheat.\n\nConsider a trade that is still beneficial for me but might be more attractive to Player 1.\nInstead of offering a large quantity of low-value resources for high-value ones, let's try a smaller, more balanced approach.\n\nPerhaps Player 1 needs Wheat, but not 15 of them. Or maybe Player 1 has a lot of Ore and doesn't want to trade it.\n\nWhat if I try trading a medium-value resource for a high-value one, or attempt to significantly increase my quantity of Brick?\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, as it's my highest value resource. I should offer something Player 1 might actually want and value.\nPlayer 1 didn't counter, so it's hard to guess their needs.\n\nI have 23 Wheat. Trading some is good if I get high-value resources.\nI have 19 Wood.\nI have 5 Sheep. These are quite valuable. I should be careful trading them.\nI have 9 Brick.\nI have 22 Ore.\n\nMy offer of 15 Wheat for 4 Ore was rejected. That's 75 value offered for 148 value requested. It was quite greedy.\nLet's try something less aggressive, but still beneficial.\n\nWhat about a smaller amount of Wheat for Ore?\nMaybe 10 Wheat (Value 50) for 2 Ore (Value 74). This is still a good gain for me.\n\nOr what about trading some Wood, which I have a decent amount of and which is relatively low value, for Ore or Brick?\nFor example, 10 Wood (Value 80) for 3 Ore (Value 111). This is still a good gain.\n\nLet's try to get Brick this time, as I have less Brick than Ore.\nOffer: 10 Wheat (Val 50) -> 3 Brick (Val 66). This is a decent gain.\nOffer: 12 Wood (Val 96) -> 5 Brick (Val 110). Also good.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again, but scale down the offer.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\nMy value: 10 * 5 = 50\nRequested value: 2 * 37 = 74\nGain for me: 24\n\nThis is a good gain, and 10 Wheat is less extreme than 15.
