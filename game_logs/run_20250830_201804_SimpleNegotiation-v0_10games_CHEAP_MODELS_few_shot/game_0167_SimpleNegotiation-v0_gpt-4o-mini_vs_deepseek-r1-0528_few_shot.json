      "response": "After reviewing the trade history and current resource values, I see that trading Ore for Brick has been profitable due to Brick's higher per-unit value (approximately 3.6667 vs. Ore's 1.6818). However, Player 0 rejected my last offer of 5 Ore for 3 Brick, suggesting they may be low on Brick or seeking better terms. To adapt, I'll propose a new trade that bundles Sheep (my lowest-value resource at 0.9286 per unit) with Ore to incentivize Player 0 while still increasing my total value.\n\n**New Trade Offer:**  \nI offer 5 Sheep and 2 Ore in exchange for 3 Brick.  \n- Value given: (5 \u00d7 0.9286) + (2 \u00d7 1.6818) \u2248 4.643 + 3.3636 = 8.0066  \n- Value received: 3 \u00d7 3.6667 \u2248 11.0001  \n- **Net gain:** \u2248 2.9935  \n\nThis leverages Player 0's past acceptance of Sheep (e.g., Turn 1) and maintains pressure on Brick acquisition. If rejected, I'll pivot to Wood-focused trades next turn.\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 3 Brick]",
