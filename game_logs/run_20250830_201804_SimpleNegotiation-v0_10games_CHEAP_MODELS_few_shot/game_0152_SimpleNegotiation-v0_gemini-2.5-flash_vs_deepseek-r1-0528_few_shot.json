However, Player 1 rejected this before.\n\nLet's reconsider the previous successful transaction:\nPlayer 1 offered 3 Sheep (value 45) for 12 Wheat (value 72). This was a losing trade for me (I accept 45 value for 72 value). I need to be more careful.\n\nI have accepted two of these losing trades previously. This means my Wheat quantity will be lower, so I'm closer to balancing my resources, but it doesn't align with increasing total value.\n\nMy goal is to increase the TOTAL value of my resources.\nCurrent total value: (24*6) + (20*11) + (12*15) + (21*28) + (20*40) = 144 + 220 + 180 + 588 + 800 = 1932.\n\nLet's evaluate the offer from player 1 again: 3 Wood (value 33) for 1 Ore (value 40).\nThis is a bad trade for me as I lose 7 value. I should reject this.\n\nWhat trade can I propose that increases my value?\nI want to trade low-value items for high-value items, or trade items I have in surplus for items I need.\n\nI have a large quantity of Wheat (24).\nI have a large quantity of Brick (21).\n\nLet's try to get more Ore or Brick.\n\nConsider trading Wheat for Brick.\nWhat if I offer 5 Wheat (value 30) for 1 Brick (value 28)? This is a bad trade for me.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore (value 40) for 2 Wool (value 30)? Bad for me.\n\nLet's look at what Player 1 asked for previously: Ore for Wood. They clearly valued Ore highly.\n\nWhat if I give away some Wheat to get some higher value items?\nIf I offer 10 Wheat (value 60) for 3 Brick (value 84)? This would be beneficial for me (+24 value).\nOr 10 Wheat (value 60) for 4 Sheep (value 60)? This is value neutral but helps balance resources.\n\nLet's propose a trade that benefits me significantly.\nI will offer a reasonable amount of my lower value resource (Wheat) for a better resource.\n\nI will reject player 1's undesirable offer.\nThen offer something that benefits me.\n\nDecision: Deny the offer 3 Wood <-> 1 Ore.\nProposed new offer: 10 Wheat (value 60) for 3 Brick (value 84).
