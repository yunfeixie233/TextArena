The resources with the highest values per unit are Ore (38), Brick (28), Sheep (13), Wood (11), and Wheat (6). \n\nGiven my current resources, I have a significant amount of Ore, which is the highest value resource. I should try to keep as much Ore as possible while trading other resources for Brick, as it's the next highest valued resource I don't have a lot of.\n\n### Turn 1\n\nI will start by offering some of my lower-value resources for Brick. I have a decent amount of Wood and Sheep, which are of moderate value. I'll offer some Wood for Brick.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n\nLet's see the response from the opponent.\n\n### Waiting for Opponent's Response...\n\nSince there's no response or offer to react to in this turn, I'll proceed with my initial plan.\n\nLet's assume the opponent doesn't make an offer this turn. I will stick with my initial offer.\n\n### Next Step\n\nIf the opponent doesn't respond or make a counteroffer, I will continue to negotiate. \n\nFor now, my action remains:\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Brick]",

This is not a favorable trade for Player 1 but could be seen as an attempt to initiate a potentially more beneficial trade in the future or a genuine need for Wheat.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven the current situation, we need to decide whether to accept, deny, or make a counteroffer.\n\n1. **Accepting the Offer:** [Accept]\n   - We gain 1 Wood (Value: 11) and lose 1 Wheat (Value: 6).\n   - Net gain: +5 in value.\n\n2. **Denying the Offer:** [Deny]\n   - No change in resources.\n\n3. **Making a Counteroffer:**\n   - We need to think of a trade that is beneficial to us and potentially acceptable to Player 1.\n\n### Action\n\nAccepting the offer gives us a net gain in value. Therefore, I will choose to accept the offer.\n\n**Action:** [Accept]\n\nThis decision aligns with our goal of increasing the total value of our resources.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nAfter accepting the trade, our resources will be:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 12   Value: 6\n- [Wood]    Qty: 24   Value: 11\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 15   Value: 13\n- [Brick]   Qty: 6    Value: 28\n- [Ore]     Qty: 23   Value: 38\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation and make future decisions based on the next offers or needs. \n\nLet's proceed to the next turn.",

Given the current quantities and values:\n- I have a significant amount of Wood, Sheep, and Ore.\n- Brick is relatively valuable but scarce with me.\n\nConsidering the resources I have and their values, a potentially beneficial trade could involve exchanging some of my less valuable resources for more valuable ones or gaining more quantity of a valuable resource.\n\nLet's examine a potential trade:\n- I can offer some Wheat (Value: 6) or Wood (Value: 11) since I have a decent quantity of both.\n- I can try to get more Brick (Value: 28) or keep the status quo if possible.\n\nGiven that I previously tried to get Brick and was rejected, and now I have more Wood, I can try to propose a trade that might be more appealing to Player 1.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n\nThis offer gives Player 1 a significant quantity of Wood (Value: 11 each) in exchange for 1 Brick (Value: 28), which could be an attractive deal.\n\nSo, my action for this turn is:\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
