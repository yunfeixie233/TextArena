I should not accept this exact offer again.\n\nI need to make an offer that increases my value. I have a lot of Sheep. Ore is my most valuable resource per unit and I have little of it.

No.\n\nLet's try to get more of the high-value items (Brick, Ore) by trading lower-value items (Wheat, Wood, Sheep).\n\nWhat about trading some of my abundant Sheep for Ore?\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\nMy value: 5 * 17 = 85\nPlayer 0's value: 2 * 33 = 66\nThis is bad for Player 0.

I lose 1.\nI still have a good amount of Sheep (20).\n\nI will deny this specific offer as it results in a loss for me.\nThen I will make my own offer.\nI want to trade my less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nI have 10 Wheat (60).\nI have 15 Wood (120).\nI have 20 Sheep (340).\nI have 16 Brick (336).\nI have 6 Ore (198).\n\nI value Ore the most (33).\nI value Brick second (21).\nI value Sheep third (17).\nI value Wood fourth (8).\nI value Wheat fifth (6).\n\nLet's try to trade some Wheat or Wood for something better.\nHow about trading Wheat for Brick?\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nMy value: 4 * 6 = 24\nPlayer 0's value: 1 * 21 = 21\n\nThis is slightly in my favor.
