Wheat has the lowest per-unit value for me (6) whereas Ore is the highest (36).  \n2. Brick is valuable as well (24) but I have very little (6). If I can convert Ore \u2192 Brick at a decent rate I gain ~12 value per brick (36-24). Same goes for Sheep \u2192 Brick.\n\nSo I still want either (a) Brick for my high-value Ore or (b) high-value resources for my low-value Wheat. You obviously want Ore, so the natural win-win is \u201cgive me high-value resources; give you Ore at a reasonable mark-up.\u201d\n\nA moment from the earlier proposals:\n- Initial: 2 Ore (72 value) + 2 Wheat (12 value) \u2192 3 Brick (72 value). Net neutral value on the trade, but positional gain for me in Brick scarcity. You denied it.  \nI can tweak that package to be more attractive to you.\n\nRevised offer\n\n[Offer: 3 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 4 Brick, 1 Wood]\n\nExplanation for our chat\n- I\u2019m adding an extra Ore (value 36) and a Wheat (low value filler) to sweeten the deal.  \n- In exchange I ask for 4 Brick (4\u00d724 = 96 value) + 1 Wood (10 value), total received 106 value.  \n- Value out = 3\u00d736 + 1\u00d76 = 108. Value in = 4\u00d724 + 1\u00d710 = 106. The net differential (-2 value) is minimal for me (rounding error of 1/650) but the mix improves my portfolio: Brick jumps from 6 to 10, and I gain a versatile Wood.  \nFor you the value out (106) is modestly less than the incoming 108, but you desperately want Ore, so this may yet be acceptable.\n\nLet\u2019s see if you like it or wish to negotiate.\n\n[Offer: 3 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 4 Brick, 1 Wood]",
