They might still be interested in Ore or Brick.\n3. **Make a Competitive Offer**: Given current resources and in light of Player 1's past offers, I will attempt to initiate a new trade.\n\n### Next Offer:\nConsidering Player 0 needs Brick and has excess Wood, I will offer:\n- **[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]** \n\nThis offer aims to exchange surplus resources for a more valuable commodity. \n\nNow let's proceed with my offer:\n- **[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]**",
