      "response": "Thought process:\n\n1. **Current Resource Valuation**: \n   - My total current value is: (20 Wheat * 6) + (7 Wood * 8) + (6 Sheep * 12) + (6 Brick * 28) + (19 Ore * 32) = 120 + 56 + 72 + 168 + 608 = 1024.\n\n2. **Game Progress**: \n   - It's currently turn 5 (out of 10), so we have 5 turns left. My opponent has rejected all offers so far, so they might be holding out for better deals or don't need what I'm offering.\n\n3. **Resource Priorities**:\n   - **Brick** is highly valuable (28). I only have 6, so acquiring more Brick would significantly boost my total value.\n   - **Sheep** and **Wood** are the least valuable among my resources (12 and 8). I should prioritize trading these away.\n   - **Ore** is the most valuable (32), but I have a decent amount (19). It's not urgent to trade Ore unless it's for high-value returns.\n\n4. **Opponent's Likely Needs**:\n   - The opponent has rejected offers involving Sheep, Wood, and Ore for Brick. They might either not need these or value them lower than the market. Alternatively, they might be low on Brick themselves.\n\n5. **New Offer Strategy**:\n   - Focus on trading **Sheep** and **Wood**, as these are the least valuable to me. \n   - Request more **Brick** in return, but ensure the offer is attractive enough to not be rejected again.\n   - A better ratio: instead of 6 Sheep + 6 Wood for 7 Brick (rejected), I could offer 6 Sheep for 5 Brick (roughly compensating Brick's high value).\n\n6. **Alternative Trade**:\n   - If the opponent still seems reluctant, I might need to offer **Ore** since it's more attractive. For instance, 3 Ore for 5 Brick (167 value for 140 Brick value, slightly favoring the opponent but still beneficial).\n\n7. **Choosing the Offer**:\n   - Given the opponent's reluctance, I'll try a more balanced offer: **3 Sheep + 2 Wood for 3 Brick** (36 + 16 = 52 given, 84 received, net gain of 32). This seems fair and targets their potential Brick surplus without overpaying.\n\nFinal action:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]",
