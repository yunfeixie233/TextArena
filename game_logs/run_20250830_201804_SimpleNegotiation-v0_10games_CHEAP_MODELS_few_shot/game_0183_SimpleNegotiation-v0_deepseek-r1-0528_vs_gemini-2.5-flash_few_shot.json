      "response": "The game has started!\nYou are Player 1.\nYour resources:\n- Wheat: 21 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 23 (Value: 11)\n- Sheep: 8 (Value: 12)\n- Brick: 6 (Value: 29)\n- Ore: 17 (Value: 33)\n\nThe opponent (Player 0) offered: 3 Wood for 1 Ore.\n\nLet's analyze the offer.\nPlayer 0 wants 1 Ore (Value: 33).\nPlayer 0 is offering 3 Wood (Value: 3 * 11 = 33).\n\nThis offer is value-neutral for me. I would neither gain nor lose value. My goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Accepting this offer won't help me achieve that.\n\nI will formulate a counter-offer. I want to trade away resources I have in abundance or less valuable ones for more valuable resources.\n\nMy current resources and their values:\n- Wheat: 21 (Value: 6) - Low value, high quantity.\n- Wood: 23 (Value: 11) - Mid value, high quantity.\n- Sheep: 8 (Value: 12) - Mid value, mid quantity.\n- Brick: 6 (Value: 29) - High value, low quantity.\n- Ore: 17 (Value: 33) - Highest value, mid quantity.\n\nI want to acquire more Brick or Ore. I have a lot of Wood and Wheat.\n\nLet's try to trade some Wood and Wheat for Ore or Brick.\n\nConsider selling Wood. If I sell Wood, I want something of higher value.\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of Wood for a single unit of Ore?\nCurrently, 3 Wood = 33 value, and 1 Ore = 33 value. That's a neutral trade.\n\nI need to make an offer that is beneficial to *me*.\nPerhaps I can offer a combination of lower-value resources for a higher-value one.\n\nLet's try offering a mix of Wood and Wheat for Ore, aiming for a net gain.\nIf I give 4 Wood (4 * 11 = 44) and ask for 2 Ore (2 * 33 = 66), that's a good deal for me. But Player 0 probably won't accept it.\n\nLet's stick to a simpler offer for now, leveraging my high quantity of Wood.\nI have a lot of Wood (23 units). Maybe I can trade 5 Wood for 1 Ore.\nMy value in 5 Wood = 5 * 11 = 55.\nValue of 1 Ore = 33. This is a very bad deal for me.\n\nThe opponent offered 3 Wood for 1 Ore. This is a 1:1 value trade.\nI should aim for a trade where I get more value than I give.\n\nWhat if I try to get some Brick? Brick is valuable (29).\nI have a lot of Wood. What if I offer Wood for Brick?\n3 Wood is 33 value. 1 Brick is 29 value. If I offer 3 Wood for 1 Brick, I lose 4 value.\n\nOkay, let's look at the resources I have a lot of: Wheat (21) and Wood (23).\nAnd what I want: Ore (33) and Brick (29).\n\nPlayer 0's offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore (Value: 33 -> 33)\n\nI need to make a counter-offer that gains me value.\nCan I offer some Wood and Wheat for Ore?\nLet's try to offer low-value resources for high-value resources.\n\nHow about trading a lot of Wheat for a single Ore?\nValue of 1 Ore = 33.\nValue of Wheat = 6. I'd need 6 Wheat (6*6 = 36) for 1 Ore. This is a small gain for me (36 given for 33 received in value). This might be acceptable.\n\nLet's try a slight variation. Offer Wheat for Brick.\nValue of 1 Brick = 29.\nValue of 5 Wheat = 5 * 6 = 30. This is a good trade for me, a gain of 1 value if accepted.\nHowever, I have only 6 Brick. Maybe Player 0 wants Brick.\n\nI'll reject their current offer as it gives no value gain.\nThen I will make my own offer.\n\nI want to consolidate my resources into fewer, more valuable types.\nI have a good amount of Wood and Wheat.\n\nLet's propose: I give 3 Wood and 1 Wheat in exchange for 2 Ore.\nValue offered: (3 * 11) + (1 * 6) = 33 + 6 = 39.\nValue requested: (2 * 33) = 66.\nThis is a tremendous gain for me (+27 value). Player 0 will likely deny this.\n\nI need to make a more realistic offer where I still gain value but it's not overly greedy.\nLet's offer a larger quantity of lower-value items for fewer, higher-value items.\n\nHow about 5 Wood for 2 Ore?\nValue offered: 5 * 11 = 55.\nValue requested: 2 * 33 = 66.\nThis is a gain of 11 value for me. This might be a viable offer. Player 0 gets a better deal per unit of Ore.\n\nLet's evaluate the offer they made again: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore. (Value 33 -> 33).\nI want more value.\n\nWhat if I offer 4 Wood and 1 Wheat for 1 Ore?\nMy side: 4 Wood (4*11=44) + 1 Wheat (1*6=6) = 50 value.\nTheir side: 1 Ore (33 value).\nThis is a very bad trade for me. I would lose 17 value. This is not how negotiation works for me.\n\nI need to give less valuable resources and receive more valuable resources.\n\nLet's think about what Player 0 might want. They initially offered to give 3 Wood for 1 Ore. This means they are willing to part with Wood and want Ore.\n\nWhat if I offer less Ore for more Wood? No, that's not what I want.\n\nMy goal is to increase *my* total value.\n\nLet's focus on offloading Wheat and getting something more valuable.\nI have 21 Wheat (Value 6).\nIf I give 5 Wheat (30 Value), I want something worth more than 30.\nI could ask for 1 Brick (29 Value). That would be a loss of 1 value.\nI could ask for 1 Ore (33 Value). That would be a gain of 3 value for me.\n\nSo, 5 Wheat for 1 Ore seems like a good target.\nValue given: 5 * 6 = 30.\nValue received: 1 * 33 = 33.\nThis is a gain of 3 for me. It's a modest gain, which might make it acceptable for Player 0.\n\nLet's try this offer.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "[Deny]  \n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]  \n\n### Explanation:  \n- I declined Player 1's offer of 4 Wheat for 1 Ore because it would reduce my total value (losing 34-value Ore for 20-value Wheat, net loss of 14).  \n- I proposed a new trade: offering 2 Wood (value: 20) for 1 Ore (value: 34). If accepted, this would increase my total value by 14.  \n- With 20 Wood in inventory, I prioritize converting lower-value Wood (10 per unit) into higher-value Ore (34 per unit) for profit. The game has one turn left, so this aggressive offer maximizes upside potential.  \n\n**Current Resources After Prior Trades** (for reference):  \n- Wheat: 9 (value: 5 each)  \n- Wood: 20 (value: 10 each)  \n- Sheep: 12 (value: 13 each)  \n- Brick: 18 (value: 27 each)  \n- Ore: 12 (value: 34 each)  \n- **Total Value**: 1,295",
