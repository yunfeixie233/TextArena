The value for those 5 Ore would be 185 (5 x 37).\n\nCalculating the gain here:\n- Total value before trade: 19 Brick (399) + 30 Ore (1110) = 1509\n- Total value after trade: (19 - 3) Brick (336) + (30 + 5) Ore (1365) = 1701\n- Value increase: 1701 - 1509 = 192\n\nConsidering this substantial gain, it would be beneficial to accept the offer from Player 0.\n\n**Player 1's action:**\n[Accept]",

A straight 3-for-5 would be an even better deal.  If Player 1 declines, however, I still have abundant Brick to back down.  So I push the next logical step.\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 5 Ore]",
