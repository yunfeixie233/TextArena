Given that Player 1 rejected the last offer (4 Sheep, 1 Brick for 2 Wheat, 3 Wood), they likely value Wood or Wheat highly. \n\nA better offer might be to trade away more Wheat (low value) for Ore (high value). However, I already have a lot of Ore. Instead, I should aim for more Brick.\n\nPropose trading away Sheep (value 18) for Brick (value 20), as this would be a net gain per unit (1 Brick is worth more than 1 Sheep).\n\n**Offer**: Give 5 Sheep (total value 90) for 3 Brick (total value 60). This seems like a loss, but actually Sheep is 18 each, and Brick is 20 each, so 5 Sheep = 90, 3 Brick = 60 is a loss. This is bad math. \n\nRecalculate:\n- 5 Sheep (5 \u00d7 18 = 90) for 4 Brick (4 \u00d7 20 = 80) is also a loss.\n- 3 Sheep (54) for 2 Brick (40) is a loss.\n\nThis suggests trading Sheep for Brick is not good, as Sheep is more valuable per unit. \n\nInstead, trade Wheat (5) for Brick (20) or Ore (39), or Wood (11) for Brick or Ore.\n\nBetter approach: Trade Wood (11) for Brick (20) or Ore (39).\n\nPropose trading **5 Wood (total 55) for 2 Ore (total 78)**.
