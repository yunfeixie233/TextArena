      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, let's start by analyzing the resources and their values:\n\n1. **[Wheat]**: Qty: 24, Value: 5\n2. **[Wood]**: Qty: 9, Value: 10\n3. **[Sheep]**: Qty: 9, Value: 17\n4. **[Brick]**: Qty: 6, Value: 22\n5. **[Ore]**: Qty: 5, Value: 38\n\nThe total value of the resources I currently have is calculated as follows:\n- Wheat: 24 * 5 = 120\n- Wood: 9 * 10 = 90\n- Sheep: 9 * 17 = 153\n- Brick: 6 * 22 = 132\n- Ore: 5 * 38 = 190\n\nTotal Value = 120 + 90 + 153 + 132 + 190 = 685\n\n### Strategy for Turn 1\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I need to make strategic trades. The goal is to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or to negotiate a beneficial exchange.\n\nLooking at the values:\n- The highest value resource I have is Ore (38).\n- The lowest value resource I have is Wheat (5).\n\nA potential strategy could involve offering Wheat for other resources that might be more valuable or at least equally beneficial in terms of future trades.\n\n### Trade Offer for Turn 1\n\nLet's propose a trade that could potentially increase my total resource value. Since Wheat is of the lowest value and I have a considerable quantity, I'll offer some Wheat in exchange for a resource that could be valuable.\n\nFor Turn 1, I'll make the following offer:\n`[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Wood]`\n\nThis translates to offering 8 units of Wheat (total value of 8*5 = 40) for 2 units of Wood (total value of 2*10 = 20). While this specific trade doesn't increase my total value directly (since I'm giving away resources worth 40 for resources worth 20), it's not a good trade.\n\nLet's think about a better trade.\n\n### Alternative Trade Offer\n\nConsidering the resource values again, let's think about a more strategic trade. I have a significant quantity of Sheep (Value: 17) and not as much Brick (Value: 22) or Ore (Value: 38).\n\nFor Turn 1, an alternative offer could be:\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]`\n\nThis means offering 4 Wheat (4*5 = 20) and 1 Sheep (1*17 = 17) for 2 Brick (2*22 = 44). The total value offered is 20 + 17 = 37, and the total value requested is 44, which is a gain.\n\nLet's proceed with this offer.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]`",

      "response": "### Step 1: Analyze the Current State\n\nAfter the last turn, the resources I have are:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 14   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 9    Value: 10\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 9    Value: 17\n- [Brick]   Qty: 6    Value: 22\n- [Ore]     Qty: 6    Value: 38\n\nThe total value of my resources is:  \n(14 * 5) + (9 * 10) + (9 * 17) + (6 * 22) + (6 * 38) = 70 + 90 + 153 + 132 + 228 = 673\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Last Trade and Response\n\nThe last trade offer I made was:  \n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]  \nPlayer 1 rejected this offer.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Next Action\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I need to consider what resources are valuable and how to acquire them. Given the values:\n- [Ore] is the most valuable, and I have increased my quantity to 6 after the last accepted trade.\n- [Brick] is the second most valuable resource I have.\n\nSince my last offer for 1 Brick was rejected, I need to rethink the offer. Considering the values, acquiring more [Ore] or [Brick] would be beneficial.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate a New Trade Offer\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n1. Offering [Wheat] for [Brick] or [Ore] since [Wheat] has the lowest value.\n2. I have 14 [Wheat], so I can offer some for a more valuable resource.\n\nGiven that my last offer for 1 [Brick] was rejected, I might need to offer more [Wheat] for it. Let's try offering more [Wheat] for 1 [Brick] or consider offering for 1 [Ore].\n\nFor 1 [Ore], I previously offered 5 [Wheat] and was accepted. This seems like a good ratio, but I need to check if I can get a better deal for [Brick].\n\n### Step 5: Decide on the Trade\n\nLet's offer 7 [Wheat] for 1 [Brick] this time, as my previous offer of 4 [Wheat] for 1 [Brick] was rejected. The calculation for this trade is:\n- Giving up: 7 * 5 = 35\n- Receiving: 1 * 22 = 22\nThis trade is not favorable as it results in a net loss of value (35 - 22 = 13). So, let's think about other options.\n\nAlternatively, I can offer [Sheep] for [Ore] or [Brick]. [Sheep] has a value of 17, which is less than [Ore] but more than [Brick]. \n\nLet's directly check offering [Wheat] or [Sheep] for [Ore] since it's the most valuable:\n- Offering 3 [Sheep] for 1 [Ore]:  \n  - Giving up: 3 * 17 = 51  \n  - Receiving: 1 * 38 = 38  \n  This is not favorable.\n\nLet's think about making a more reasonable offer for [Brick] since it's less valuable than [Ore]:\n- I could offer 2 [Sheep] for 1 [Brick]:  \n  - Giving up: 2 * 17 = 34  \n  - Receiving: 1 * 22 = 22  \n  This is still not favorable.\n\n### Step 6: Make the Trade Offer\n\nAfter evaluating, let's make an offer that could be reasonable and check the opponent's response.\n\nLet's offer: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\n\nThe response to this offer will determine the next step.\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 0 Sheep, 0 Wood, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wheat, 0 Sheep, 0 Wood, 1 Brick, 0 Ore]\n\n### Simplified Format\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

It\u2019s break-even on this single trade, but it both improves deck composition (who needs 13 Wheat anyway?) and may open room for bigger, value-added exchanges in later turns.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
