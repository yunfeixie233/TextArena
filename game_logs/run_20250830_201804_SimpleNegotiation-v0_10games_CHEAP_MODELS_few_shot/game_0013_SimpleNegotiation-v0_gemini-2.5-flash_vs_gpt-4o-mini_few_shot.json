      "response": "Okay, as Player 0, I've just had an offer accepted! That's good. My resources have changed. I need to re-evaluate my current inventory and total value, and then make my next move.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the new state and my plan:\n\n**Current Resources (after previous trade):**\n\n*   **Initial Resources:**\n    *   [Wheat] Qty: 20 Value: 6\n    *   [Wood] Qty: 22 Value: 11\n    *   [Sheep] Qty: 5 Value: 18\n    *   [Brick] Qty: 13 Value: 20\n    *   [Ore] Qty: 9 Value: 33\n*   **Trade Performed:** [Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Wood]\n    *   **Offered:** 3 Sheep (3 * 18 = 54 value), 1 Ore (1 * 33 = 33 value)\n        *   New Sheep Qty: 5 - 3 = 2\n        *   New Ore Qty: 9 - 1 = 8\n    *   **Requested:** 5 Brick (5 * 20 = 100 value), 2 Wood (2 * 11 = 22 value)\n        *   New Brick Qty: 13 + 5 = 18\n        *   New Wood Qty: 22 + 2 = 24\n\n**Updated Resources:**\n\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 20 Value: 6 (Total Value: 120)\n*   [Wood] Qty: 24 Value: 11 (Total Value: 264)\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 2 Value: 18 (Total Value: 36)\n*   [Brick] Qty: 18 Value: 20 (Total Value: 360)\n*   [Ore] Qty: 8 Value: 33 (Total Value: 264)\n\n**Total Value Calculation:** 120 + 264 + 36 + 360 + 264 = 1044\n\nMy total value increased by (100+22) - (54+33) = 122 - 87 = 35. This is good.\n\n**Strategic Analysis for Next Turn:**\n\n*   I have very few Sheep now (2).\n*   I have a good amount of Wheat, Wood, and Brick.\n*   Ore is my most valuable resource per unit, and I still have 8.\n*   I want to keep increasing my total value. This usually means trading less valuable resources for more valuable ones, or trading resources I have in surplus for ones I need to balance my portfolio or prepare for larger trades.\n\n**Offer Strategy:**\n\nGiven my current inventory, I might want to streamline some of my mid-value resources (Wood, Brick) for higher value ones like Ore, or to increase my very low Sheep quantity if I think it will be useful in later trades. I have a lot of Brick and Wood. I could try to trade some of those for Ore.\n\nLet's try to offer a mix of Brick and Wood for Ore.\n\n[Offer: 6 Brick, 3 Wood -> 3 Ore]\n*   Offered value: (6 * 20) + (3 * 11) = 120 + 33 = 153\n*   Requested value: (3 * 33) = 99\nThis offer gives me a value deficit, but it consolidates resources and gets me valuable Ore. Maybe too much of a deficit.\n\nLet's try to make a more balanced offer, perhaps prioritizing getting more Ore. I still have a lot of Brick.\n[Offer: 5 Brick, 1 Wood -> 2 Ore]\n*   Offered value: (5 * 20) + (1 * 11) = 111\n*   Requested value: (2 * 33) = 66\nThis is an even worse value proposition for me. I should be getting value, not losing it.\n\nPlayer 1 accepted my last offer, which means they might be open to trades that benefit them. I need to make an offer that is *slightly* favorable to them while being *very* favorable to me in terms of long-term strategy (consolidating value, getting rid of less valuable resources, gaining highly valuable ones).\n\nI have a large quantity of Brick and Wood. I should try to offload some of them for Ore.\n\nLet's try this:\n**[Offer: 6 Brick -> 3 Ore]**\n*   Offered Value: 6 * 20 = 120\n*   Requested Value: 3 * 33 = 99\nValue seems off for me. Player 1 would like this, I want to gain value.\n\nHow about trying to convert some of my cheaper resources into something that's harder to come by or has a higher unit value, without overpaying too much for it?\n\nI have a low amount of Sheep. Maybe Player 1 has a surplus of Sheep and would give it to me for some of my many Bricks or Woods.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore for my abundant Brick or Wood.\n[Offer: 5 Brick, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]\nValue offered: (5 * 20) + (2 * 11) = 100 + 22 = 122\nValue requested: 2 * 33 = 66\nThis is bad for me in terms of immediate value.\n\nI should leverage my high quantities of certain resources. I also want to make offers that are likely to be accepted.\n\nLet's rethink. I have 18 Brick and 24 Wood. These are my highest quantities. Ore is my most valuable per unit.\n\nOffer to gain Ore:\nI want to gain 1 Ore (33 value). What can I give for it?\nMaybe a few Wheat (6), or a few Wood (11), or a few Brick (20).\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nOffered Value: 2 * 20 = 40\nRequested Value: 1 * 33 = 33\nThis would gain me value (33-40 = -7 value change) immediately but consolidate high quantity low value stuff for high value low quantity stuff. Player 1 might accept this since it's only slightly negative for them.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
