Current state  \n   - I am Player 1, symbol 'X'.  \n   - Board:\n     - X: cell 0  \n     - O: cells 4 (center), 8 (bottom-right corner)  \n   - Available moves: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7  \n\n2. Win check  \n   - Do I have two X's in any line? No \u2014 only one X so far. Cannot win on this move.\n\n3. Block check  \n   - Does O have two in a row?  \n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: O has 4 and 8, I have 0 \u2192 O has two, but cannot complete because 0 is mine.  \n     - Row 6-7-8: O has 8, but 6 and 7 are empty \u2192 one O only.  \n     - Column 2-5-8: O has 8, others empty \u2192 only one.  \n   - So O cannot win next move. No immediate block needed.\n\n4. Strategic priorities  \n   - Corners: 0 (taken by me), 2, 6, 8 (taken by O) \u2192 available: 2, 6  \n   - Edges: 1, 3, 5, 7  \n   - Best move: take a corner to maintain balance and create potential forks.\n\n5. Evaluating corner choices  \n   - Corner 2 (top-right):  \n     - Completes top row (0-1-2) with me holding 0 and 2 \u2192 strong potential for row threat.  \n     - Also part of diagonal 2-4-6 \u2192 but 4 is O, so this would be a defensive diagonal unless I control both 2 and 6.  \n   - Corner 6 (bottom-left):  \n     - Part of left column (0-3-6): I have 0, so 6 would give me two in column.  \n     - Also diagonal 0-4-8 (blocked), 2-4-6? \u2192 O has 4, so again, not ideal.  \n     - But if I take 6, I have 0 and 6 \u2014 both left column, setting up 3 to complete.\n\n6. Fork potential  \n   - If I take corner 2, I have 0 and 2 \u2014 both in top row. Then if I later take 1, I win.  \n   - O may respond to block.\n   - Alternatively, if I take 6, I have 0 and 6 \u2014 left column. Then 3 would win.\n\n   But consider symmetry:  \n   - O has 8 \u2014 bottom-right. If I take 6 (bottom-left), I have both bottom corners.  \n   - But that gives O the center and diagonal strength.\n\n   Better: Take 2. Why?  \n   - Top row: 0 (X) \u2013 1 \u2013 2 (X) \u2192 O will be forced to block 1 eventually.  \n   - Diagonal 2-4-6: O holds 4, but if I get both 2 and 6, I have pressure.  \n   - Also, 2 is opposite to 6, but O doesn\u2019t have 6 yet.\n\n   However, more critical: **create opportunity for a fork later**.\n\n   Let\u2019s simulate:\n   - I play 2 \u2192 board: X | ? | X  \n   - O must respond carefully. If O plays 1 (to block top row), then I can play 6, threatening 0-3-6 (column) and maybe 6-7-8 (but 8 is O).  \n   - Better: I play 6 \u2192 X at 0 and 6 \u2192 threaten 3 to win column. O must respond.\n\n   But wait \u2014 better corner?\n\n   Alternative idea: **Take corner 6** instead?\n\n   - 0 and 6: both on left column \u2192 immediate two-in-column threat.  \n   - O will have to block 3 eventually if I pressure that.  \n   - Also, 6 opposes 2, avoids clustering at top.\n\n   But O has 8. If I take 6, O might take 2 or center-side edges.\n\n   Actually, symmetry suggests: when O takes opposite corner (8), best response is to take a third corner \u2014 doesn\u2019t matter which, as long as it\u2019s not adjacent.\n\n   But standard theory:  \n   - After:\n     - O: center\n     - X: corner (0)\n     - O: opposite corner (8)\n   - Best for X is to take **another corner**, not adjacent to both \u2014 so 2 or 6 are both fine.\n\n   However, **taking 6 (bottom-left)** gives:\n   - Left column: 0 and 6 \u2192 two in column \u2192 forces O to block 3 if I threaten.\n   - Also avoids giving O easy diagonal.\n\n   But **taking 2 (top-right)** gives top row: 0 and 2 \u2192 two in row \u2192 threat on 1.\n\n   Both are symmetrically similar.\n\n   But note: O has 8 \u2014 bottom-right.  \n   If I take 6 (bottom-left), and O already has 8, then O controls two bottom corners? Not dangerous, but no immediate row.\n\n   However, O cannot make bottom row because 7 is missing.\n\n   Decision: **take corner 2** \u2014 top-right.\n\n   Why?  \n   - Top row: 0 and 2 \u2192 both X \u2192 forces O to eventually block 1.  \n   - Later, I can play 6 or 3 to set up column or fork.\n\n   But wait \u2014 another option: **the best reply to center + opposite corner is actually to take a different corner**, and then force a draw at minimum. Either 2 or 6 is fine.\n\n   I'll pick 2 \u2014 top-right \u2014 to build top row.\n\n7. Conclusion  \nTake corner 2 to establish a two-in-a-row threat across the top and increase fork potential later.\n\n[2]",

Not dangerous, but no immediate row.\n\n   However, O cannot make bottom row because 7 is missing.\n\n   Decision: **take corner 2** \u2014 top-right.\n\n   Why?  \n   - Top row: 0 and 2 \u2192 both X \u2192 forces O to eventually block 1.  \n   - Later, I can play 6 or 3 to set up column or fork.\n\n   But wait \u2014 another option: **the best reply to center + opposite corner is actually to take a different corner**, and then force a draw at minimum. Either 2 or 6 is fine.\n\n   I'll pick 2 \u2014 top-right \u2014 to build top row.\n\n7.

Then 3 would win.\n\n   But consider symmetry:  \n   - O has 8 \u2014 bottom-right. If I take 6 (bottom-left), I have both bottom corners.  \n   - But that gives O the center and diagonal strength.\n\n   Better: Take 2.

If O plays 1 (to block top row), then I can play 6, threatening 0-3-6 (column) and maybe 6-7-8 (but 8 is O).  \n   - Better: I play 6 \u2192 X at 0 and 6 \u2192 threaten 3 to win column. O must respond.\n\n   But wait \u2014 better corner?\n\n   Alternative idea: **Take corner 6** instead?\n\n   - 0 and 6: both on left column \u2192 immediate two-in-column threat.  \n   - O will have to block 3 eventually if I pressure that.  \n   - Also, 6 opposes 2, avoids clustering at top.\n\n   But O has 8.

Future threats  \n   - By placing X in 0, I create potential along:\n     - Top row: 0-1-2\n     - Left column: 0-3-6\n     - Diagonal: 0-4-8 (though 4 is taken by O, so this diagonal is now defensive \u2014 I can aim for 0-4-8 only if I control 8 and block O's line)\n   - But more importantly, this sets up the possibility of creating a fork later, depending on opponent\u2019s response.\n\n   Example: If opponent responds in another corner, I can aim for opposite corner or edge to create dual threats.\n\nConclusion  \nTake corner 0 to maximize strategic influence and set up strong future opportunities.\n\n0]\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [Step-by-step reasoning]\n\n1.

Immediate winning checks  \n   - I don\u2019t yet have two in any line, so no win-table moves here.\n\n3. Block-against checks  \n   - Opponent has no two-in-a-row either; no forced blocks.\n\n4. Strategic priorities  \n   a) Corners are now especially important.  \n      \u2013 If I grab one corner, e.g. 2, it forms a diagonal threat (2-4-6) or (2-4-0), but 0 is already X.  \n   b) Most critical: grab the opposite corner (8), giving a double-corner position (0 vs 4-8).  \n      \u2013 This leaves X with no immediate fork threats and sets up a strong chance for X to need to block one of my future lines.\n\n5. Fork-creation potential  \n   - After placing at 8, my next move can aim to create two simultaneous threats along diagonals/rows that X cannot both block.\n\nConclusion  \nTake corner 8 (bottom-right) to secure the strong paired-corners alignment while denying X useful corner space.\n\n8\n[GAME] Player 0 attempted an invalid move.

Win check  \n   - Do I have two X's in any line? No \u2014 only one X so far. Cannot win on this move.\n\n3. Block check  \n   - Does O have two in a row?  \n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: O has 4 and 8, I have 0 \u2192 O has two, but cannot complete because 0 is mine.  \n     - Row 6-7-8: O has 8, but 6 and 7 are empty \u2192 one O only.  \n     - Column 2-5-8: O has 8, others empty \u2192 only one.  \n   - So O cannot win next move. No immediate block needed.\n\n4. Strategic priorities  \n   - Corners: 0 (taken by me), 2, 6, 8 (taken by O) \u2192 available: 2, 6  \n   - Edges: 1, 3, 5, 7  \n   - Best move: take a corner to maintain balance and create potential forks.\n\n5. Evaluating corner choices  \n   - Corner 2 (top-right):  \n     - Completes top row (0-1-2) with me holding 0 and 2 \u2192 strong potential for row threat.  \n     - Also part of diagonal 2-4-6 \u2192 but 4 is O, so this would be a defensive diagonal unless I control both 2 and 6.  \n   - Corner 6 (bottom-left):  \n     - Part of left column (0-3-6): I have 0, so 6 would give me two in column.  \n     - Also diagonal 0-4-8 (blocked), 2-4-6? \u2192 O has 4, so again, not ideal.  \n     - But if I take 6, I have 0 and 6 \u2014 both left column, setting up 3 to complete.\n\n6. Fork potential  \n   - If I take corner 2, I have 0 and 2 \u2014 both in top row. Then if I later take 1, I win.  \n   - O may respond to block.\n   - Alternatively, if I take 6, I have 0 and 6 \u2014 left column. Then 3 would win.\n\n   But consider symmetry:  \n   - O has 8 \u2014 bottom-right. If I take 6 (bottom-left), I have both bottom corners.  \n   - But that gives O the center and diagonal strength.\n\n   Better: Take 2. Why?  \n   - Top row: 0 (X) \u2013 1 \u2013 2 (X) \u2192 O will be forced to block 1 eventually.  \n   - Diagonal 2-4-6: O holds 4, but if I get both 2 and 6, I have pressure.  \n   - Also, 2 is opposite to 6, but O doesn\u2019t have 6 yet.\n\n   However, more critical: **create opportunity for a fork later**.\n\n   Let\u2019s simulate:\n   - I play 2 \u2192 board: X | ? | X  \n   - O must respond carefully. If O plays 1 (to block top row), then I can play 6, threatening 0-3-6 (column) and maybe 6-7-8 (but 8 is O).  \n   - Better: I play 6 \u2192 X at 0 and 6 \u2192 threaten 3 to win column. O must respond.\n\n   But wait \u2014 better corner?\n\n   Alternative idea: **Take corner 6** instead?\n\n   - 0 and 6: both on left column \u2192 immediate two-in-column threat.  \n   - O will have to block 3 eventually if I pressure that.  \n   - Also, 6 opposes 2, avoids clustering at top.\n\n   But O has 8. If I take 6, O might take 2 or center-side edges.\n\n   Actually, symmetry suggests: when O takes opposite corner (8), best response is to take a third corner \u2014 doesn\u2019t matter which, as long as it\u2019s not adjacent.\n\n   But standard theory:  \n   - After:\n     - O: center\n     - X: corner (0)\n     - O: opposite corner (8)\n   - Best for X is to take **another corner**, not adjacent to both \u2014 so 2 or 6 are both fine.\n\n   However, **taking 6 (bottom-left)** gives:\n   - Left column: 0 and 6 \u2192 two in column \u2192 forces O to block 3 if I threaten.\n   - Also avoids giving O easy diagonal.\n\n   But **taking 2 (top-right)** gives top row: 0 and 2 \u2192 two in row \u2192 threat on 1.\n\n   Both are symmetrically similar.\n\n   But note: O has 8 \u2014 bottom-right.  \n   If I take 6 (bottom-left), and O already has 8, then O controls two bottom corners? Not dangerous, but no immediate row.\n\n   However, O cannot make bottom row because 7 is missing.\n\n   Decision: **take corner 2** \u2014 top-right.\n\n   Why?  \n   - Top row: 0 and 2 \u2192 both X \u2192 forces O to eventually block 1.  \n   - Later, I can play 6 or 3 to set up column or fork.\n\n   But wait \u2014 another option: **the best reply to center + opposite corner is actually to take a different corner**, and then force a draw at minimum. Either 2 or 6 is fine.\n\n   I'll pick 2 \u2014 top-right \u2014 to build top row.\n\n7. Conclusion  \nTake corner 2 to establish a two-in-a-row threat across the top and increase fork potential later.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [Step-by-step reasoning]\n\n1.

Immediate winning checks for O  \n   - Diagonal 0-4-8: X has 0, O has 4 and 8 \u2192 not a winning line for O.  \n   - Row 6-7-8: O has 8, but 6 and 7 empty \u2192 one O.  \n   - Column 2-5-8: O has 8, but 2 and 5 empty \u2192 one O.  \n   So I cannot win on this move.\n\n3. Blocking checks for O  \n   - Do any lines threaten two X\u2019s with one empty cell?  \n     - Top row 0-1-2: X has 0 and 2 \u2192 exactly two with cell 1 open \u2192 immediate win risk for X if left unblocked.  \n   Therefore I **must** play at 1 (center-top) to block X from winning on the top row.\n\n4.

Creating a winning line  \n   - If I play 6, I will control three corners (not applicable) and two edges, but more importantly I will have:  \n     - Bottom row: 6-O-8 \u2192 two O\u2019s with 7 blocked by X.

Evaluating corner choices  \n   - Corner 2 (top-right):  \n     - Completes top row (0-1-2) with me holding 0 and 2 \u2192 strong potential for row threat.  \n     - Also part of diagonal 2-4-6 \u2192 but 4 is O, so this would be a defensive diagonal unless I control both 2 and 6.  \n   - Corner 6 (bottom-left):  \n     - Part of left column (0-3-6): I have 0, so 6 would give me two in column.  \n     - Also diagonal 0-4-8 (blocked), 2-4-6? \u2192 O has 4, so again, not ideal.  \n     - But if I take 6, I have 0 and 6 \u2014 both left column, setting up 3 to complete.\n\n6. Fork potential  \n   - If I take corner 2, I have 0 and 2 \u2014 both in top row. Then if I later take 1, I win.  \n   - O may respond to block.\n   - Alternatively, if I take 6, I have 0 and 6 \u2014 left column. Then 3 would win.\n\n   But consider symmetry:  \n   - O has 8 \u2014 bottom-right. If I take 6 (bottom-left), I have both bottom corners.  \n   - But that gives O the center and diagonal strength.\n\n   Better: Take 2. Why?  \n   - Top row: 0 (X) \u2013 1 \u2013 2 (X) \u2192 O will be forced to block 1 eventually.  \n   - Diagonal 2-4-6: O holds 4, but if I get both 2 and 6, I have pressure.  \n   - Also, 2 is opposite to 6, but O doesn\u2019t have 6 yet.\n\n   However, more critical: **create opportunity for a fork later**.\n\n   Let\u2019s simulate:\n   - I play 2 \u2192 board: X | ? | X  \n   - O must respond carefully. If O plays 1 (to block top row), then I can play 6, threatening 0-3-6 (column) and maybe 6-7-8 (but 8 is O).  \n   - Better: I play 6 \u2192 X at 0 and 6 \u2192 threaten 3 to win column. O must respond.\n\n   But wait \u2014 better corner?\n\n   Alternative idea: **Take corner 6** instead?\n\n   - 0 and 6: both on left column \u2192 immediate two-in-column threat.  \n   - O will have to block 3 eventually if I pressure that.  \n   - Also, 6 opposes 2, avoids clustering at top.\n\n   But O has 8. If I take 6, O might take 2 or center-side edges.\n\n   Actually, symmetry suggests: when O takes opposite corner (8), best response is to take a third corner \u2014 doesn\u2019t matter which, as long as it\u2019s not adjacent.\n\n   But standard theory:  \n   - After:\n     - O: center\n     - X: corner (0)\n     - O: opposite corner (8)\n   - Best for X is to take **another corner**, not adjacent to both \u2014 so 2 or 6 are both fine.\n\n   However, **taking 6 (bottom-left)** gives:\n   - Left column: 0 and 6 \u2192 two in column \u2192 forces O to block 3 if I threaten.\n   - Also avoids giving O easy diagonal.\n\n   But **taking 2 (top-right)** gives top row: 0 and 2 \u2192 two in row \u2192 threat on 1.\n\n   Both are symmetrically similar.\n\n   But note: O has 8 \u2014 bottom-right.  \n   If I take 6 (bottom-left), and O already has 8, then O controls two bottom corners? Not dangerous, but no immediate row.\n\n   However, O cannot make bottom row because 7 is missing.\n\n   Decision: **take corner 2** \u2014 top-right.\n\n   Why?  \n   - Top row: 0 and 2 \u2192 both X \u2192 forces O to eventually block 1.  \n   - Later, I can play 6 or 3 to set up column or fork.\n\n   But wait \u2014 another option: **the best reply to center + opposite corner is actually to take a different corner**, and then force a draw at minimum. Either 2 or 6 is fine.\n\n   I'll pick 2 \u2014 top-right \u2014 to build top row.\n\n7. Conclusion  \nTake corner 2 to establish a two-in-a-row threat across the top and increase fork potential later.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [Step-by-step reasoning]\n\n1.

Why?  \n   - Top row: 0 (X) \u2013 1 \u2013 2 (X) \u2192 O will be forced to block 1 eventually.  \n   - Diagonal 2-4-6: O holds 4, but if I get both 2 and 6, I have pressure.  \n   - Also, 2 is opposite to 6, but O doesn\u2019t have 6 yet.\n\n   However, more critical: **create opportunity for a fork later**.\n\n   Let\u2019s simulate:\n   - I play 2 \u2192 board: X | ? | X  \n   - O must respond carefully. If O plays 1 (to block top row), then I can play 6, threatening 0-3-6 (column) and maybe 6-7-8 (but 8 is O).  \n   - Better: I play 6 \u2192 X at 0 and 6 \u2192 threaten 3 to win column. O must respond.\n\n   But wait \u2014 better corner?\n\n   Alternative idea: **Take corner 6** instead?\n\n   - 0 and 6: both on left column \u2192 immediate two-in-column threat.  \n   - O will have to block 3 eventually if I pressure that.  \n   - Also, 6 opposes 2, avoids clustering at top.\n\n   But O has 8. If I take 6, O might take 2 or center-side edges.\n\n   Actually, symmetry suggests: when O takes opposite corner (8), best response is to take a third corner \u2014 doesn\u2019t matter which, as long as it\u2019s not adjacent.\n\n   But standard theory:  \n   - After:\n     - O: center\n     - X: corner (0)\n     - O: opposite corner (8)\n   - Best for X is to take **another corner**, not adjacent to both \u2014 so 2 or 6 are both fine.\n\n   However, **taking 6 (bottom-left)** gives:\n   - Left column: 0 and 6 \u2192 two in column \u2192 forces O to block 3 if I threaten.\n   - Also avoids giving O easy diagonal.\n\n   But **taking 2 (top-right)** gives top row: 0 and 2 \u2192 two in row \u2192 threat on 1.\n\n   Both are symmetrically similar.\n\n   But note: O has 8 \u2014 bottom-right.  \n   If I take 6 (bottom-left), and O already has 8, then O controls two bottom corners? Not dangerous, but no immediate row.\n\n   However, O cannot make bottom row because 7 is missing.\n\n   Decision: **take corner 2** \u2014 top-right.\n\n   Why?  \n   - Top row: 0 and 2 \u2192 both X \u2192 forces O to eventually block 1.  \n   - Later, I can play 6 or 3 to set up column or fork.\n\n   But wait \u2014 another option: **the best reply to center + opposite corner is actually to take a different corner**, and then force a draw at minimum. Either 2 or 6 is fine.\n\n   I'll pick 2 \u2014 top-right \u2014 to build top row.\n\n7. Conclusion  \nTake corner 2 to establish a two-in-a-row threat across the top and increase fork potential later.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [Step-by-step reasoning]\n\n1.

Immediate winning checks for O  \n   - Diagonal 0-4-8: X has 0, O has 4 and 8 \u2192 not a winning line for O.  \n   - Row 6-7-8: O has 8, but 6 and 7 empty \u2192 one O.  \n   - Column 2-5-8: O has 8, but 2 and 5 empty \u2192 one O.  \n   So I cannot win on this move.\n\n3. Blocking checks for O  \n   - Do any lines threaten two X\u2019s with one empty cell?  \n     - Top row 0-1-2: X has 0 and 2 \u2192 exactly two with cell 1 open \u2192 immediate win risk for X if left unblocked.  \n   Therefore I **must** play at 1 (center-top) to block X from winning on the top row.\n\n4. Once I block the top row, what else happens?  \n   - After I place O at 1, O has:  \n     - Center (4)  \n     - Bottom-right (8)  \n     - Center-top (1)  \n   - X still has top corners 0 and 2.  \n   - Board then looks symmetric.

Strategic value of move 7  \n   - Cell 7 is an edge piece, but in this case, it's the **only** move that prevents an immediate loss.  \n   - Playing 7 stops O from completing column 1-4-7.\n\n5. Alternative moves analysis  \n   - 3: Part of left column, could build 0-3-6, but O could then win at 7 before I complete.  \n   - 5: Right column, no immediate threat.  \n   - 6: Could help left column, but again, O wins next move at 7.  \n   None of these prevent O\u2019s win \u2014 only 7 does.\n\nConclusion  \nPlay 7 to block O\u2019s immediate winning threat in the middle column.\n\n[7]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]'\n[Player 0] [Step-by-step reasoning]\n\n1.

Strategic value of remaining cells  \n   - Cell 3: edge, part of left column (0-3-6).  \n   - Cell 5: edge, part of right column (2-5-8).  \n   - Cell 6: corner, part of bottom row (6-7-8) and diagonal (2-4-6) and left column (0-3-6).  \n   - Corners are higher value than edges; cell 6 is the only corner left.\n\n5. Creating a winning line  \n   - If I play 6, I will control three corners (not applicable) and two edges, but more importantly I will have:  \n     - Bottom row: 6-O-8 \u2192 two O\u2019s with 7 blocked by X. Not a win.  \n     - Diagonal 2-4-6: 2 is X, 4 is O, 6 would be O \u2192 still not a win.  \n     - Left column: 0-X, 3 empty, 6-O \u2192 one O.  \n   - However, 6 is the only remaining corner, and it improves my board presence; edges 3 and 5 only participate in two lines each.\n\n6. Game outcome projection  \n   - After I play 6, empty cells will be 3 and 5.  \n   - X will then have to choose between 3 and 5; at most the game ends in a draw.  \n   - Playing an edge instead of 6 would leave X the corner 6, which could give X more future leverage.  \n   - Therefore, taking 6 is the strongest available move.\n\nConclusion  \nPlay 6 to secure the final corner and maximize my positional strength while limiting X\u2019s options.\n\n[6]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]'\n[Player 1] [Step-by-step reasoning]\n\n1.
