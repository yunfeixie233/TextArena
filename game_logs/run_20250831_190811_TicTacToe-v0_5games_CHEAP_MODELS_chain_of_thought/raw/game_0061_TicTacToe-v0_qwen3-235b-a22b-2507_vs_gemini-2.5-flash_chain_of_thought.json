      "response": "I need to analyze the current state of the board after my opponent's move.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Current Board State:**\n   - Position 0: X (Player 1)\n   - Position 4: O (Player 0 - me)\n   - All other positions are empty.\n\n   Board:\n   ```\n   X | 1 | 2 \n   ---+---+---\n   3 | O | 5 \n   ---+---+---\n   6 | 7 | 8 \n   ```\n\n2. **Immediate Winning Moves Available?**\n   - No. I have only two moves: O at 4, and X at 0. I need two in a row to have a potential win on next move.\n\n3. **Opponent Winning Moves to Block?**\n   - Currently, Player 1 (X) has only one mark at position 0. No immediate threat of three-in-a-row.\n\n4. **Strategic Positions to Prioritize:**\n   - I already control the center (4), which is excellent.\n   - Player 1 has taken a corner (0), which is also strong.\n   - The remaining corners are 2 (top-right), 6 (bottom-left), and 8 (bottom-right).\n   - The diagonals:\n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-? \u2192 This line has both X and O, so it cannot be completed by either player \u2014 effectively dead.\n     - Diagonal 2-4-6: ?-O-? \u2192 I can build on this diagonal if I take either 2 or 6.\n\n   If I take **corner 8** (bottom-right), the diagonal 0-4-8 becomes X-O-X, which benefits my opponent by completing their line? No \u2014 wait:\n   - If I place O at 8 \u2192 0-4-8 would be X-O-O \u2192 not a threat for X.\n   - But **only X can win on that diagonal**, and they would need another X at 8, but I can prevent that by taking 8.\n\n   However, if I take **corner 2 or 6**, I can start building on the other diagonal (2-4-6) with my O in center.\n\n   Also, consider forks:\n   - If I take a corner, I increase my chance of creating a fork (two winning threats at once) later.\n   - Corners 2, 6, 8 are all viable, but let's evaluate specific threats.\n\n5. **Looking Ahead - Creating Two-in-a-Row:**\n   - My O is at 4.\n   - If I place O at **8**, then:\n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-O \u2192 can't win, but blocks X from completing diagonal.\n     - No two-in-a-row for me yet.\n   - If I place O at **2**:\n     - Top row: X | O | ? \u2192 not strong.\n     - Diagonal 2-4-6: O-O-? \u2192 I have two in a row! Then next move I could win by playing 6, unless blocked.\n     - Column 2: 2,5,8: one O so far.\n\n   Wait \u2014 if I play at **2**:\n   - Diagonal 2-4-6 becomes O-O-?, which is a direct threat: if I get to play 6 later, I win (unless blocked).\n   - Also, I own two corners: 2 and 4 (center), building strong board control.\n\n   Alternatively, if I play at **6**:\n   - Diagonal 2-4-6: ?-O-O \u2192 same thing, but then 2 is empty. Same threat.\n   - Column 6: 0,3,6 \u2192 currently X at 0.\n\n   But note: 0 is X, so if I play in 6, column 0-3-6 becomes X-?-O \u2192 not a threat for me.\n\n   However, **playing in 2 gives:**\n   - Diagonal: 2-4-6 \u2192 O-O-? \u2192 potential win at 6\n   - Top row: 0-1-2 \u2192 X-?-O \u2192 if I get 1, I could threaten, but X already has 0 so not a strong row.\n\n   But here\u2019s a better idea: **take 8**?\n\n   Let me evaluate:\n   - If I play 8, then:\n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-O \u2192 blocks X from winning there.\n     - I control center and corner.\n     - But no two-in-a-row threat.\n\n   Whereas:\n   - If I play **2**, then:\n     - Diagonal: 2-4-6 \u2192 O-O-? \u2192 immediate threat to win at 6.\n   - Then if Player 1 doesn't block 6, I win.\n\n   But wait: Player 1 might not let that happen.\n\n   Is there a better way?\n\n   Alternatively, **take 6**? Same diagonal potential.\n\n   The diagonal 2-4-6 is symmetric. Playing 2 or 6 both create a two-O threat along that diagonal.\n\n   But consider **Player 1's potential plans**:\n   - They have X at 0.\n   - They might want to take 8 next to create a corner pair (0 and 8) and threaten row 0-1-2 or diagonal 0-4-8.\n\n   If I do *not* take 8, Player 1 might take it next, giving them two corners and a strong position.\n\n   However, **my highest priority should be to create a direct winning threat**.\n\n   So:\n   - Playing **2** \u2192 O at 2 and 4, threaten 6 \u2192 win on diagonal.\n   - Playing **6** \u2192 same thing, threaten 2.\n\n   So both 2 and 6 are symmetric in that sense.\n\n   But let\u2019s score:\n   - **Position 2 (top-right corner)**: corner, part of:\n     - Top row (0-1-2)\n     - Right column (2-5-8)\n     - Diagonal (2-4-6) \u2192 I already have 4 \u2192 so I get two-in-a-row threat.\n\n   - **Position 8 (bottom-right)**: corner, part of:\n     - Bottom row (6-7-8)\n     - Right column (2-5-8)\n     - Diagonal (0-4-8) \u2192 already has X and O \u2192 dead, cannot be won by either.\n\n   So diagonal 0-4-8 is **blocked** \u2014 neither player can win there.\n\n   Therefore, **position 8** is less valuable for me because one of its three lines is dead.\n\n   Similarly, position 2: all three lines are still live.\n\n   So **position 2 is better**.\n\n   Position 6: corner, lines:\n     - Left column (0-3-6) \u2192 has X at 0\n     - Bottom row (6-7-8)\n     - Diagonal (2-4-6) \u2192 live, with O at 4\n\n   So both 2 and 6 are good.\n\n   But let's see: if I play **2**:\n   - I create O at 2 and 4 \u2192 threat at 6\n   - Then Player 1 must block by playing 6\n   - Then I can take another corner, maybe 8, and build another threat.\n\n   If I play **6**:\n   - O at 6 and 4 \u2192 threat at 2\n   - Player 1 blocks 2\n   - Then I take 8 or something.\n\n   Same outcome \u2014 symmetric.\n\n   But here's a key point: **position 2 (top-right)** is part of the **right column (2-5-8)** and **top row**.\n\n   However, **top row has X at 0**, so if I play 2, top row is X-?-O \u2192 Player 1 could later take 1 and threaten, but I can block.\n\n   Similarly, if I play 6, left column is X-?-O.\n\n   So both are symmetric.\n\n   But to break symmetry, I should choose a corner that is not adjacent to opponent's corner? Corners are adjacent diagonally.\n\n   Actually, 0 and 2 are adjacent via row, 0 and 6 via column.\n\n   But 0 and 8 are diagonal.\n\n   Wait \u2014 **0 and 2** share a side (top row)\n   **0 and 6** share a column (left column)\n\n   But 0 and 8 are opposite.\n\n   But that doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\n   Best idea: **create an immediate two-in-a-row threat**.\n\n   So I should play either 2 or 6 to create a diagonal threat.\n\n   Let's pick one \u2014 say **2**.\n\n   Move: [2]\n\n   After I play 2:\n   - Board: X | ? | O\n           ? | O | ?\n           ? | ? | ?\n   - Diagonal 2-4-6: O-O-? \u2192 I threaten to win at 6.\n\n   Then Player 1 must respond by blocking at 6.\n\n   That gives me initiative.\n\n   Alternatively, I could play **8** to take a corner and prevent X from having both 0 and 8, but since the diagonal 0-4-8 is dead, it's not crucial.\n\n   And the reward of threatening a win is higher than taking an inactive corner.\n\n   Therefore, best move is to **create a two-O diagonal on 2-4-6**.\n\n   I'll play at **position 2**.\n\n[2]",

This means they control the most potential winning lines.\n    *   As Player 1 ('X'), my primary goal for the first move is to secure a strong position that offers many potential winning lines and preferably corners.\n    *   The best responses to an opponent taking the center are generally the corners, as they deny the opponent control of adjacent lines and still offer three potential winning lines for myself.\n    *   Placing an 'X' in a corner creates a fork opportunity later on, or at least allows me to create a line with the center O, forcing O to block on the next move.\n\n5.  **Setting up Multiple Winning Threats/Opponent Planning:**\n    *   By placing 'X' in a corner, I immediately create three potential lines (row, column, diagonal) that could eventually lead to a win.\n    *   For example, if I choose position 0:\n        *   Row: 0, 1, 2\n        *   Column: 0, 3, 6\n        *   Diagonal: 0, 4, 8 (This line is partially formed with O in 4)\n    *   This forces my opponent to consider blocking my lines or continuing to build their own. Taking a corner (e.g., 0, 2, 6, or 8) is the standard and strongest response to a center opening.\n\nI will choose the top-left corner (position 0) as my first move. This is a common and strong opening move in response to a center play.\n\n[0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] I need to analyze the current state of the board after my opponent's move.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Current Board State:**\n   - Position 0: X (Player 1)\n   - Position 4: O (Player 0 - me)\n   - All other positions are empty.\n\n   Board:\n   ```\n   X | 1 | 2 \n   ---+---+---\n   3 | O | 5 \n   ---+---+---\n   6 | 7 | 8 \n   ```\n\n2. **Immediate Winning Moves Available?**\n   - No. I have only two moves: O at 4, and X at 0. I need two in a row to have a potential win on next move.\n\n3. **Opponent Winning Moves to Block?**\n   - Currently, Player 1 (X) has only one mark at position 0. No immediate threat of three-in-a-row.\n\n4. **Strategic Positions to Prioritize:**\n   - I already control the center (4), which is excellent.\n   - Player 1 has taken a corner (0), which is also strong.\n   - The remaining corners are 2 (top-right), 6 (bottom-left), and 8 (bottom-right).\n   - The diagonals:\n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-? \u2192 This line has both X and O, so it cannot be completed by either player \u2014 effectively dead.\n     - Diagonal 2-4-6: ?-O-? \u2192 I can build on this diagonal if I take either 2 or 6.\n\n   If I take **corner 8** (bottom-right), the diagonal 0-4-8 becomes X-O-X, which benefits my opponent by completing their line? No \u2014 wait:\n   - If I place O at 8 \u2192 0-4-8 would be X-O-O \u2192 not a threat for X.\n   - But **only X can win on that diagonal**, and they would need another X at 8, but I can prevent that by taking 8.\n\n   However, if I take **corner 2 or 6**, I can start building on the other diagonal (2-4-6) with my O in center.\n\n   Also, consider forks:\n   - If I take a corner, I increase my chance of creating a fork (two winning threats at once) later.\n   - Corners 2, 6, 8 are all viable, but let's evaluate specific threats.\n\n5. **Looking Ahead - Creating Two-in-a-Row:**\n   - My O is at 4.\n   - If I place O at **8**, then:\n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-O \u2192 can't win, but blocks X from completing diagonal.\n     - No two-in-a-row for me yet.\n   - If I place O at **2**:\n     - Top row: X | O | ? \u2192 not strong.\n     - Diagonal 2-4-6: O-O-? \u2192 I have two in a row! Then next move I could win by playing 6, unless blocked.\n     - Column 2: 2,5,8: one O so far.\n\n   Wait \u2014 if I play at **2**:\n   - Diagonal 2-4-6 becomes O-O-?, which is a direct threat: if I get to play 6 later, I win (unless blocked).\n   - Also, I own two corners: 2 and 4 (center), building strong board control.\n\n   Alternatively, if I play at **6**:\n   - Diagonal 2-4-6: ?-O-O \u2192 same thing, but then 2 is empty. Same threat.\n   - Column 6: 0,3,6 \u2192 currently X at 0.\n\n   But note: 0 is X, so if I play in 6, column 0-3-6 becomes X-?-O \u2192 not a threat for me.\n\n   However, **playing in 2 gives:**\n   - Diagonal: 2-4-6 \u2192 O-O-? \u2192 potential win at 6\n   - Top row: 0-1-2 \u2192 X-?-O \u2192 if I get 1, I could threaten, but X already has 0 so not a strong row.\n\n   But here\u2019s a better idea: **take 8**?\n\n   Let me evaluate:\n   - If I play 8, then:\n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-O \u2192 blocks X from winning there.\n     - I control center and corner.\n     - But no two-in-a-row threat.\n\n   Whereas:\n   - If I play **2**, then:\n     - Diagonal: 2-4-6 \u2192 O-O-? \u2192 immediate threat to win at 6.\n   - Then if Player 1 doesn't block 6, I win.\n\n   But wait: Player 1 might not let that happen.\n\n   Is there a better way?\n\n   Alternatively, **take 6**? Same diagonal potential.\n\n   The diagonal 2-4-6 is symmetric. Playing 2 or 6 both create a two-O threat along that diagonal.\n\n   But consider **Player 1's potential plans**:\n   - They have X at 0.\n   - They might want to take 8 next to create a corner pair (0 and 8) and threaten row 0-1-2 or diagonal 0-4-8.\n\n   If I do *not* take 8, Player 1 might take it next, giving them two corners and a strong position.\n\n   However, **my highest priority should be to create a direct winning threat**.\n\n   So:\n   - Playing **2** \u2192 O at 2 and 4, threaten 6 \u2192 win on diagonal.\n   - Playing **6** \u2192 same thing, threaten 2.\n\n   So both 2 and 6 are symmetric in that sense.\n\n   But let\u2019s score:\n   - **Position 2 (top-right corner)**: corner, part of:\n     - Top row (0-1-2)\n     - Right column (2-5-8)\n     - Diagonal (2-4-6) \u2192 I already have 4 \u2192 so I get two-in-a-row threat.\n\n   - **Position 8 (bottom-right)**: corner, part of:\n     - Bottom row (6-7-8)\n     - Right column (2-5-8)\n     - Diagonal (0-4-8) \u2192 already has X and O \u2192 dead, cannot be won by either.\n\n   So diagonal 0-4-8 is **blocked** \u2014 neither player can win there.\n\n   Therefore, **position 8** is less valuable for me because one of its three lines is dead.\n\n   Similarly, position 2: all three lines are still live.\n\n   So **position 2 is better**.\n\n   Position 6: corner, lines:\n     - Left column (0-3-6) \u2192 has X at 0\n     - Bottom row (6-7-8)\n     - Diagonal (2-4-6) \u2192 live, with O at 4\n\n   So both 2 and 6 are good.\n\n   But let's see: if I play **2**:\n   - I create O at 2 and 4 \u2192 threat at 6\n   - Then Player 1 must block by playing 6\n   - Then I can take another corner, maybe 8, and build another threat.\n\n   If I play **6**:\n   - O at 6 and 4 \u2192 threat at 2\n   - Player 1 blocks 2\n   - Then I take 8 or something.\n\n   Same outcome \u2014 symmetric.\n\n   But here's a key point: **position 2 (top-right)** is part of the **right column (2-5-8)** and **top row**.\n\n   However, **top row has X at 0**, so if I play 2, top row is X-?-O \u2192 Player 1 could later take 1 and threaten, but I can block.\n\n   Similarly, if I play 6, left column is X-?-O.\n\n   So both are symmetric.\n\n   But to break symmetry, I should choose a corner that is not adjacent to opponent's corner? Corners are adjacent diagonally.\n\n   Actually, 0 and 2 are adjacent via row, 0 and 6 via column.\n\n   But 0 and 8 are diagonal.\n\n   Wait \u2014 **0 and 2** share a side (top row)\n   **0 and 6** share a column (left column)\n\n   But 0 and 8 are opposite.\n\n   But that doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\n   Best idea: **create an immediate two-in-a-row threat**.\n\n   So I should play either 2 or 6 to create a diagonal threat.\n\n   Let's pick one \u2014 say **2**.\n\n   Move: [2]\n\n   After I play 2:\n   - Board: X | ? | O\n           ? | O | ?\n           ? | ? | ?\n   - Diagonal 2-4-6: O-O-? \u2192 I threaten to win at 6.\n\n   Then Player 1 must respond by blocking at 6.\n\n   That gives me initiative.\n\n   Alternatively, I could play **8** to take a corner and prevent X from having both 0 and 8, but since the diagonal 0-4-8 is dead, it's not crucial.\n\n   And the reward of threatening a win is higher than taking an inactive corner.\n\n   Therefore, best move is to **create a two-O diagonal on 2-4-6**.\n\n   I'll play at **position 2**.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'",

If Player 1 occupies position 3 next turn, they win via left column.  \n   - No other immediate winning threats exist for either player.\n\n2. **Opponent's Winning Moves to Block (Priority #1):**  \n   - Player 1 has **two X's in the left column (0 and 6)** with the center (position 3) empty. This is an **immediate winning threat**.  \n   - If I do not block position 3 now, Player 1 will play there on their next turn and win.  \n   - **Blocking position 3 is non-negotiable**\u2014failure to do so loses the game immediately.\n\n3. **My Winning Moves?**  \n   - I have two O's (positions 2 and 4), but no two-in-a-row can be completed in one move:  \n     - Diagonal 2-4-6 is blocked by X at 6 (O-O-X).  \n     - Right column (2-5-8) has only one O (at 2).  \n     - Middle row (3-4-5) has only one O (at 4).  \n   - No immediate win exists for me this turn.\n\n4. **Strategic Positioning:**  \n   - Position 3 (left edge) has low inherent value (edges are weaker than corners), but **blocking justifies its play here**.  \n   - After blocking at 3:  \n     - The left column becomes X-O-X (blocked).  \n     - I gain a secondary threat: Middle row (3-4-5) now has O-O-? (positions 3 and 4), threatening a win at position 5.  \n     - Player 1 will be forced to block my middle-row threat next turn, buying me time.  \n\n5. **Why Not Other Moves?**  \n   - Playing elsewhere (e.g., corner 8) would allow Player 1 to immediately win via position 3.  \n   - *Example*: If I play [8], they play [3] and win left column. This is game over.  \n   - Only [3] prevents an instant loss.\n\n**Conclusion**: Blocking position 3 is the only move that avoids immediate defeat. It also creates a counter-threat in the middle row, forcing Player 1 into defensive play on their next turn.\n\n[3]",

Since no moves have been made yet by either player, the board is completely empty.\n\nThis is the very first move of the game.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The board is empty \u2013 no 'X' or 'O' has been placed.\n2. There are no immediate winning moves (since at least three moves are needed to win).\n3. There are no threats from the opponent to block.\n4. Strategic positions in Tic Tac Toe:\n   - The **center (position 4)** is the most valuable square because it is part of four possible winning lines: middle row, middle column, and both diagonals.\n   - The **corners (positions 0, 2, 6, 8)** are next in value, each part of three winning lines.\n   - The **edges (positions 1, 3, 5, 7)** are least valuable, each part of only two winning lines.\n\nAs Player 0 (O), I want to maximize my chances of creating multiple threats and force my opponent into defensive moves.\n\nTaking the center (position 4) gives me the most flexibility and control over the board. It is the best first move for the second player? Wait \u2014 actually, I am Player 0, which often means I go first. In standard Tic Tac Toe, Player 0 (O) usually moves first.\n\nSince the board is empty and no one has moved, I am making the **first move of the game**.\n\nTherefore, the best strategic move is to take the **center** to maximize control and future opportunities.\n\nThus, my move is:\n\n[4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1]  Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n I need to analyze the current state of the board.\nMy opponent (O) has placed their symbol in the center (position 4).\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Current Board State:**\n    *   Position 4: O\n    *   All other positions are empty.\n\n2.  **Immediate Winning Moves Available?**\n    *   No, as only one symbol (O) is on the board, and I have not placed any 'X' yet. A win requires three in a row.\n\n3.  **Opponent Winning Moves to Block?**\n    *   No, my opponent has only made one move. There are no immediate threats to block.\n\n4.  **Strategic Positions to Prioritize:**\n    *   My opponent has taken the best strategic position (center). This means they control the most potential winning lines.\n    *   As Player 1 ('X'), my primary goal for the first move is to secure a strong position that offers many potential winning lines and preferably corners.\n    *   The best responses to an opponent taking the center are generally the corners, as they deny the opponent control of adjacent lines and still offer three potential winning lines for myself.\n    *   Placing an 'X' in a corner creates a fork opportunity later on, or at least allows me to create a line with the center O, forcing O to block on the next move.\n\n5.  **Setting up Multiple Winning Threats/Opponent Planning:**\n    *   By placing 'X' in a corner, I immediately create three potential lines (row, column, diagonal) that could eventually lead to a win.\n    *   For example, if I choose position 0:\n        *   Row: 0, 1, 2\n        *   Column: 0, 3, 6\n        *   Diagonal: 0, 4, 8 (This line is partially formed with O in 4)\n    *   This forces my opponent to consider blocking my lines or continuing to build their own. Taking a corner (e.g., 0, 2, 6, or 8) is the standard and strongest response to a center opening.\n\nI will choose the top-left corner (position 0) as my first move.

No immediate threat of three-in-a-row.\n\n4. **Strategic Positions to Prioritize:**\n   - I already control the center (4), which is excellent.\n   - Player 1 has taken a corner (0), which is also strong.\n   - The remaining corners are 2 (top-right), 6 (bottom-left), and 8 (bottom-right).\n   - The diagonals:\n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-? \u2192 This line has both X and O, so it cannot be completed by either player \u2014 effectively dead.\n     - Diagonal 2-4-6: ?-O-? \u2192 I can build on this diagonal if I take either 2 or 6.\n\n   If I take **corner 8** (bottom-right), the diagonal 0-4-8 becomes X-O-X, which benefits my opponent by completing their line? No \u2014 wait:\n   - If I place O at 8 \u2192 0-4-8 would be X-O-O \u2192 not a threat for X.\n   - But **only X can win on that diagonal**, and they would need another X at 8, but I can prevent that by taking 8.\n\n   However, if I take **corner 2 or 6**, I can start building on the other diagonal (2-4-6) with my O in center.\n\n   Also, consider forks:\n   - If I take a corner, I increase my chance of creating a fork (two winning threats at once) later.\n   - Corners 2, 6, 8 are all viable, but let's evaluate specific threats.\n\n5. **Looking Ahead - Creating Two-in-a-Row:**\n   - My O is at 4.\n   - If I place O at **8**, then:\n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-O \u2192 can't win, but blocks X from completing diagonal.\n     - No two-in-a-row for me yet.\n   - If I place O at **2**:\n     - Top row: X | O | ? \u2192 not strong.\n     - Diagonal 2-4-6: O-O-? \u2192 I have two in a row! Then next move I could win by playing 6, unless blocked.\n     - Column 2: 2,5,8: one O so far.\n\n   Wait \u2014 if I play at **2**:\n   - Diagonal 2-4-6 becomes O-O-?, which is a direct threat: if I get to play 6 later, I win (unless blocked).\n   - Also, I own two corners: 2 and 4 (center), building strong board control.\n\n   Alternatively, if I play at **6**:\n   - Diagonal 2-4-6: ?-O-O \u2192 same thing, but then 2 is empty. Same threat.\n   - Column 6: 0,3,6 \u2192 currently X at 0.\n\n   But note: 0 is X, so if I play in 6, column 0-3-6 becomes X-?-O \u2192 not a threat for me.\n\n   However, **playing in 2 gives:**\n   - Diagonal: 2-4-6 \u2192 O-O-? \u2192 potential win at 6\n   - Top row: 0-1-2 \u2192 X-?-O \u2192 if I get 1, I could threaten, but X already has 0 so not a strong row.\n\n   But here\u2019s a better idea: **take 8**?\n\n   Let me evaluate:\n   - If I play 8, then:\n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-O \u2192 blocks X from winning there.\n     - I control center and corner.\n     - But no two-in-a-row threat.\n\n   Whereas:\n   - If I play **2**, then:\n     - Diagonal: 2-4-6 \u2192 O-O-? \u2192 immediate threat to win at 6.\n   - Then if Player 1 doesn't block 6, I win.\n\n   But wait: Player 1 might not let that happen.\n\n   Is there a better way?\n\n   Alternatively, **take 6**? Same diagonal potential.\n\n   The diagonal 2-4-6 is symmetric. Playing 2 or 6 both create a two-O threat along that diagonal.\n\n   But consider **Player 1's potential plans**:\n   - They have X at 0.\n   - They might want to take 8 next to create a corner pair (0 and 8) and threaten row 0-1-2 or diagonal 0-4-8.\n\n   If I do *not* take 8, Player 1 might take it next, giving them two corners and a strong position.\n\n   However, **my highest priority should be to create a direct winning threat**.\n\n   So:\n   - Playing **2** \u2192 O at 2 and 4, threaten 6 \u2192 win on diagonal.\n   - Playing **6** \u2192 same thing, threaten 2.\n\n   So both 2 and 6 are symmetric in that sense.\n\n   But let\u2019s score:\n   - **Position 2 (top-right corner)**: corner, part of:\n     - Top row (0-1-2)\n     - Right column (2-5-8)\n     - Diagonal (2-4-6) \u2192 I already have 4 \u2192 so I get two-in-a-row threat.\n\n   - **Position 8 (bottom-right)**: corner, part of:\n     - Bottom row (6-7-8)\n     - Right column (2-5-8)\n     - Diagonal (0-4-8) \u2192 already has X and O \u2192 dead, cannot be won by either.\n\n   So diagonal 0-4-8 is **blocked** \u2014 neither player can win there.\n\n   Therefore, **position 8** is less valuable for me because one of its three lines is dead.\n\n   Similarly, position 2: all three lines are still live.\n\n   So **position 2 is better**.\n\n   Position 6: corner, lines:\n     - Left column (0-3-6) \u2192 has X at 0\n     - Bottom row (6-7-8)\n     - Diagonal (2-4-6) \u2192 live, with O at 4\n\n   So both 2 and 6 are good.\n\n   But let's see: if I play **2**:\n   - I create O at 2 and 4 \u2192 threat at 6\n   - Then Player 1 must block by playing 6\n   - Then I can take another corner, maybe 8, and build another threat.\n\n   If I play **6**:\n   - O at 6 and 4 \u2192 threat at 2\n   - Player 1 blocks 2\n   - Then I take 8 or something.\n\n   Same outcome \u2014 symmetric.\n\n   But here's a key point: **position 2 (top-right)** is part of the **right column (2-5-8)** and **top row**.\n\n   However, **top row has X at 0**, so if I play 2, top row is X-?-O \u2192 Player 1 could later take 1 and threaten, but I can block.\n\n   Similarly, if I play 6, left column is X-?-O.\n\n   So both are symmetric.\n\n   But to break symmetry, I should choose a corner that is not adjacent to opponent's corner? Corners are adjacent diagonally.\n\n   Actually, 0 and 2 are adjacent via row, 0 and 6 via column.\n\n   But 0 and 8 are diagonal.\n\n   Wait \u2014 **0 and 2** share a side (top row)\n   **0 and 6** share a column (left column)\n\n   But 0 and 8 are opposite.\n\n   But that doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\n   Best idea: **create an immediate two-in-a-row threat**.\n\n   So I should play either 2 or 6 to create a diagonal threat.\n\n   Let's pick one \u2014 say **2**.\n\n   Move: [2]\n\n   After I play 2:\n   - Board: X | ? | O\n           ? | O | ?\n           ? | ? | ?\n   - Diagonal 2-4-6: O-O-? \u2192 I threaten to win at 6.\n\n   Then Player 1 must respond by blocking at 6.\n\n   That gives me initiative.\n\n   Alternatively, I could play **8** to take a corner and prevent X from having both 0 and 8, but since the diagonal 0-4-8 is dead, it's not crucial.\n\n   And the reward of threatening a win is higher than taking an inactive corner.\n\n   Therefore, best move is to **create a two-O diagonal on 2-4-6**.\n\n   I'll play at **position 2**.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1]  I need to analyze the current state of the board after my opponent's move.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Current Board State:**\n    *   Position 0: X (My symbol)\n    *   Position 2: O (Opponent's symbol)\n    *   Position 4: O (Opponent's symbol)\n    *   All other positions are empty.\n\n    Board:\n    ```\n     X | 1 | O \n    ---+---+---\n     3 | O | 5 \n    ---+---+---\n     6 | 7 | 8 \n    ```\n\n2.  **Immediate Winning Moves Available?**\n    *   No. I have only one 'X' on the board.\n\n3.  **Opponent Winning Moves to Block?**\n    *   Yes, this is critical.

I must block the opponent's win.\n\n[6]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0]  I need to analyze the current board state after Player 1's move.\n\nCurrent Board:\n```\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | 8 \n```\nAvailable Moves: [1], [3], [5], [7], [8]\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Current Board State:**  \n   - Player 1 (X) controls positions 0 and 6.  \n   - I (Player 0, O) control positions 2 and 4.  \n   - Critical observation: Positions 0 and 6 (both X) and position 3 (empty) form the left column (0-3-6). If Player 1 occupies position 3 next turn, they win via left column.  \n   - No other immediate winning threats exist for either player.\n\n2. **Opponent's Winning Moves to Block (Priority #1):**  \n   - Player 1 has **two X's in the left column (0 and 6)** with the center (position 3) empty. This is an **immediate winning threat**.  \n   - If I do not block position 3 now, Player 1 will play there on their next turn and win.  \n   - **Blocking position 3 is non-negotiable**\u2014failure to do so loses the game immediately.\n\n3. **My Winning Moves?**  \n   - I have two O's (positions 2 and 4), but no two-in-a-row can be completed in one move:  \n     - Diagonal 2-4-6 is blocked by X at 6 (O-O-X).  \n     - Right column (2-5-8) has only one O (at 2).  \n     - Middle row (3-4-5) has only one O (at 4).  \n   - No immediate win exists for me this turn.\n\n4. **Strategic Positioning:**  \n   - Position 3 (left edge) has low inherent value (edges are weaker than corners), but **blocking justifies its play here**.  \n   - After blocking at 3:  \n     - The left column becomes X-O-X (blocked).  \n     - I gain a secondary threat: Middle row (3-4-5) now has O-O-? (positions 3 and 4), threatening a win at position 5.  \n     - Player 1 will be forced to block my middle-row threat next turn, buying me time.  \n\n5. **Why Not Other Moves?**  \n   - Playing elsewhere (e.g., corner 8) would allow Player 1 to immediately win via position 3.  \n   - *Example*: If I play [8], they play [3] and win left column. This is game over.  \n   - Only [3] prevents an instant loss.\n\n**Conclusion**: Blocking position 3 is the only move that avoids immediate defeat. It also creates a counter-threat in the middle row, forcing Player 1 into defensive play on their next turn.\n\n[3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[7]', '[8]'",

Since no moves have been made yet by either player, the board is completely empty.\n\nThis is the very first move of the game.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The board is empty \u2013 no 'X' or 'O' has been placed.\n2. There are no immediate winning moves (since at least three moves are needed to win).\n3. There are no threats from the opponent to block.\n4. Strategic positions in Tic Tac Toe:\n   - The **center (position 4)** is the most valuable square because it is part of four possible winning lines: middle row, middle column, and both diagonals.\n   - The **corners (positions 0, 2, 6, 8)** are next in value, each part of three winning lines.\n   - The **edges (positions 1, 3, 5, 7)** are least valuable, each part of only two winning lines.\n\nAs Player 0 (O), I want to maximize my chances of creating multiple threats and force my opponent into defensive moves.\n\nTaking the center (position 4) gives me the most flexibility and control over the board. It is the best first move for the second player? Wait \u2014 actually, I am Player 0, which often means I go first. In standard Tic Tac Toe, Player 0 (O) usually moves first.\n\nSince the board is empty and no one has moved, I am making the **first move of the game**.\n\nTherefore, the best strategic move is to take the **center** to maximize control and future opportunities.\n\nThus, my move is:\n\n[4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1]  Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n I need to analyze the current state of the board.\nMy opponent (O) has placed their symbol in the center (position 4).\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Current Board State:**\n    *   Position 4: O\n    *   All other positions are empty.\n\n2.  **Immediate Winning Moves Available?**\n    *   No, as only one symbol (O) is on the board, and I have not placed any 'X' yet. A win requires three in a row.\n\n3.  **Opponent Winning Moves to Block?**\n    *   No, my opponent has only made one move. There are no immediate threats to block.\n\n4.  **Strategic Positions to Prioritize:**\n    *   My opponent has taken the best strategic position (center). This means they control the most potential winning lines.\n    *   As Player 1 ('X'), my primary goal for the first move is to secure a strong position that offers many potential winning lines and preferably corners.\n    *   The best responses to an opponent taking the center are generally the corners, as they deny the opponent control of adjacent lines and still offer three potential winning lines for myself.\n    *   Placing an 'X' in a corner creates a fork opportunity later on, or at least allows me to create a line with the center O, forcing O to block on the next move.\n\n5.  **Setting up Multiple Winning Threats/Opponent Planning:**\n    *   By placing 'X' in a corner, I immediately create three potential lines (row, column, diagonal) that could eventually lead to a win.\n    *   For example, if I choose position 0:\n        *   Row: 0, 1, 2\n        *   Column: 0, 3, 6\n        *   Diagonal: 0, 4, 8 (This line is partially formed with O in 4)\n    *   This forces my opponent to consider blocking my lines or continuing to build their own. Taking a corner (e.g., 0, 2, 6, or 8) is the standard and strongest response to a center opening.\n\nI will choose the top-left corner (position 0) as my first move. This is a common and strong opening move in response to a center play.\n\n[0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] I need to analyze the current state of the board after my opponent's move.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Current Board State:**\n   - Position 0: X (Player 1)\n   - Position 4: O (Player 0 - me)\n   - All other positions are empty.\n\n   Board:\n   ```\n   X | 1 | 2 \n   ---+---+---\n   3 | O | 5 \n   ---+---+---\n   6 | 7 | 8 \n   ```\n\n2. **Immediate Winning Moves Available?**\n   - No. I have only two moves: O at 4, and X at 0. I need two in a row to have a potential win on next move.\n\n3. **Opponent Winning Moves to Block?**\n   - Currently, Player 1 (X) has only one mark at position 0. No immediate threat of three-in-a-row.\n\n4. **Strategic Positions to Prioritize:**\n   - I already control the center (4), which is excellent.\n   - Player 1 has taken a corner (0), which is also strong.\n   - The remaining corners are 2 (top-right), 6 (bottom-left), and 8 (bottom-right).\n   - The diagonals:\n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-? \u2192 This line has both X and O, so it cannot be completed by either player \u2014 effectively dead.\n     - Diagonal 2-4-6: ?-O-? \u2192 I can build on this diagonal if I take either 2 or 6.\n\n   If I take **corner 8** (bottom-right), the diagonal 0-4-8 becomes X-O-X, which benefits my opponent by completing their line? No \u2014 wait:\n   - If I place O at 8 \u2192 0-4-8 would be X-O-O \u2192 not a threat for X.\n   - But **only X can win on that diagonal**, and they would need another X at 8, but I can prevent that by taking 8.\n\n   However, if I take **corner 2 or 6**, I can start building on the other diagonal (2-4-6) with my O in center.\n\n   Also, consider forks:\n   - If I take a corner, I increase my chance of creating a fork (two winning threats at once) later.\n   - Corners 2, 6, 8 are all viable, but let's evaluate specific threats.\n\n5. **Looking Ahead - Creating Two-in-a-Row:**\n   - My O is at 4.\n   - If I place O at **8**, then:\n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-O \u2192 can't win, but blocks X from completing diagonal.\n     - No two-in-a-row for me yet.\n   - If I place O at **2**:\n     - Top row: X | O | ? \u2192 not strong.\n     - Diagonal 2-4-6: O-O-? \u2192 I have two in a row! Then next move I could win by playing 6, unless blocked.\n     - Column 2: 2,5,8: one O so far.\n\n   Wait \u2014 if I play at **2**:\n   - Diagonal 2-4-6 becomes O-O-?, which is a direct threat: if I get to play 6 later, I win (unless blocked).\n   - Also, I own two corners: 2 and 4 (center), building strong board control.\n\n   Alternatively, if I play at **6**:\n   - Diagonal 2-4-6: ?-O-O \u2192 same thing, but then 2 is empty. Same threat.\n   - Column 6: 0,3,6 \u2192 currently X at 0.\n\n   But note: 0 is X, so if I play in 6, column 0-3-6 becomes X-?-O \u2192 not a threat for me.\n\n   However, **playing in 2 gives:**\n   - Diagonal: 2-4-6 \u2192 O-O-? \u2192 potential win at 6\n   - Top row: 0-1-2 \u2192 X-?-O \u2192 if I get 1, I could threaten, but X already has 0 so not a strong row.\n\n   But here\u2019s a better idea: **take 8**?\n\n   Let me evaluate:\n   - If I play 8, then:\n     - Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-O \u2192 blocks X from winning there.\n     - I control center and corner.\n     - But no two-in-a-row threat.\n\n   Whereas:\n   - If I play **2**, then:\n     - Diagonal: 2-4-6 \u2192 O-O-? \u2192 immediate threat to win at 6.\n   - Then if Player 1 doesn't block 6, I win.\n\n   But wait: Player 1 might not let that happen.\n\n   Is there a better way?\n\n   Alternatively, **take 6**? Same diagonal potential.\n\n   The diagonal 2-4-6 is symmetric. Playing 2 or 6 both create a two-O threat along that diagonal.\n\n   But consider **Player 1's potential plans**:\n   - They have X at 0.\n   - They might want to take 8 next to create a corner pair (0 and 8) and threaten row 0-1-2 or diagonal 0-4-8.\n\n   If I do *not* take 8, Player 1 might take it next, giving them two corners and a strong position.\n\n   However, **my highest priority should be to create a direct winning threat**.\n\n   So:\n   - Playing **2** \u2192 O at 2 and 4, threaten 6 \u2192 win on diagonal.\n   - Playing **6** \u2192 same thing, threaten 2.\n\n   So both 2 and 6 are symmetric in that sense.\n\n   But let\u2019s score:\n   - **Position 2 (top-right corner)**: corner, part of:\n     - Top row (0-1-2)\n     - Right column (2-5-8)\n     - Diagonal (2-4-6) \u2192 I already have 4 \u2192 so I get two-in-a-row threat.\n\n   - **Position 8 (bottom-right)**: corner, part of:\n     - Bottom row (6-7-8)\n     - Right column (2-5-8)\n     - Diagonal (0-4-8) \u2192 already has X and O \u2192 dead, cannot be won by either.\n\n   So diagonal 0-4-8 is **blocked** \u2014 neither player can win there.\n\n   Therefore, **position 8** is less valuable for me because one of its three lines is dead.\n\n   Similarly, position 2: all three lines are still live.\n\n   So **position 2 is better**.\n\n   Position 6: corner, lines:\n     - Left column (0-3-6) \u2192 has X at 0\n     - Bottom row (6-7-8)\n     - Diagonal (2-4-6) \u2192 live, with O at 4\n\n   So both 2 and 6 are good.\n\n   But let's see: if I play **2**:\n   - I create O at 2 and 4 \u2192 threat at 6\n   - Then Player 1 must block by playing 6\n   - Then I can take another corner, maybe 8, and build another threat.\n\n   If I play **6**:\n   - O at 6 and 4 \u2192 threat at 2\n   - Player 1 blocks 2\n   - Then I take 8 or something.\n\n   Same outcome \u2014 symmetric.\n\n   But here's a key point: **position 2 (top-right)** is part of the **right column (2-5-8)** and **top row**.\n\n   However, **top row has X at 0**, so if I play 2, top row is X-?-O \u2192 Player 1 could later take 1 and threaten, but I can block.\n\n   Similarly, if I play 6, left column is X-?-O.\n\n   So both are symmetric.\n\n   But to break symmetry, I should choose a corner that is not adjacent to opponent's corner? Corners are adjacent diagonally.\n\n   Actually, 0 and 2 are adjacent via row, 0 and 6 via column.\n\n   But 0 and 8 are diagonal.\n\n   Wait \u2014 **0 and 2** share a side (top row)\n   **0 and 6** share a column (left column)\n\n   But 0 and 8 are opposite.\n\n   But that doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\n   Best idea: **create an immediate two-in-a-row threat**.\n\n   So I should play either 2 or 6 to create a diagonal threat.\n\n   Let's pick one \u2014 say **2**.\n\n   Move: [2]\n\n   After I play 2:\n   - Board: X | ? | O\n           ? | O | ?\n           ? | ? | ?\n   - Diagonal 2-4-6: O-O-? \u2192 I threaten to win at 6.\n\n   Then Player 1 must respond by blocking at 6.\n\n   That gives me initiative.\n\n   Alternatively, I could play **8** to take a corner and prevent X from having both 0 and 8, but since the diagonal 0-4-8 is dead, it's not crucial.\n\n   And the reward of threatening a win is higher than taking an inactive corner.\n\n   Therefore, best move is to **create a two-O diagonal on 2-4-6**.\n\n   I'll play at **position 2**.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1]  I need to analyze the current state of the board after my opponent's move.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Current Board State:**\n    *   Position 0: X (My symbol)\n    *   Position 2: O (Opponent's symbol)\n    *   Position 4: O (Opponent's symbol)\n    *   All other positions are empty.\n\n    Board:\n    ```\n     X | 1 | O \n    ---+---+---\n     3 | O | 5 \n    ---+---+---\n     6 | 7 | 8 \n    ```\n\n2.  **Immediate Winning Moves Available?**\n    *   No. I have only one 'X' on the board.\n\n3.  **Opponent Winning Moves to Block?**\n    *   Yes, this is critical. My opponent (O) has placed symbols at positions 2 and 4.\n    *   They have created a two-in-a-row threat along the **diagonal 2-4-6**.\n    *   If they place 'O' at position 6 (bottom-left corner) on their next turn, they will win.\n    *   Therefore, I **must block position 6**.\n\n4.  **Strategic Positions to Prioritize:**\n    *   My absolute top priority is to block the opponent's winning move.\n    *   The square I need to block is position 6.\n\n5.  **Setting up Multiple Winning Threats/Opponent Planning:**\n    *   While it's good to set up threats, blocking an immediate winning threat from the opponent takes precedence.\n    *   By playing at 6, I fulfill the blocking requirement.\n    *   Placing 'X' at 6 also creates a new X-line on the diagonal 0-4-8 (X-O-X) and the column 0-3-6 (X-?-X).\n    *   This is a strong defensive and potentially offensive move, as it creates two lines of two 'X's even though one (0-4-8) is blocked by an 'O'. The other, 0-3-6 (X-?-X) is a powerful move, creating a threat on the left column.\n\nMy move is straightforward due to the immediate threat.

(positions 3 and 4), threatening a win at position 5.  \n     - Player 1 will be forced to block my middle-row threat next turn, buying me time.  \n\n5. **Why Not Other Moves?**  \n   - Playing elsewhere (e.g., corner 8) would allow Player 1 to immediately win via position 3.  \n   - *Example*: If I play [8], they play [3] and win left column. This is game over.  \n   - Only [3] prevents an instant loss.\n\n**Conclusion**: Blocking position 3 is the only move that avoids immediate defeat. It also creates a counter-threat in the middle row, forcing Player 1 into defensive play on their next turn.\n\n[3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1]  I need to analyze the current state of the board after my opponent's move.\n\nWARNING: Player 0 placed their symbol in an invalid cell.

(need 7, 8)\n        *   Diagonal (0-4-8): X-O-? (need 8)\n\n    *   **Yes! I have an immediate winning move available at position 3** to complete the column 0-3-6. If I place X at 3, I get three X's in a row (0, 3, 6).\n\n3.  **Opponent Winning Moves to Block?**\n    *   Let's check opponent's lines:\n        *   Row 1 (0-1-2): X-O-O (blocked by X at 0)\n        *   Column 1 (1-4-7): O-O-? (need 7) - **Threat at 7!**\n        *   Column 2 (2-5-8): O-?-? (need 5, 8)\n        *   Diagonal (0-4-8): X-O-? (blocked by X at 0)\n        *   Diagonal (2-4-6): O-O-X (blocked by X at 6)\n\n    *   My opponent has a threat at position 7 (column 1-4-7). If they play 7, they win.\n\n4.  **Priorities: Win vs. Block**\n    *   I have an immediate winning move (at 3).\n    *   My opponent has an immediate winning move (at 7).\n    *   In Tic Tac Toe, you always prioritize your own immediate winning move over blocking an opponent's threat. If I can win, I win. The opponent cannot block me unless they also have a winning move on the same turn, which means I would have already lost or it's a draw, but my move completes the line first.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   I must take position 3 to complete my column (0-3-6) and win the game.\n\nMy move is to win the game.\n\n[3]\n[GAME] Player 1 attempted an invalid move.
