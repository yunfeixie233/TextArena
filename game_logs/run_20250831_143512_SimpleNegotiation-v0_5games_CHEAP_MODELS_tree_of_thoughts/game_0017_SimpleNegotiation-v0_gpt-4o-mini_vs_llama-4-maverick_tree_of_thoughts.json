      "response": "To develop a successful negotiation strategy, I've enlisted three different experts with varied perspectives. Here they are:\n\n### Expert 1: Market Analyst\n**Step 1:**  \nAs a market analyst, my first step is to evaluate the current market values of each resource. We observe that:\n- Wheat: 5  \n- Wood: 11  \n- Sheep: 18  \n- Brick: 20  \n- Ore: 36  \n\nTo maximize the total value, I suggest focusing on resources with high trade value and plentiful supply, specifically Ore and Brick, which have the highest value compared to others. I will consider potential trades that can convert lower-value resources into higher-value ones while increasing overall worth.\n\n### Expert 2: Resource Strategist\n**Step 1:**  \nAs a resource strategist, I analyze the balance of resources I currently hold. The quantities suggest potential surpluses in certain areas. For instance:\n- I have 10 Wheat, but its value is low.\n- I have a surplus of Brick (25) which can easily be traded.\n\nI believe a trade involving excess resources (like Wheat and Wood) could yield me higher-value goods such as Ore or Sheep. My focus will be to trade the less valuable resources while keeping a keen eye on what others may need.\n\n### Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician\n**Step 1:**  \nAs a negotiation tactician, I focus on the art of persuasion and how I can leverage my current holdings. Understanding that others may value different resources more than others helps:\n- I should project confidence in my offers while being prepared to negotiate from a position of strength.\n\nFrom my initial analysis, I can use my abundant resources, like Brick and Sheep, in negotiations. Also, creating appealing offers to potential trading partners could entice them, making it less likely they might deny my exchanges.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps for All Experts\nIn turn two, each expert will generate potential trading offers based on their analyses.\n\n### Expert 1: Market Analyst\n**Step 2:**  \nGiven the high value of Ore, I will propose, **[Offer: 2 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 3 Ore]**. This enables me to convert lower-value resources into a highly valuable commodity.\n\n### Expert 2: Resource Strategist\n**Step 2:**  \nI decide to utilize my excess Sheep to negotiate for other resources that stack better against my already held quantities. I propose, **[Offer: 6 Sheep -> 5 Brick]** since I can afford to let some Sheep go for a valuable resource.\n\n### Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician\n**Step 2:**  \nTo entice others, I will propose a slightly more complex trade that takes both sides\u2019 needs into account. I offer, **[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 4 Ore, 2 Sheep]** which seems attractive for many as it gives away lower-tier resources for what I seek.\n\n---\n\nNow each expert waits for responses to their offers in turn three and will proceed based on acceptance or denial of their trades.",

Thus, it's a bad trade for us.\n\nLet's consider the experts' advice.\n\n1. **The Value Analyst**: Focuses on the monetary value of the resources.\n   - Step 1: \"Let's calculate the value of the offered trade. We're giving away 3 Ore (3*39 = 117) and getting 2 Wheat and 3 Sheep (10 + 54 = 64) in return. This is a loss of 53 in value.\"\n\n2. **The Resource Strategist**: Considers the overall resource distribution and strategy.\n   - Step 1: \"We need to assess if this trade aligns with our resource optimization. We have a surplus of Sheep and a decent amount of Wheat. However, Ore is valuable, and giving away 3 Ore might not be strategic unless we have a surplus.\"\n\n3. **The Risk Manager**: Evaluates the risk associated with the trade.\n   - Step 1: \"Accepting this trade puts us at a significant risk of losing valuable Ore. We should consider if there's a potential future trade that could be more beneficial or if we have enough Ore to spare.\"\n\nGiven the experts' initial analysis, it's clear that the trade is not beneficial for us due to the significant loss in value.\n\nSince the offer is not favorable, the most appropriate action would be to deny it.\n\nAction: [Deny]\n\nLet's proceed to the next turn, where we might receive new offers or continue strategizing based on our current resources and the dynamics of the game.",

      "response": "To maximize the total value of resources in the Negotiation Game, let's involve three different trading experts with unique perspectives: \n\n### Expert 1: The Value Maximizer\nThis expert focuses on maximizing the value of the resources at hand. \n\n- **Step 1:** Analyzing the current resources, the most valuable is Ore (Value: 36). Since we want to increase our total value, we should focus on acquiring more Ore or exchanging lower-value goods like Wheat and Sheep.\n\n- **Next Step:** I suggest offering a combination of resources to acquire more Ore. A feasible trade could be offering 3 Sheep and 2 Wheat for 3 Ore. \n  - **Offer:** **[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 3 Ore]**\n\n### Expert 2: The Resource Controller\nThis expert focuses on controlling the variety of resources to maintain flexibility for future trades.\n\n- **Step 1:** Right now, we have an excess of Brick and some quantity of Sheep. I believe we should consider the possibility of diversifying our resources. We need to ensure that we have a good balance rather than becoming too reliant on any single type of resource.\n\n- **Next Step:** A suggestion could be to trade some of our surplus resources. I propose trading 5 Brick for more diverse items such as Wheat and Ore, which could help make us more competitive. \n  - **Offer:** **[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Wheat, 1 Ore]**\n\n### Expert 3: The Risk Assessor\nThis expert evaluates the risks and potential outcomes of trading scenarios to minimize loss.\n\n- **Step 1:** It's crucial to assess the risk associated with the resources we are willing to trade. Given that we have a reasonable stock of every resource, I suggest that we strategically try to negotiate for a resource that can significantly increase value with less risk of depletion.\n\n- **Next Step:** My approach would be to consolidate trades for more valuable resources and lessen exposure to less valuable ones. Since we need more Ore and it carries a much higher value, I suggest we offer some of our lesser valuable resources. \n  - **Offer:** **[Offer: 2 Wheat, 4 Brick -> 4 Ore]**\n\nNow that each expert has put forward their offers, we can proceed based on their strategies. Since Player 1 rejected my initial offer, I will analyze the current stance and prepare for potential counter-offers as they come. Let's see how Player 1 responds and proceed accordingly.",

      "response": "To tackle this task effectively, let's first understand the current state and the goal. The goal is to increase the total value of the resources. The current resources and their values are:\n- Wheat: 21 (Qty), 5 (Value)\n- Wood: 19 (Qty), 8 (Value)\n- Sheep: 23 (Qty), 18 (Value)\n- Brick: 17 (Qty), 28 (Value)\n- Ore: 16 (Qty), 39 (Value)\n\nLet's calculate the total initial value:\nTotal Value = (21*5) + (19*8) + (23*18) + (17*28) + (16*39)\n             = 105 + 152 + 414 + 476 + 624\n             = 1771\n\nWe have three experts: an Economist, a Game Theorist, and a Trader. Each will analyze the situation from their perspective.\n\n**Turn 1 Analysis**\n\n1. **Economist**: The first step is to evaluate the current portfolio and identify if there's an imbalance that can be corrected through trade. We should look for resources that are over or undervalued relative to their market value or utility. The current offer from Player 0 is 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 3 Ore. Let's calculate the value of the offered and requested resources. \n   - Offered: (3*18) + (2*5) = 54 + 10 = 64\n   - Requested: 3*39 = 117\n   The offer is not in our favor as we're losing value (64 vs 117). We should not accept this offer.\n\n2. **Game Theorist**: We need to consider the strategic aspect of the game. Since Player 0 made two offers already, we should analyze their behavior. The offers are similar, indicating a need for Ore. We should think about what Player 0 might be trying to achieve and whether we can counter-offer to our advantage.\n\n3. **Trader**: From a practical trading perspective, we should look at our resources and see if we can make a profitable trade. We have a decent amount of all resources. Let's examine if we can offer something that we have in abundance relative to its value and request something that is more valuable.\n\n**Decision for Turn 1**\n\nGiven the current offer is not beneficial, the decision is to **[Deny]** the offer from Player 0.\n\nLet's think about making a new offer. We have a significant amount of Sheep and Brick, and Ore is very valuable. If we can trade some of our less valuable resources or those we have in surplus for more Ore or other valuable resources, it could be beneficial.\n\n**New Offer for Turn 1**\n\nBefore making a new offer, let's assess what we can give away and what we want. Since Ore is highly valued and we have a considerable amount of Sheep, let's consider trading some Sheep.\n\nLet's propose: '[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore]'. \n- Offered: 4*18 = 72\n- Requested: 2*39 = 78\n\nThis is a slight gain in value, so it's a potentially good trade.\n\nThe action for Turn 1: **[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore]** \n\nLet's wait for the next turn to see the responses and reactions from Player 0 and adjust our strategy accordingly.",

      "response": "To tackle this negotiation, let's first assess the current situation and the offers made.\n\nInitially, Player 1 has:\n- Wheat: 21 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 19 (Value: 8)\n- Sheep: 23 (Value: 18)\n- Brick: 17 (Value: 28)\n- Ore: 16 (Value: 39)\n\nLet's consider the advice from three different trading experts.\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Analyst\nFocuses on the monetary value of the resources.\n\n### Expert 2: The Trade History Analyst\nAnalyzes the history of trades to understand the opponent's strategy.\n\n### Expert 3: The Resource Optimizer\nLooks at optimizing the portfolio by diversifying or concentrating resources based on their values.\n\nLet's go through the thought process of these experts step by step.\n\n**Turn 1: Analyzing the Current State and Last Offer**\n\n1. **Value Analyst**: The last offer from Player 0 is 5 Sheep, 5 Brick for 4 Ore. Let's calculate the value of what's being offered and requested. \n   - Offered: 5 Sheep (5*18 = 90) + 5 Brick (5*28 = 140) = 230\n   - Requested: 4 Ore (4*39 = 156)\n   The value offered (230) is greater than the value requested (156), so this is a good deal.\n\n2. **Trade History Analyst**: Player 0 has been trying to get Ore in exchange for Sheep and Wheat or Sheep alone. They've increased the offer quantity and quality (including Brick now). This might indicate a strong need for Ore or a strategy to exploit a potential imbalance.\n\n3. **Resource Optimizer**: With 23 Sheep, we're relatively rich in Sheep. Trading some Sheep could be beneficial if we get a good deal. Given that we have 16 Ore, which is a valuable resource, trading 4 Ore for other resources could be considered if the deal is favorable.\n\n**Decision Time for Turn 1**\n\nAll experts seem to think that accepting the offer could be beneficial because of the higher value of the resources being offered compared to what's being requested.\n\nLet's analyze the offer:\n- We give up 4 Ore (4*39 = 156)\n- We get 5 Sheep (5*18 = 90) and 5 Brick (5*28 = 140), totaling 230.\n\nSince the deal is favorable in terms of value, the decision is to accept.\n\n**Action for Turn 1**: `[Accept]`\n\nLet's see how the game unfolds after our decision. \n\nAfter accepting the offer:\n- Sheep: 23 + 5 = 28\n- Brick: 17 + 5 = 22\n- Ore: 16 - 4 = 12\n\nThe game is still ongoing, and we need to consider our next move based on the updated resource quantities and any new offers. \n\n**Waiting for the Next Offer or Making a New One**\n\nLet's proceed with the next turn.\n\n### Turn 2 and Beyond\n\nWe will continue the game, analyzing new offers or making new ones based on the updated situation.\n\n**New Resources After Last Trade**:\n- Wheat: 21\n- Wood: 19\n- Sheep: 28\n- Brick: 22\n- Ore: 12\n\nLet's assume no new offer is made to us, so we need to consider making an offer.\n\n1. **Value Analyst**: Suggests looking for resources that are undervalued in our portfolio and trying to trade for resources that are more valuable or that we lack.\n\n2. **Trade History Analyst**: Since Player 0 was keen on getting Ore, they might be willing to offer a good deal for it. We should consider what we can offer that is not too valuable to us but is valuable to them.\n\n3. **Resource Optimizer**: With an increased amount of Sheep and Brick, we might want to diversify. We are relatively low on Ore now. Perhaps we can offer some Sheep or Brick for Ore or other valuable resources.\n\nLet's think about making an offer.\n\nWe have a good amount of Brick now. Let's consider trading some Brick for Ore since Ore is very valuable and we are running low.\n\n**Proposed Action for Turn 2**: `[Offer: 4 Brick -> 2 Ore]`\n\nThis is just a proposal. We need to analyze if this is a good deal.\n\n- We give up: 4 Brick (4*28 = 112)\n- We get: 2 Ore (2*39 = 78)\n\nThis deal doesn't seem favorable as we're losing value. Let's reconsider.\n\n**Alternative Action**: Let's think about other resources we can trade. We have a lot of Sheep.\n\n`[Offer: 6 Sheep -> 3 Ore]`\n\n- We give up: 6 Sheep (6*18 = 108)\n- We get: 3 Ore (3*39 = 117)\n\nThis deal seems slightly favorable.\n\nLet's go with this offer.\n\n**Action for Turn 2**: `[Offer: 6 Sheep -> 3 Ore]`",

      "response": "Let's analyze your current resources and previous trades before deciding how to proceed in the Negotiation Game. You currently possess:\n\n- **Wheat**: 10 (Value: 5)\n- **Wood**: 10 (Value: 11)\n- **Sheep**: 12 (Value: 18)\n- **Brick**: 25 (Value: 20)\n- **Ore**: 7 (Value: 36)\n\n### Expert 1: Resource Maximization Expert\n**Step 1**: The goal is to increase the total value of resources. It seems that both you and Player 1 are valuing Ore highly, which is a valuable resource. Since you just traded for Ore (5 Sheep and 5 Brick for 4 Ore), you gained value. However, I recommend considering offers that might reuse or balance Sheep since you have an excess (now down to 7 after the trade).\n\n- **Potential Offer**: [Offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\n  \nThis would regain some Ore, enriching your stock once again.\n\n### Expert 2: Risk Assessment Expert\n**Step 2**: Assessing the risk of possible offers is crucial. You acknowledge that both you and Player 1 are currently focused on Ore. The trade cycles through resources that can have high chances of rejection. Players might not want to give away such a valuable resource. \n\nAnalyzing Player 1's last offer (4 Brick for 2 Ore), it\u2019s important to note the value throughout all trades. Consider the risk of not accepting Player 1's Brick for Ore trade when Brick is currently in surplus for you.\n\n- **Response to Player 1**: [Accept] the trade for 4 Brick in exchange for 2 Ore as they might have valuable expansion opportunities ahead.\n\n### Expert 3: Long-term Strategy Expert\n**Step 3**: While short-term trades may bring immediate resource increments, maintaining a balanced resource inventory is critical. You traded 5 Sheep and 5 Brick and acquired Ore, which consolidates your position but can deplete your Sheep supply rapidly. \n\nI suggest maintaining a flow of Sheep and not parting with too many. Consider trading some of your excess Wheat or Wood which are not at peak usage right now.\n\n- **Potential Offer**: [Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 3 Sheep]\n  \nThis keeps resources circulating while strengthening your low Sheep quantity without sacrificing too much balance.\n\n### Summary\nOverall, you have two strategic paths: Accept Player 1's existing offer for useful Brick and balance your resources with future initiatives for Sheep or continue to offer potential trades for Ore to reinforce your position in the game.\n\nNow, for your next action:\n- **Decision**: Accept the trade from Player 1 for Brick, while preparing offers for Sheep or Wood in future trades. \n- Monitor Player 1's next moves for counter-offers and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\n**Action**: [Accept] the offer from Player 1: Offered items: 4 Brick -> Requested items: 2 Ore.",

      "response": "To tackle this task, let's first assess the current situation and the resources available.\n\nInitially, Player 1 has:\n- Wheat: 21 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 19 (Value: 8)\n- Sheep: 23 (Value: 18)\n- Brick: 17 (Value: 28)\n- Ore: 16 (Value: 39)\n\nLet's analyze the trades made so far and the current state after these trades.\n\n1. Player 0 offered: 2 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 3 Ore. Rejected.\n2. Player 1 made no offer.\n3. Player 0 made another offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 3 Ore. Rejected.\n4. Player 1 offered: 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore. Rejected.\n5. Player 0 offered: 5 Sheep, 5 Brick -> 4 Ore. Accepted.\n\nAfter the accepted trade (5):\n- Player 1 gave: 4 Ore\n- Player 1 received: 5 Sheep, 5 Brick\n\nSo, the new quantities for Player 1 are:\n- Wheat: 21\n- Wood: 19\n- Sheep: 23 - 4 + 5 = 24 (since the offer was 5 Sheep received and 4 Sheep given in the previous turn's offer, not this one directly, my calculation is based on the actual turn: 23 - 4 = 19 Sheep before this turn, then received 5 Sheep) = 19 + 5 = 24\n- Correcting this: Initially 23 Sheep, offered 4 Sheep, so 23 - 4 = 19 Sheep. Then received 5 Sheep, so 19 + 5 = 24 Sheep.\n- Brick: 17 + 5 = 22\n- Ore: 16 - 4 = 12\n\nLet's correct the quantities based on the actual transactions:\n1. Initially: Wheat = 21, Wood = 19, Sheep = 23, Brick = 17, Ore = 16\n2. After offering 4 Sheep for 2 Ore (rejected): No change.\n3. After accepting 5 Sheep, 5 Brick for 4 Ore: Sheep = 23 - 4 = 19, then +5 = 24; Brick = 17 + 5 = 22; Ore = 16 - 4 = 12\n\nSo, the correct quantities after the last accepted trade are:\n- Wheat: 21\n- Wood: 19\n- Sheep: 24\n- Brick: 22\n- Ore: 12\n\nThen, Player 1 made an offer: 4 Brick -> 2 Ore. Accepted.\n\n- After this trade: Brick = 22 - 4 = 18; Ore = 12 + 2 = 14\n\nNow, the quantities are:\n- Wheat: 21\n- Wood: 19\n- Sheep: 24\n- Brick: 18\n- Ore: 14\n\nLet's analyze the new offer from Player 0: 4 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Ore.\n\nTo decide, let's consider the value:\n- Giving: 2 Ore (Value: 39 * 2 = 78)\n- Receiving: 4 Sheep (Value: 18 * 4 = 72), 1 Wheat (Value: 5 * 1 = 5)\n- Total value received: 72 + 5 = 77\n\nSince the total value received (77) is less than the total value given (78), this trade is not beneficial.\n\nTo have a diverse analysis, let's consider the perspectives of three different trading experts:\n\n1. **Conservative Trader**: Focuses on not losing value.\n   - Step 1: Assess the current offer. The offer results in a net loss of value (78 - 77 = 1). \n   - Conclusion: Reject the offer.\n\n2. **Risk-Taker**: Looks for potential gains or strategic advantages.\n   - Step 1: Evaluate the immediate gain or loss. The trade results in a slight loss.\n   - Step 2: Consider the long-term implications. Having more Sheep might be beneficial if there's a future trade that values Sheep highly.\n   - Conclusion: Still, the immediate loss is not justified by potential long-term gains without more context.\n\n3. **Resource Optimizer**: Focuses on optimizing the resource portfolio.\n   - Step 1: Analyze the current portfolio and the proposed change. Currently, Ore is valued highly, and giving it away for a slightly lesser value in other resources is not optimal.\n   - Step 2: Consider if the received resources can be used for a future beneficial trade. While having more Sheep or Wheat is not bad, the immediate loss in value is not compensated.\n   - Conclusion: The trade is not optimal.\n\nAll experts conclude that the trade is not beneficial.\n\nGiven the analysis, the decision is to **[Deny]** the offer from Player 0. \n\nThe action is: `[Deny]`",

Sheep also hold substantial value, given their quantity and value per unit.\n2. **Optimal Trading Strategy**: I recommend focusing on maximizing Ore acquisition since it's the highest value resource.

Focus on low-value resources like Brick for trades.\n3. **Next Step Proposal**: I suggest offering 4 Brick for 2 Ore next. This keeps Player 0\u2019s Sheep intact while utilizing Brick, which Player 1 may be willing to trade for.\n\n**Expert 3: Market Analyst**\n1. **Market Trends**: The current dynamics show that both Players are valuing Ore high. For Player 0, maintaining a strong hold on Ore is crucial.\n2. **Benefits of the Current Trades**: Trading Sheep and Brick has secured valuable Ore, positioning Player 0 well. \n3. **Next Steps**: Propose a trade offering 3 Sheep and 3 Brick for 2 Ore, which balances exploitation of low-value resources while still aiming for high-value acquisition.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Actions\n\n1. **Submit a Trade Offer**: To Player 1, use either Expert 1 or Expert 2's suggestion to maximize ore while offloading less valuable resources.\n   - **Offer**: \n   - '[Offer: 4 Brick -> 2 Ore]'\n   - or \n   - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]'\n\n2. **Prepare for Responses**:\n   - If Player 1 accepts, adapt to new resource dynamics.\n   - If Player 1 rejects, I will re-evaluate my offer approach.\n\nGiven the analysis, I will proceed with:\n- **Action**: '[Offer: 4 Brick -> 2 Ore]' \n\nThis maintains flexibility while aiming to enhance my resource portfolio.",

Total Value = (21*5) + (19*8) + (23*18) + (17*28) + (16*39) = 105 + 152 + 414 + 476 + 624 = 1771.\"\n   - Game Theorist: \"We need to think about the potential strategies of Player 0 and how we can leverage our resources to maximize our gain.\"\n   - Trader: \"Looking at the trades so far, Player 0 seems to be interested in Ore. We should consider offers that capitalize on this interest.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Past Trades and Current State (After Turn 8)**\n   - Economist: \"After accepting the trade on Turn 6, we received 5 Sheep and 5 Brick for 4 Ore. Our current resources are: Wheat: 21, Wood: 19, Sheep: (23-4+5) = 24, Brick: (17+5) = 22, Ore: (16-4) = 12. Let's calculate the new total value: (21*5) + (19*8) + (24*18) + (22*28) + (12*39) = 105 + 152 + 432 + 616 + 468 = 1773. We gained 2 in value.\"\n   - Game Theorist: \"The fact that Player 0 is still trying to get Ore suggests they are either lacking it or trying to complete a set. We should consider what they might be willing to give up for it.\"\n   - Trader: \"We've had a positive trade so far. The current offer from Player 0 is 4 Brick for 2 Ore. Let's evaluate this.\"\n\n3. **Evaluating the Current Offer (4 Brick -> 2 Ore)**\n   - Economist: \"Giving up 2 Ore (2*39 = 78) and getting 4 Brick (4*28 = 112) results in a net gain of 34. This is a good trade.\"\n   - Game Theorist: \"Considering the value and the fact that Player 0 accepted our previous offer, it seems they're willing to give up Brick for Ore. This could be a strategic move to get what they need.\"\n   - Trader: \"This trade is beneficial. We should accept it.\"\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the analysis, the trade offer of \"Offered items: 4 Brick -> Requested items: 2 Ore\" from Player 0 is beneficial.\n\n- **Action:** '[Accept]'\n\nLet's proceed with the action.\n\n### Post-Action Analysis\n\nAfter accepting the trade:\n- Wheat: 21\n- Wood: 19\n- Sheep: 24\n- Brick: (22+4) = 26\n- Ore: (12-2) = 10\n\nNew Total Value = (21*5) + (19*8) + (24*18) + (26*28) + (10*39) = 105 + 152 + 432 + 728 + 390 = 1807\n\nThe total value has increased from 1773 to 1807, a gain of 34, as predicted by the Economist.\n\nLet's prepare for the next turn, considering we are on Turn 9 and there's one more turn to go.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nFor Turn 10, we need to think about our next move or respond to any potential offer from Player 0.\n\n- Economist: \"We should look at our current resources and think about what we can offer or request that would increase our total value further.\"\n- Game Theorist: \"Let's anticipate Player 0's next move based on their past behavior and our last trade.\"\n- Trader: \"Considering our current resources, we might want to offer something that we've noticed Player 0 is interested in, like Ore.\"\n\nGiven we have one turn left and no current offer from Player 0, we can make a proactive offer.\n\nLet's analyze our resources again and consider what might be a good trade.\n\n### Proactive Offer for Turn 10\n\nAfter some consideration, the experts come up with the following thoughts:\n\n- Economist: \"We have a good amount of Brick now. Maybe we can trade some Brick for something else valuable.\"\n- Game Theorist: \"Let's think about what Player 0 might be willing to give up. They've shown interest in Ore, but we don't have much left. Perhaps we can offer something else in return for something we value more.\"\n- Trader: \"How about offering some Brick for Wheat or Wood? They are relatively less valuable to us.\"\n\nLet's decide on an offer.\n\n### Decision for Turn 10\n\nLet's propose: '[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Wood]'.\n\nThis is a speculative move, hoping that Player 0 has Wood and is willing to trade.\n\n- **Action:** '[Offer: 3 Brick, 0 Ore -> 2 Wood, 0 Sheep]' simplifies to '[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Wood]'.\n\nLet's see how Player 0 responds.\n\n### Action\n'[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Wood]'",

Here's how three different types of trading experts would approach the negotiation game:\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Analyst\nThe Value Analyst focuses on maximizing overall benefit based on the value of resources.\n1. **Assess Resources:** I currently have:\n    - Wheat: 10 (5 each) = 50\n    - Wood: 10 (11 each) = 110\n    - Sheep: 12 (18 each) = 216\n    - Brick: 25 (20 each) = 500\n    - Ore: 7 (36 each) = 252\n   - **Total Value:** 1128\n2. **Recent Trades:**\n   - Gained 4 Ore and lost 5 Sheep and 5 Brick with Player 1.\n   - Later gained 2 Ore and lost 4 Brick.\n   - Current resources after trades:\n       - Wheat: 10, Wood: 10, Sheep: 7, Brick: 16, Ore: 9\n   - **New Total Value:** (10*5 + 10*11 + 7*18 + 16*20 + 9*36)= 1873\n3. **Next Offer Recommendation:**\n   - Since I have an abundance of Brick and am still seeking Ore, I should offer: \n   - '[Offer: 5 Brick -> 3 Ore]' \n\n### Expert 2: The Resource Strategist\nThe Resource Strategist looks at resource composition and scarcity.\n1. **Evaluate Current Needs:**\n   - Given the limited quantity of Ore, securing more is essential since it's highly valued (36 each).\n   - My current strategy should be to trade surplus resources to acquire scarce ones.\n2. **Recent Trade Analysis:**\n   - Trading 5 Sheep for 4 Ore was unfavorable since it cost me too many high-value Sheep.\n   - I still have remaining Sheep, making them a potential valuable item for trade.\n3. **Next Offer Recommendation:**\n   - I will focus on providing resources that are plentiful but of lower value to seek high-value Ore:\n   - '[Offer: 5 Wheat, 4 Sheep -> 3 Ore]'\n\n### Expert 3: The Negotiator\nThe Negotiator's strength lies in building relationships and understanding opponent psychology.\n1. **Relationship Assessment:**\n   - I've noticed Player 1 often sticks to resources they need, but they have been hesitant to trade for Sheep.\n2. **Previous Offers Review:**\n   - Last offer of 4 Sheep and 1 Wheat was denied because it was too negotiable without enough Ore.\n   - The trend is leaning towards valuing Tryng to keep Sheep. Maybe I should consider their interests.\n3. **Next Offer Recommendation:**\n   - To trade effectively with Player 1, I should look for a balanced offer based on what Player 1 wants.\n   - Thus, I suggest: \n   - '[Offer: 3 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 2 Wood]'\n\nAfter considering the advice from the three experts, I will proceed with these offers in the negotiations. \n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Make Offers:**\n  - Expert 1 will offer: '[Offer: 5 Brick -> 3 Ore]'\n  - Expert 2 will offer: '[Offer: 5 Wheat, 4 Sheep -> 3 Ore]'\n  - Expert 3 will offer: '[Offer: 3 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 2 Wood]'\n  \n### Action Timeline:\n- **Turn 1:** [Offer: 5 Brick -> 3 Ore]\n- **Turn 2:** [Offer: 5 Wheat, 4 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\n- **Turn 3:** [Offer: 3 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 2 Wood]\n\nLet\u2019s see how the negotiations unfold!",
