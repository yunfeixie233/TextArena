      "response": "Let\u2019s consider three different types of trading experts that can provide insight into the best trading strategy: \n\n1. **The Resource Specialist**: This expert focuses on the individual values of resources and helps identify optimal trades based on value.\n\n2. **The Market Analyst**: This expert takes into account current trading trends and the potential value of resources in future trades.\n\n3. **The Strategic Negotiator**: This expert emphasizes the importance of negotiation tactics, advocating for trades that can lead to advantageous future positions.\n\n### Expert Steps\n\n**Expert 1: Resource Specialist**\n- The current resources and their values suggest that Ore is the most valuable resource (17 qty, value of 35). Considering the total values of each resource group, trading lower value resources for higher value ones could maximize overall gain.\n- I propose to offer: **[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]**.\n- This trade increases overall value because Brick can be valuable for future trades.\n\n**Expert 2: Market Analyst**\n- I observe that certain resources may become more valuable in future trades. If our trading opponents have a greater need for Brick and are less inclined to trade for Ore or Wheat, we should leverage the demand for Brick.\n- I propose offering Ore to get Brick since I expect the value of Brick to increase as trades progress due to its utility.\n- I will support: **[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]**.\n\n**Expert 3: Strategic Negotiator**\n- A good negotiation will require flexibility and anticipation of future needs. By focusing on a trade that maintains a balance while giving away some quantity of lower value resources, we can keep our options open.\n- I see value in the proposed trade, as gaining Brick could position us better for future negotiations.\n- I also support: **[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]**.\n\n### Summary\nAll three experts agree on a common strategy to offer: **[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]**. Following the steps, we\u2019ll monitor if this offer is accepted or denied (as this is the first move of the turn).\n\n### Next Steps\nIf the offer is accepted, we will analyze our new inventory and possible next moves. If denied, we will reassess the potential trades based on opponent responses. \n\nLet us proceed with the game's first offer.",

The original offer involved giving up 3 Sheep (54) and 2 Ore (70) for 5 Brick (105) and 2 Sheep (36). The total values show that the trade is beneficial since:\n\n- **Total Value Given**: 54 (Sheep) + 70 (Ore) = 124\n- **Total Value Received**: 105 (Brick) + 36 (Sheep) = 141\n\nThis results in a net gain of 17. Therefore, the initial trade by Player 0 was good.\n\n**Expert 2: Strategic Negotiator**  \n*Analysis Step 1: Understanding Trade Dynamics*  \nGiven that Player 0 has already made a trade offer and Player 1 accepted it, this indicates a willingness to negotiate on both sides. Player 1\u2019s counter-offer is identical to Player 0\u2019s, suggesting no new values or dynamics are added.\n\nI will need to decide if accepting or denying Player 1's counter-offer is in the best interest of long-term relations. I want to maintain a bargaining position that allows for further advantageous trades. However, I should also examine the resources that I would be left with after accepting such offers.\n\n**Expert 3: Risk Analyst**  \n*Analysis Step 1: Evaluating Risks Involved*  \nRisk assessment focuses on understanding what resources Player 0 may need in the future. If Player 0 engages in this trade and significantly parts with Sheep and Ore, I should consider the following:\n\n1. **Future Resource Needs**: If Player 0 anticipates requiring more of those resources for forthcoming trades or to fulfill certain objectives, it might not be wise to trade them for a short-term gain.\n2. **Competition**: Other players may soon require Sheep or Ore, and Player 0's reduced supply can affect subsequent game strategies and outcomes.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n**Expert 1**: I believe Player 0 should consider accepting Player 1's offer due to the positive value gain.  \n**Expert 2**: I suggest Player 0 evaluate future trading options before making a decision.  \n**Expert 3**: My concern urges Player 0 to think about long-term resource sustainability.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the greater resource value and strategic insights, I will **[Accept]** the counter-offer from Player 1 if it aligns with my future goals. \n\n**Final Decision**: [Accept]",

      "response": "To help you navigate through the next steps in the Negotiation Game effectively, I will simulate three distinct trading experts, each with their own specialized focus. \n\n### Expert 1: The Resource Maximizer\n**Step 1**: This expert focuses on ensuring a net gain in total resource value with every trade. Looking at Player 0's current holdings, the total value of resources is calculated as follows:\n- Wheat: 12 * 5 = 60\n- Wood: 13 * 8 = 104\n- Sheep: 15 * 18 = 270\n- Brick: 10 * 21 = 210\n- Ore: 17 * 35 = 595\n**Total Value = 1239**\n\nThis expert proposes a new trade offer to maximize value:\n- **Proposed Offer**: `[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 7 Wood, 4 Brick]`\n\n### Expert 2: The Risk Manager\n**Step 1**: This expert analyzes the risk involved in trading based on the quantity of resources being given away versus received. They note that Player 0 has accepted trades that continuously deplete sheep and ore, valuable resources for future trades.\n- The risk manager suggests consolidating resources to maintain a balance. Player 0 should consider keeping more ore and sheep while trying to trade other resources for items like brick and wood.\n- **Proposed Offer**: `[Offer: 4 Ore, 3 Wood -> 5 Brick, 3 Sheep]`\n\n### Expert 3: The Strategic Trader\n**Step 1**: This expert takes a strategic long-term view, considering possible future trades and builds on relationships with Player 1. They observe Player 1's previous acceptance of trades and might focus on creating goodwill to facilitate easier trades in the future.\n- They are aware of Player 1's last effective trades and suggest initiating a trade that can set up future negotiations favorably.\n- **Proposed Offer**: `[Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Sheep, 4 Brick]`\n\n### Summary\nEach expert proposes a different trade to help Player 0 manage resources effectively. Now it's your turn to decide which expert's trade to pursue based on your strategy preference:\n1. Resource Maximizer: `[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 7 Wood, 4 Brick]`\n2. Risk Manager: `[Offer: 4 Ore, 3 Wood -> 5 Brick, 3 Sheep]`\n3. Strategic Trader: `[Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Sheep, 4 Brick]`\n\nChoose one of these proposals to move forward in the game!",

Value we receive: 7\u00d78 + 4\u00d726 = 152. Net surplus +55.\u201d  \nB: \u201cOur side is heavy on Sheep (17 each) and light on Wood (which is 8). Wood is the scarcest buffer we have. 4-units-of-Buff isn\u2019t trivial.\u201d  \nC: \u201cThe bricks we receive (4) increase a resource we still have in moderate amounts, but the 7 Wood is hungry for space (we have only 13 brick left, Wood low). Could this evolve into an overlapping demand issue?\u201d\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Portfolio check after a hypothetical accept  \nA (recalculates balances on acceptance):  \n- Give: \u20115 Sheep, \u20112 Wheat  \n- Get: +7 Wood, +4 Brick  \nNew counts \u2248: Wheat 19, Wood 16, Sheep 2(!), Brick 17, Ore 20  \nB: \u201cWarning\u2014Sheep drops catastrophically to 2 units; single bad roll could wipe the pile. Wood grows to 16, but its Unit-Price 8 is low; we double-counted in value but undervalue in liquidity.\u201d  \nC: \u201cTrue, but 4 Brick at 26 is comfort insurance. Ore (34) stays untouched; we\u2019re still weighted Ore\u2192Brick heavily in total worth.\u201d\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Risk of not accepting  \nA: \u201cIf we deny and nobody trades again, we miss a +55 surplus.  Similar future packages may require deflating Sheep *and* Ore together, thinning top tier.\u201d  \nB: \u201cYet accepting yields Sheep=2\u2014meaning we can\u2019t finance any future Sheep dump ourselves. We\u2019ll be Sheep-locked.\u201d  \nC: \u201cCounter-play: accept now, but immediately propose a small Sheep buy-back with Ore in the next turn to restore Sheep >5.\u201d\n\nConsensus thus far:  \nAll three experts agree the numeric surplus is large. Only B is alarmed by Sheep falling to 2.\n\nBriefvote  \nA, C: \u201cAccept\u201d  \u2022  B: \u201cReserve judgement.\u201d\n\nConflict Resolution \u2013 B flips stance  \nB: \u201cAfter sleep on it, we *can* scaffold Sheep later.  The market interval now is optimal.  I switch to \u2018Accept\u2019.\u201d\n\nFinal group action (unanimous 3-0)\n\n[Accept]\n\nThen immediately (because three experts ripple-brain in one mind) we send a continuity gap-filler:\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Sheep]\n\nThis back-fills 3 Sheep back into hand without costing Brick, keeping the net value gain of the earlier trade intact.",

      "response": "Let's analyze the current trading scenario using three different types of experts. \n\n### Expert 1: The Value Maximizer\n**Analysis:**  \nThis expert focuses solely on maximizing the total resource value.\n- Current resources: \n  * Wheat: 12 (Value: 5)\n  * Wood: 13 (Value: 8)\n  * Sheep: 10 (Value: 18 after trades)\n  * Brick: 5 (Value from trades)\n  * Ore: 17 (Value: 35)\n\n**Trade Recommendation:**  \nPlayer 0 should focus on obtaining more high-value resources, like Ore and Wood, while reducing Sheep. The prior trades made were beneficial, but looking ahead:\n- Prioritize obtaining resources like Ore and Wood, which significantly enhance value. Sugar is worth less, thus consider trading it away in future trades, if possible.\n\n### Expert 2: The Resource Strategist\n**Analysis:**  \nThis expert looks at future resource utility based on potential trades.\n- Key resources like Brick (5) may be valuable for building or production in subsequent turns.\n- Player 0 should consider holding more essential resources (similar to Ore and Wood) while letting go of surplus resources (like excess Sheep) to facilitate subsequent trades.\n\n**Trade Recommendation:**  \nInstead of making active offers, Player 0 should evaluate Player 1\u2019s needs. Suggest fewer trades involving high-quantity Sheep in favor of aimed trades involving Wood or Ore. Being reactive rather than proactive might yield better trades in the long run.\n\n### Expert 3: The Risk Evaluator\n**Analysis:**  \nThis expert focuses on the risks involved with each trade and the potential market reaction.\n- If Player 0 focuses too much on a single resource type (e.g., Sheep), it might cause over-saturation in their inventory, reducing the trade demand.\n- Monitor Player 1\u2019s response patterns during trades. If those trades continue to produce similar returns, it might signify a limitation on future beneficial trades (incentivizing others to seek different trades).\n\n**Trade Recommendation:**  \nContinue trading but shift the offer variety. After acquiring more Brick and Wood, suggest a more diversified offer that could draw more interest from Player 1. This will reduce the predictability of offers and may quickly offer new options.\n\n### Summary of Actions\n- **Next Step for Player 0:** Offer a different set of resources to Player 1, encouraging a diversified trade while maintaining focus on high-value returns. Example offer could be: \n  - `[Offer: 5 Brick, 3 Ore -> 5 Wood, 4 Wheat]` \n\nThis will maintain the focus on increasing resource value while also redistributing assets in a balanced manner.",

      "response": "In this situation, I'll draft three different trading experts who will analyze the trading moves made thus far and provide insights for future trades. Each expert will have a unique perspective on resource valuation and trading strategy.\n\n### Expert 1: The Resource Value Analyst\nThis expert focuses on maximizing immediate resource value based on market worth.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of Current Trades**\n- Current Resources of Player 0 after trades:\n  - Wheat: 9 (after trading 4 Wheat)\n  - Wood: 13 (no trade)\n  - Sheep: 7 (after trading 8 Sheep)\n  - Brick: 5 (after trading 5 Brick)\n  - Ore: 12 (after trading 3 Ore)\n  \n- Valuation of remaining resources:\n  - Wheat: 9 * 5 = 45\n  - Wood: 13 * 8 = 104\n  - Sheep: 7 * 18 = 126\n  - Brick: 5 * 21 = 105\n  - Ore: 12 * 35 = 420\n  - **Total Value: 800**\n\n**Future Offer Recommendation:**\n- Offer [5 Wheat, 2 Sheep] for [3 Brick, 4 Wood] (Maximize access to Brick and Wood, which have high trading potential).\n\n### Expert 2: The Strategic Negotiator\nThis expert is skilled in reading opponents and negotiating advantageous trades.\n\n**Step 1: Opponent's Trading Behavior**\n- Player 1 seems to value Sheep and Ore highly, as they accepted trades that provided them with more of these resources.\n- Player 1 is likely to accept future trades that give them Wood or Wheat in exchange for bricks or ore.\n\n**Future Offer Recommendation:**\n- Offer [3 Ore, 2 Brick] for [7 Wheat, 4 Sheep]. This way, you appeal to Player 1's interests while maximizing your profit margin on the higher-value resources (Wheat and Sheep).\n\n### Expert 3: The Risk Management Specialist\nThis expert evaluates trades emphasizing risk and long-term strategy.\n\n**Step 1: Risk Assessment of Current Position**\n- Current trades have reduced diversity in resources for Player 0 (lower Sheep & Wheat).\n- Risk of over-reliance on Ore and Brick for future trades. \n\n**Future Offer Recommendation:**\n- Diversification is crucial, so I recommend trading [7 Brick] for [5 Ore, 5 Wood]. This helps balance the portfolio and reduces risk of resource scarcity.\n\n### Summary of Recommendations:\n1. **Resource Value Analyst:** Offer  [5 Wheat, 2 Sheep] for [3 Brick, 4 Wood].\n2. **Strategic Negotiator:** Offer [3 Ore, 2 Brick] for [7 Wheat, 4 Sheep].\n3. **Risk Management Specialist:** Offer [7 Brick] for [5 Ore, 5 Wood].\n\nI will now proceed with one of these offerings based on inputs from the experts. Let's analyze further before drafting an offer!",
