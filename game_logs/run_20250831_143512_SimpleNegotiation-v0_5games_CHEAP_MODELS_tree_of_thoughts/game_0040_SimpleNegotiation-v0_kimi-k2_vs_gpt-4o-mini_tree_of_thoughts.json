      "response": "Step 1 \u2013 introducing the three advisors\n---------------------------------------\nAdvisor A \u2013 \u201cMarginal-Value Analyst\u201d:  \n_\"I will compute what the proposed trade does to the *marginal* (not total) value of every resource we own, based on the value per unit you listed. If the sum of values we give up is lower than the sum we receive, the trade is positive. I must recalculate after every single trade to decide whether we accept.\"_\n\nAdvisor B \u2013 \u201cScarcity & Opportunity Strategist\u201d:  \n_\"I focus less on the straight value-per-unit and more on how scarce each resource already is in our inventory. For example, even if Ore has a high individual value, if we have too little Ore to build the structures we want later, keeping it outweighs the numeric gain from trading it. I will track inventory levels and long-term structures first, values second.\"_\n\nAdvisor C \u2013 \u201cBuild-Order Planner\u201d:  \n_\"I always work backwards from what we *eventually* need to build. If we can identify a clear build path (e.g., a city plus a wonder), and the trade brings us materially closer to that build today or in the next few rounds, then it\u2019s good independent of isolated value tables. Otherwise, no.\"_\n\n\nStep 2 \u2013 each advisor shares their initial data scan\n---------------------------------------------------\nAdvisor A (Marginal-Value Analyst) \u2013 instant scal-pad:  \n- Values departing: 3 Sheep \u00d7 15  +  2 Ore \u00d7 35 = 45 + 70 = 115.  \n- Values arriving: 5 Brick \u00d7 27  +  2 Sheep \u00d7 15 = 135 + 30 = 165.  \nNet value swing = +50. \u21d2 On pure arithmetic, the trade is profitable.\n\nAdvisor B (Scarcity & Opportunity) \u2013 inventory scan:  \nCurrent counts: Wheat 20 (low value, not in offer), Wood 17 (moderately scarce), Sheep 8 (third scarcest), Brick 23 (most abundant in counts), Ore 14 (second scarcest).  \nProblematic: we\u2019d be *giving* 2 Ore (scarce) and *receiving* 5 Brick (already the most abundant). Over-stock of Brick could choke future storage or reduce negotiation leverage. Sheep remains at 7 total after trade\u2014not critically low.\n\nAdvisor C (Build-Order Planner) \u2013 hypothetical plans check:  \nCommon mid-game builds \u2192 3 Ore + 2 Wheat for a city, or 2 Brick + 1 Wood for a road, etc. Trade would leave us *without* our 3 Ore (currently 14 \u2192 12), making a city attempt *next turn* harder. Brick surplus (23 \u2192 28) won\u2019t directly enable any immediate build unless paired with Wood and Wheat in right proportions.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 cross-expert reflection before decision\n------------------------------------------------\nAdvisor A concedes: \u201cRaw value swing is good, but I have not looked at scarcity or future build paths. Those could wipe out the numeric gain.\u201d\n\nAdvisor B adds: \u201cWe\u2019re off-loading Ore precisely when it is a short-supply building block. Marginal valuations above ignore *function*\u2014they treat each resource as 100 % liquid, which may not hold.\u201d\n\nAdvisor C: \u201cRoads and settlements both need Brick, but granting 2 more Ore away now *delays* the city upgrade we might want in 2 turns. Brick stack alone doesn\u2019t finish any high-multiplier project.\u201d\n\nConclusion \u2013 unanimous stop sign  \nNone of the advisors see the numeric edge as overriding the *utility deficit* caused by losing scarce Ore when we currently have abundant Brick.

      "response": "Let's analyze the situation and consider the steps as trading experts would approach the negotiation.\n\n### Expert 1: Resource Maximization Specialist\n**Step 1:** \nI would first calculate the total value of my current resources. \n- Wheat: 13 * 5 = 65\n- Wood: 5 * 12 = 60\n- Sheep: 19 * 12 = 228\n- Brick: 11 * 28 = 308\n- Ore: 16 * 36 = 576\n\n**Total Value:** 65 + 60 + 228 + 308 + 576 = 1237.\n\nThe resources that I am proposing (3 Sheep and 2 Ore) have the value of:\n- 3 Sheep: 3 * 12 = 36\n- 2 Ore: 2 * 36 = 72\n**Total Offer Value:** 36 + 72 = 108.\n\nThe requested resources (5 Brick and 2 Sheep) have the value of:\n- 5 Brick: 5 * 28 = 140\n- 2 Sheep: 2 * 12 = 24\n**Total Request Value:** 140 + 24 = 164.\n\n**Conclusion:** The offer made is not benefitting me as I am offering resources with a value of 108 in exchange for 164. Player 0\u2019s rejection keeps this value disparity intact.\n\n---\n\n### Expert 2: Risk Minimization Strategist\n**Step 2:** \nI will evaluate if there's a risk in continuing with Player 0 based on past trades and the current offer dynamics. I suggest that instead of relying on a single offer, I should prepare a diversified strategy to mitigate risk.\n\n**New Offer Idea:** Consider offering a smaller quantity of Sheep (1) and a smaller amount of Ore (1) in exchange for a different resource, or approach Player 0 with more favorable terms to make the deal more appealing.\n\n### Proposal:\n- **New Offer:** [Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]\n\n**Analysis:** \n- Offered Resources: 1 Sheep + 1 Ore = 12 + 36 = 48\n- Requested Resources: 2 Brick = 2 * 28 = 56\n\nThis offer holds a better equilibrium, bringing value both to me and Player 0.\n\n---\n\n### Expert 3: Long-Term Strategy Advisor\n**Step 3:** \nIn considering the long-term implications, I would suggest to avoid getting into resource deficits early in the game. Instead, focus on balancing my resource allocation.\n\n**Advice:**\nContinue engaging with Player 0 in subsequent offers but seek to use my excess resources (like Sheep and Ore) wisely to acquire essential resources necessary for growth, especially if I observe any resource scarcity in Player 0's stock.\n\n**Next Plan:** \nInstead of 3 Sheep and 2 Ore, I can offer smaller sets and engage more frequently, adjusting offers based on Player 0's stock after their potential reactions.\n\n**End of Round Offer Next Suggestions:**\n- Research and negotiation with other players for other resources like Wheat or Wood if no favorable agreement can be reached with Player 0. \n\n### Summary\nIn conclusion, \n1. **Resource Maximization:** Look for a higher value exchange.\n2. **Risk Minimization:** Prepare smaller, less risky trades.\n3. **Long-Term Growth:** Plan for future trades with diversified resources.\n\nThis strategic approach keeps my total resource value trending up while maximizing the chance for successful trades. Moving forward, I'll propose smaller offers for another round and keep my eye open for new opportunities from other players. \n\n**Next Action:** New offer to Player 0 should be [Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 2 Brick].",

      "response": "Let\u2019s bring in three distinct specialists and let them take turns to refine the plan.  \nExpert-\u03b1 is a human calculator: they compute marginal value and balance sheets on the fly.  \nExpert-\u03b2 is a market-maker: they think about scarcity, exchange rates, and deal psychology.  \nExpert-\u03b3 is a long-horizon strategist: they worry about run-away resource choke-points late in the game.\n\nTurn 1 \u2013 Initial appraisals  \nExpert-\u03b1: \u201cCurrent ledger:  \n   20 Wheat (100) + 17 Wood (204) + 8 Sheep (120) + 23 Brick (621) + 14 Ore (490) = 1 535 total.  \nIf I were to accept 2 Sheep + 1 Ore \u2192 3 Brick, I\u2019d lose 2\u00b715 + 35 = 65 and gain 3\u00b727 = 81, a net +16.  \nBut they already offered the same numbers yesterday and we rejected; we should not signal desperation.\u201d  \nExpert-\u03b2: \u201cNotice Player-1 has reversed the exchange rate from 5 Brick:2 Ore two days ago to now only 3 Brick:2 Ore. That\u2019s a price improvement (we get more brick for our sheep/Ore), but we still oversupply Brick at 23 while holding only 14 Ore. We look strong in Ore; I bet Player-1 wants to drain our Ore and Brick simultaneously.\u201d  \nExpert-\u03b3: \u201cTen-turn game, only five trading days left after today. End-games often reward having the scarcest goods. Ore is top-priced and scarce; letting it go at par feels inefficient. We need a plan to grab either Ore-returns later or chunk Wood/Sheep upgrades.\u201d\n\nTurn 2 \u2013 Framing counter-offers  \nExpert-\u03b1: \u201cRational exchange rate should be 1 Ore \u2248 1.3 Brick today. Any 3-for-3 proposal with Ore must yield at least 35 value outgoing. Let\u2019s create an offer where we net value and tilt liquidity.\u201d  \nExpert-\u03b2: \u201cHow about a bait-and-switch? Offer Player-1 Wood/Wheat instead of Ore, areas where we have oversupply. Compress the ask so they think we\u2019re \u2018diversifying\u2019 when in truth we just rebalance.\u201d  \nExpert-\u03b3: \u201cCombine goals: secure more Ore in the long run, and prop up Sheep count. Let\u2019s craft an offer that swaps \u2018disguised bulk\u2019 for single high-value pieces: 3 Wheat + 2 Wood for 1 Ore + 1 Sheep. Net value +38 for us, and seeds future Ore recycling.\u201d\n\nAfter brief huddle the panel converges on the numeric shape from Expert-\u03b3, only trimming one Wheat to appear less greedy and to hit an exactly zero-waste valuation bump:\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]\n\nTurn 3 \u2013 Final sanity check  \nExpert-\u03b1 re-runs the numbers: outgoing 2\u00b75 + 2\u00b712 = 34, incoming 35 +15 = 50 \u2192 net +16.  \nExpert-\u03b2: \u201cMarket sentiment check: after yesterday\u2019s rejections, modest ask may get accepted. It also keeps our Brick hoard intact so Player-1 can\u2019t finish some mega-city they\u2019re hinting at.\u201d  \nExpert-\u03b3: \u201cLong-run, Ore rises above 35 as pieces exhaust. One extra Ore now is worth pushing the bid up to par even at less spectacular ratios; central limit theorem on end-game scarcity supports.\u201d\n\nUnanimous agreement.\n\nPlayer 0 publishes the new trade offer to the table:\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]",

      "response": "Let's analyze the situation from three distinct perspectives to maximize the value of resources through strategic trading in the Negotiation Game:\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Maximizer\nThis expert focuses primarily on maximizing the total value of Player 1's resources through calculated trades.\n\n1. **Current Resource Values**:\n   - Wheat: 13 qty at 5 = 65\n   - Wood: 5 qty at 12 = 60\n   - Sheep: 19 qty at 12 = 228\n   - Brick: 11 qty at 28 = 308\n   - Ore: 16 qty at 36 = 576\n   - **Total Value** = 65 + 60 + 228 + 308 + 576 = 1237\n\n2. **Trade Offer Analysis**:\n   The trade offer from Player 0 (2 Wheat, 2 Wood for 1 Ore, 1 Sheep) must be analyzed:\n   - Value of 2 Wheat: 2 * 5 = 10\n   - Value of 2 Wood: 2 * 12 = 24\n   - Total value offered = 34\n   - Value in return (1 Ore + 1 Sheep): 36 + 12 = 48\n   - **Net Gain** if accepted: 48 - 34 = 14\n\nThis trade is beneficial due to the net gain of 14 in value. \n\n#### First Step:\n- Accept the offered trade.\n- **Action**: [Accept]\n\n### Expert 2: The Strategic Negotiator\nThis expert evaluates the trading relationships and potential future deals.\n\n1. **Current Trading Position**:\n   The reasoning here is to consider not just immediate gains but also the longer-term relationships and future trades.\n\n2. **Considerations**:\n   The repeated refusals from Player 0 indicate reluctance to trade with Player 1 as preferred. Accepting Player 0's current trade offer can improve relations, which may allow more favorable trades in the future.\n\n3. **Trade Offer Impact**:\n   Although the current offer has value, improving Player 1\u2019s relationship with Player 0 and establishing goodwill can yield better trades later on.\n\n#### First Step:\n- Accept the offered trade for the strategic future relationship.\n- **Action**: [Accept]\n\n### Expert 3: The Opportunity Cost Evaluator\nThis expert weighs the opportunity costs of trades and looks for alternatives that could result in better value.\n\n1. **Current Position Analysis**:\n   Analyzing the resource situation, the focus is on the overall strategy rather than just the current trades.\n\n2. **Potential Trades**:\n   Player 1 has a lot of Sheep and Brick, both of high demand. If Player 0 does not accept current trades, it might be better to seek alternative trades or trade with other players if possible.\n\n3. **Session Analysis**:\n   The continuous refusal from Player 0 indicates either a better trade option exists for Player 0 or they do not perceive the current trades as advantageous. Thus, it may be wise to either pivot away from trades with Player 0 or escalate the offerings significantly (large quantities that make the trades attractive).\n\n#### First Step:\n- Wait and observe for possible better trades or reevaluate against other players.\n- **Action**: [Deny]\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Actions\n- Expert 1: [Accept]\n- Expert 2: [Accept]\n- Expert 3: [Deny]\n\nGiven the alignment in acceptance from Experts 1 and 2, Player 1 is encouraged to accept the trade offer from Player 0 since it increases total resource value and fosters a potential better relationship for future trades.",

      "response": "Let's analyze the situation and come up with a strategy to maximize the total value of resources through trades.\n\n### Expert Analysis\n\n#### Expert 1: Value Maximizer\n- **Strategy**: Focus on maximizing the overall value of Player 1's resources by balancing trades.\n- **Current Resources**:\n  - Wheat (13 x 5 = 65)\n  - Wood (5 x 12 = 60)\n  - Sheep (19 x 12 = 228)\n  - Brick (11 x 28 = 308)\n  - Ore (16 x 36 = 576)\n- **Total Value**: 1,237\n- **Trading Focus**: Resource types that can bring in high-value items, like Ore and Brick.\n- **Next Step**: I suggest keeping an eye on trades for Ore and Brick, presenting an offer that maximizes immediate value, such as seeking Brick from Player 0 in exchange for Sheep, which are relatively cheaper compared to the value.\n\n#### Expert 2: Resource Cycles\n- **Strategy**: Focus on maintaining a cycle of resources that are needed for future trades or developments.\n- **Current Resource Analysis**: \n  - High quantities of Sheep and Wool. However, Player 1 is low on Ore after trading with Player 0.\n- **Next Step**: Offer resources that Player 0 may find valuable but also ensure that Player 1 increases their resource diversity. Proposed offer: [Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore]. This could help acquire Ore for more impactful trades later on.\n\n#### Expert 3: Aggressive Trader\n- **Strategy**: Push for aggressive trades that may not seem equitable at first glance but lead to dominating positions later.\n- **Current Resource Analysis**: Player 0 has refused multiple offers, indicating they may not see the value in them. Aggressive tactics might show increased willingness to trade.\n- **Next Step**: I suggest an offer that uses a bulk of a resource: [Offer: 10 Sheep -> 4 Ore]. This might pressure Player 0 into accepting, particularly if they are low on specific resources they initially did not perceive as valuable.\n\n### Next Action\nGiven the insights from each expert, Player 1 should construct a strategy for the next round of trading.\n\nAfter considering the analysis:\n- I will make an offer to Player 0 that focuses on acquiring Ore, a crucial resource that could help me in future trades.\n- **Offer**: [Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\n### Summary of Actions\nI will now proceed with the offer.\n\n**Next Action:** [Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
