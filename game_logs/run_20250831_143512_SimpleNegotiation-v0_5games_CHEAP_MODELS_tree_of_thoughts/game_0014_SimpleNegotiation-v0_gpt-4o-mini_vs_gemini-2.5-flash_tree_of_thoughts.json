I need to calculate the value of what we are giving up versus the value of what we are gaining.\nValue of resources offered: (3 Sheep * $12/Sheep) + (2 Ore * $36/Ore) = $36 + $72 = $108.\nValue of resources requested: (5 Brick * $30/Brick) + (2 Sheep * $12/Sheep) = $150 + $24 = $174.\nBased purely on these numbers, we are giving up $108 in value to gain $174 in value. This appears to be a favorable trade with a net gain of $66.\"\n\n**The Strategic Thinker:**\n\"My initial thought is to analyze the 'why' behind Player 0's offer. They are offering two of their most valuable resources (Ore and Sheep) for Brick, which is also valuable, and some Sheep back. This suggests they might be very rich in Ore and Sheep and desperately need Brick, or they see a higher future utility for Brick. It also slightly changes the type of Sheep we end up with. This trade feels a bit like they're trying to offload highly valuable but perhaps less 'buildable' resources for something they can immediately use. We need to consider what our own strategic needs are.\"\n\n**The Resource Manager:**\n\"My immediate assessment focuses on our current inventory. We have 17 Sheep and 13 Ore. Giving up 3 Sheep and 2 Ore means we'd be left with 14 Sheep and 11 Ore. We currently have 17 Brick. Gaining 5 Brick means we'd have 22 Brick. The 2 Sheep we get back means our Sheep count would ultimately drop from 17 to 14. This trade significantly increases our Brick count, which is our second most valuable resource currently by unit price, after Ore. It also thins out our Ore slightly, which is our most valuable resource. We need to consider if our current quantities of Sheep and Ore are sufficient to comfortably part with some, and if an increased Brick supply aligns with our internal resource optimization goals.\"",

I recommend that Player 0 consider what resources Player 1 might want.\n\nPlayer 0 could diversify their offers. Instead of proposing 3 Sheep and 2 Ore for Brick, they could try offering them Wheat or Wood, which are also valuable and may evoke more interest from Player 1.\n\n---\n\nExpert 3 - Negotiation Tactician:\nStep 1: In negotiation, it\u2019s essential to understand what both parties need. Since Player 1 did not offer a counter, I recommend that Player 0 engage Player 1 directly to inquire about their needs.\n\nI'll suggest an alternative offer that incorporates more flexibility.

We should identify resources that are currently valuable in trades with others or adjust the offer to include a balance of high-valued items.\n\nI propose we offer a combination that potentially appeals more, such as:\n- [Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 4 Ore]\n(We're trying to entice with a balance of mid-value resources.)\n\n### Step 3: Risk Management Expert\nThe rejections indicate that Player 1 is either not seeing the benefit in our trades or may have a surplus of the requested resources.

I have a lot of Wheat, Sheep, and Brick. Brick and Ore have the highest value per unit.\n\n---\n**Expert 2: The Strategic Trader**\n\nI will consider the long-term implications of trades beyond just immediate value. While maximizing value is important, maintaining a balanced portfolio of resources can be crucial for future opportunities. I should also consider how much of each resource I have, not just its unit value. I have a lot of Wheat and Sheep, which are relatively low in value, and a good amount of Brick, which is high in value.\n\n---\n**Expert 3: The Opponent Analyst**\n\nI will try to infer Player 0's needs and resource strengths based on their past offers. Player 0 has consistently tried to acquire Brick and Ore from me, which are my highest-value resources. This suggests they might have a surplus of lower-value resources like Wheat or Wood, or simply value Brick and Ore highly for their own unknown objectives. Their last offer of Wood and Sheep for Brick and Ore confirms they are willing to part with lower-value goods to get higher-value ones.\n\n---\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\n\nFrom a pure value perspective, I want to trade away resources where I have a large quantity and/or relatively low unit value, for resources where I have a smaller quantity and/or high unit value.\nWheat (Value 5, Qty 20) is my lowest value resource. Wood (Value 11, Qty 8) is also low value and I have less of it. Sheep (Value 12, Qty 17) is good, but I have a lot. Brick (Value 30, Qty 17) and Ore (Value 36, Qty 13) are my prize possessions due to their high unit value.\n\nI am most willing to give up Wheat and then Sheep. I most want to acquire more Ore and then Brick, as they have the highest per-unit value.\n\n---\n**Expert 2: The Strategic Trader**\n\nGiven my current inventory, I have a large stockpile of Wheat (20 units) and Sheep (17 units). These are also lower value items. Conversely, my Wood supply is relatively low (8 units), though its value is also not great. My Brick and Ore stocks are good in quantity and excellent in value. I should aim to slightly reduce my Wheat and Sheep while trying to bolster my high-value resources, *or* convert low-value resources into other high-value resources. Balancing quantity while increasing total value is key.\n\n---\n**Expert 3: The Opponent Analyst**\n\nPlayer 0's persistence in requesting Brick and Ore means they likely value these heavily. They have offered Wheat, Wood, and Sheep in their previous attempts. This confirms my suspicion that they are resource-rich in these lower-value goods and seek to acquire higher-value resources. I should leverage this by offering them resources they desire (Brick/Ore) but only if I get something exceptionally valuable in return, or if I can offload a *significant* amount of my low-value resources for a comparatively smaller amount of high-value resources.\n\n---\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\n\nConsidering all points, I want to divest my cheapest abundant resources for my most expensive and high-demand resources. I will try to offer Wheat, as it is my lowest value resource. I have 20 units of it. I want to acquire Ore, as it is my highest value resource.\n\nLet's propose trading a significant amount of Wheat for a smaller amount of Ore. For example, 10 Wheat (value 50) for 2 Ore (value 72). This would be a gain of 22 in total value.\n\n---\n**Expert 2: The Strategic Trader**\n\nI agree with Expert 1 that Wheat is a primary candidate for trade due to its low value and high quantity. Trading 10 Wheat for 2 Ore makes strategic sense \u2013 I get rid of 10 low-value units and gain 2 high-value units, improving both my portfolio balance and total value. I would also be open to trading Sheep, but Wheat is the priority.\n\n---\n**Expert 3: The Opponent Analyst**\n\nPlayer 0 values Ore. Offering Wheat, which they've previously been willing to give up (though not directly for Ore *from me* in past offers), for Ore is a direct play to their perceived need. The 10 Wheat for 2 Ore offer seems reasonable from my side given the value increase for me. Player 0 might accept this if they are truly desperate for Ore and have an abundance of Wheat. It's a significant exchange in terms of quantity, which might appeal to them if they are trying to \"convert\" quantity into quality.\n\n---\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",

Player 0 seems to be valuing Brick and Ore highly, which aligns with my own valuation, especially for Brick. Player 0 has offered combinations of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep for Brick and Ore. My previous offer of '10 Wheat -> 2 Ore' was denied.\n\nI need to make a trade that increases my total value. This means getting resources I value highly, and giving away resources I value less, ideally at a favorable exchange rate. My Brick and Ore are my most valuable resources per unit. Wheat and Wood are my least valuable.\n\nHere are the experts I will consult:\n1. **The Resource Strategist:** Focuses on optimizing the overall resource portfolio, identifying high-value targets and low-value expendables.\n2. **The Value Maximizer:** Calculates the precise value of every possible trade and only proposes trades that guarantee a significant value increase.\n3. **The Market Analyst:** Observes past trades and player behavior to predict what trades might be accepted by the opponent, focusing on finding common ground.\n\n---\n### Expert 1: Resource Strategist\nOur primary goal is to increase total value. Looking at our current portfolio, Wheat and Wood are our lowest value-per-unit resources. Conversely, Brick and Ore are our highest value-per-unit resources. Our strategy should be to convert lower-value resources into higher-value ones, even if it means giving up a larger quantity of the low-value resource for a smaller quantity of the high-value one, as long as the total value gained exceeds the total value lost.\n\n---\n### Expert 2: Value Maximizer\nLet's quantify the value of our resources currently available for trade:\n- Wheat: 5 Gp/unit\n- Wood: 11 Gp/unit\n- Sheep: 12 Gp/unit\n- Brick: 30 Gp/unit\n- Ore: 36 Gp/unit\n\nBased on our current values, we would ideally want to acquire Brick (30 Gp/unit) or Ore (36 Gp/unit). We could sacrifice Wheat (5 Gp/unit) or Wood (11 Gp/unit). To ensure a significant value increase, the value of the requested items must be substantially higher than the value of the offered items. Considering Player 0 seems interested in Brick and Ore, we need to carefully value what we are willing to give up relative to what we want to gain. A simple ratio calculation for potential trades is crucial.\n\n---\n### Expert 3: Market Analyst\nPlayer 0's previous offers show a consistent pattern: they want Brick and Ore. They offered Wheat, Wood, and Sheep in exchange. This suggests they might be short on Brick and Ore, or they value them particularly highly for their own unknown objectives. My previous offer of '10 Wheat -> 2 Ore' was denied, suggesting either the quantity of Wheat was too high for 1 Ore, or they value 1 Ore more than my 50 Gp offer, or they simply weren't interested in Wheat. Player 0 has also denied offers where they would receive Sheep, indicating Sheep might not be a high priority for them right now, at least not for the quantities offered. We need to find a trade that appeals to their demonstrated need for Brick or Ore, while not overpaying from our side. This means we might need to offer a mix of lower-value resources, or a slightly higher volume of them, to get the high-value resources we desire.\n\n---\n### Expert 1: Resource Strategist\nOkay, so the low-value resources are Wheat and Wood. The high-value resources are Brick and Ore. Player 0 clearly wants Brick and Ore. This is fortunate, as these are also the resources we want to accumulate or at least not give away cheaply. We have ample Wheat (20 units) compared to Wood (8 units). Given the past rejections, our previous offer of 10 Wheat for 2 Ore (50 Gp for 72 Gp, a gain of 22 Gp) was not appealing enough for Player 0. We need to sweeten the deal, but for us, not by giving away our valuable resources. Let's consider offering Wheat and/or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\n---\n### Expert 2: Value Maximizer\nTo identify a good offer, let's analyze some potential trades to maximize our value gain.\nScenario 1: Offering Wheat for Ore. Player 0 rejected 10 Wheat (50 Gp) for 2 Ore (72 Gp). We know 1 Ore is 36 Gp. Player 0's earlier offers included 4 Wheat (20 Gp) + 10 Wood (110 Gp) for 5 Brick (150 Gp) + 2 Ore (72 Gp) = 222 Gp. This was an exchange of 130 Gp for 222 Gp, a gain of 92 Gp for Player 0. This gives us insight: they are willing to offer a significant amount of low-value resources to gain high-value ones.\nLet's consider offering a higher volume of Wheat or a combination of Wheat and Wood for 1 or 2 Ore. For example, 15 Wheat (75 Gp) for 2 Ore (72 Gp) would be a direct loss for us. We need to be on the winning side of the value exchange. How about 15 Wheat (75 Gp) for 1 Ore (36 Gp)? This is a loss. We need to be more strategic. We need to offer something they might value, while we gain more value.\n\nLet's try to get 1 Ore (36 Gp) for a combination of Wheat and Wood.\nWhat if we aim for 1 Brick (30 Gp)?\nMy previous offer of '10 Wheat -> 2 Ore' was rejected. If a 22 Gp gain for me wasn't enough, I need to try to propose a trade that gives Player 0 a better incentive while still netting me a positive value.\nWhat if I target *one* unit of a desired resource?\nTo get 1 Ore (36 Gp), I could offer 3 Wood (33 Gp) and 1 Wheat (5 Gp) = 38 Gp. A net loss of 2 Gp for me. Not good.\nHow about 5 Wood (55 Gp) for 2 Ore (72 Gp)? Still too much for me to give up.\nLet's consider 1 Brick (30 Gp).\nIf I offer 4 Wood (44 Gp) for 1 Brick (30 Gp), it's a loss.\n\nGiven Player 0 values Brick and Ore, and rejects my '10 Wheat -> 2 Ore' offer, perhaps the quantity of Ore was too high for what I offered, or simply 10 Wheat isn't enough. I need to push for a smaller number of high-value resources.\n\nHow about targetting 1 Ore, as it's the highest value at 36 Gp.\nWhat if I offer a mix of my lower value resources like Wheat and Wood?\nIf I offer 7 Wheat (35 Gp) and 1 Wood (11 Gp) for 1 Ore (36 Gp), I'm offering 46 Gp to get 36 Gp. This is a loss of 10 Gp.\nThis is difficult. I want to increase my *total* value, but Player 0 also wants to increase their value, and they value Brick & Ore highly.\n\nThe key is to find *their* perceived value for the resources. They offered 4 Wheat + 10 Wood (130 Gp) for 5 Brick + 2 Ore (222 Gp). This implies they value the Brick/Ore they are getting significantly more than the Wheat/Wood they are giving up.\n\nLet's look at it from Player 0's perspective. If they are willing to give up 130 Gp (their value) to gain 222 Gp (my value), their gain is 92 Gp.\nWhat if I offer a trade that gives Player 0 *some* gain, but gives *me* a larger gain?\n\nI want Ore (36 Gp) or Brick (30 Gp). I have plenty of Wheat (5 Gp).\nLet's try to get 1 Ore.\nWhat if I offer 12 Wheat for 1 Ore? (60 Gp for 36 Gp). This is a loss. No.\nWhat if I offer 5 Wheat (25 Gp) for 1 Brick (30 Gp)? This is a gain of 5 Gp.\nOr 6 wheat (30 Gp) for 1 Brick (30 Gp)? This is a zero sum for me.\nOr 5 Wood (55 Gp) for 2 Brick (60 Gp)? Gain of 5 Gp.\nLet's work with the highest value difference between what I offer and what I get.\nMy lowest value resource is Wheat at 5. My highest is Ore at 36.\nDifference of 31. This is the biggest spread.\nIf I can get 1 Ore for Wheat, I need to give up less than 36 value in Wheat. For example, 7 Wheat (35 Gp) for 1 Ore (36 Gp) would be a 1 Gp gain. This small gain might be rejected again.\nI need to offer a deal that I value as positive, and that Player 0 might value as positive for them.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the previous rejected offer: [Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore].\nMy value lost: 10 Wheat * 5 Gp/W = 50 Gp.\nMy value gained: 2 Ore * 36 Gp/O = 72 Gp.\nNet gain for me: +22 Gp. Player 0 rejected this.\n\nThis implies Player 0 either values *their* Ore more than my 36 Gp, or they value my Wheat less than my 5 Gp, or the 22 Gp gain for me wasn't enough incentive for them.\nGiven Player 0 immediately rejected this, it suggests the offer was not favorable *enough* for them. It might have even been a loss for them or a negligible gain. If they consider 1 Ore to be worth more than 5 Wheat, then my 10 Wheat for 2 Ore (essentially 5 Wheat per Ore) could be seen by them as a bad deal.\n\nLet's assume Player 0 values Ore as their most valuable commodity.\nWhat if I offer something else alongside Wheat?\nI have a lot of Sheep. 17 Sheep at 12 Gp/unit.\nWhat if I try to get something cheaper, like Brick, which is 30 Gp/unit.\nMy Sheep is 12 Gp/unit.\n2 Sheep (24 Gp) for 1 Brick (30 Gp)? This is a gain of 6 Gp. This seems like a reasonable trade for me.\nWould Player 0 accept this? One of their previous offers was \"5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 4 Ore\". This indicates they are willing to give away Brick and Ore if they get enough in return, including Sheep. Their offer of 5 Wood (55 Gp) + 3 Sheep (36 Gp) = 91 Gp for 2 Brick (60 Gp) + 4 Ore (144 Gp) = 204 Gp. Player 0's gain would be 113 Gp. This further reinforces they are looking for large gains.\n\nMy previous offer was 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore (50 Gp for 72 Gp). My gain was 22 Gp.\nPerhaps 22 Gp gain is not enough for *me* to offer, *if* Player 0's gain is negative or too small.\nThe market analyst pointed out Player 0 consistently wanting Brick and Ore.\n\nLet's try to offer a mix of my low-value resources for a single unit of Player 0's desired resources (Brick or Ore).\nTarget: 1 Brick (30 Gp value for me).\nOffer: 3 Wood (33 Gp) and 1 Wheat (5 Gp). Total: 38 Gp. Loss.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (25 Gp). Gain of 5 Gp. But is 5 Wheat enough for P0?\nOffer: 4 Wheat (20 Gp) and 1 Wood (11 Gp) = 31 Gp. Gain of 1 Gp. Marginally acceptable for me. Too tight.\n\nConsider this: Player 0 offered (4 Wheat + 10 Wood) -> (5 Brick + 2 Ore). My current total value from these items is 130 Gp -> 222 Gp. If I had accepted this trade, my total value would have increased by 92 Gp. I rejected it because I thought I could get a better deal for my highly valued Brick and Ore. This was perhaps a mistake given the rejections. If Player 0 is willing to lose 130 Gp (their value) to gain 222 Gp (their value), they are valuing Brick and Ore much higher.\n\nLet's try to frame an offer that seems good for *Player 0*, but is still net positive for *me*.\nIf Player 0 is giving up some resources for others, they must be at parity within their own value system. But we don't know their values. We only know ours.\nThe only certain way to increase my value is to acquire resources worth more than what I give up, using my own values.\n\nLet's assume Player 0 is primarily seeking Brick and Ore.\nMy most expendable resource is Wheat (20 units), then Sheep (17 units), then Wood (8 units).\nWhat if I offer a larger quantity of Wheat or Sheep for a smaller quantity of Brick or Ore?\n\nConsider Player 0's last rejected offer: \"5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 4 Ore\".\nMy value given: 5 Wood (55) + 3 Sheep (36) = 91 Gp.\nMy value gained: 2 Brick (60) + 4 Ore (144) = 204 Gp.\nIf I had accepted this, my gain would have been 113 Gp. This was an excellent trade for me! I rejected it. Why? Oh, I misread the previous turn.\n\nLooking back at the logs:\n\"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> Requested items: 2 Brick, 4 Ore\"\n\"Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\"\n\nWhy did I reject that? My own analysis now shows it was a significant gain for me. This means I probably misunderstood the game mechanics or miscalculated in the previous turn. This makes me realize I need to be more careful.\n\nOkay, that was a huge mistake. Given I rejected such a generous offer from Player 0, I can assume Player 0 is aggressively trying to gain Brick and Ore, and *is willing to pay a premium for them*. This changes my strategy significantly.\n\nSince Player 0 is willing to give up resources worth 91 Gp (my value) for resources worth 204 Gp (my value), it means they implicitly value 2 Brick and 4 Ore *more* than 204 Gp. This is great for me.\n\nMy offer of 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore was rejected, and my gain would have been 22 Gp. This tells me that either 10 Wheat is not enough for 2 Ore from Player 0's perspective, or even a small gain for me wasn't acceptable.\nHowever, I just realized I rejected a deal where I would have gained 113 Gp. This implies I should be looking for a deal that benefits me significantly, and I should also be more flexible.\n\nNow, knowing Player 0 is potentially over-valuing Brick and Ore, I should leverage that. I have 17 Brick and 13 Ore. I am in a strong position. I should offer some of my Brick/Ore for *even more* low-value resources, at an exchange rate that's very favorable to me.\n\nI have strong quantities of Brick and Ore. Player 0 clearly wants them.\nI should not get rid of too many of my high-value resources unless the return is spectacular.\nI have a lot of Wheat (20).\n\nNew strategy: I should offer a *small* amount of Brick/Ore for a large amount of low-value resources from Player 0. This is the opposite of what I was doing before.\nI have too much of Wheat and Sheep. I want to convert them to more valuable resources. However, Player 0 is valuing my *high value* resources at an even higher rate. I should exploit this specific demand from Player 0 for Brick and Ore.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick for a large amount of Wheat/Wood/Sheep?\n1 Brick is 30 Gp to me.\nIf I get 5 Wood (55 Gp) and 2 Wheat (10 Gp) for 1 Brick, I gain 35 Gp. That's a good trade for me.\nThe trade would be: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 5 Wood, 2 Wheat] (giving 30 Gp, gaining 65 Gp). This implies Player 0 values 1 Brick at more than 65 Gp.\nThis is a high gain for me (35 Gp). Given P0 offered to give up 91 Gp for 204 Gp (a 113 Gp gain for them), they might find a trade where they get 1 Brick for 65 Gp appealing.\n\nLet's try this.\n\n---\n### Expert 3: Market Analyst\nMy previous analysis that Player 0 wants Brick and Ore, and is willing to pay for it, seems even more accurate given the revelation that Player 1 (me) rejected a very favorable offer by Player 0 in the last turn which would have yielded a +113 Gp gain for Player 1. This means Player 0 is desperate for Brick and Ore. We should capitalize on this. Our strategy should shift: we should *sell* our high-value Brick and Ore for highly inflated prices in terms of lower-value resources. This way, we increase total value significantly.\n\n---\n### Expert 1: Resource Strategist\nGiven the new information that Player 0 is actively making offers where they give up *much more* in my perceived value of low-cost resources for my high-cost resources, our strategy must shift. Instead of acquiring more high-cost resources, we should exploit Player 0's desperate need for Brick and Ore. We should offer a small quantity of our Brick or Ore in exchange for a large quantity of their low-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep). This allows us to convert our high-value resources into an even *higher* value of less valuable resources, significantly boosting our total portfolio value. We should target trades that yield us a substantial positive value difference, as Player 0 seems willing to make such trades for their benefit, and by extension, for ours.\n\n---\n### Expert 2: Value Maximizer\nThis new information is critical. My previous analysis of Player 0's offer revealed: P0 offered 5 Wood (55 Gp) + 3 Sheep (36 Gp) = 91 Gp. P0 requested 2 Brick (60 Gp) + 4 Ore (144 Gp) = 204 Gp. My (Player 1's) potential gain: 204 - 91 = 113 Gp. Rejecting this was a mistake.\n\nNow, knowing Player 0's willingness to \"overpay\" (from my perspective) for Brick and Ore, I should make an offer that gives Player 0 Brick or Ore, but at an extremely favorable rate for me.\n\nLet's try to sell 1 Ore (36 Gp). What would I want in return?\nTo make it appealing to Player 0, they should still perceive it as valuable.\nIf I get 10 Wheat (50 Gp) and 2 Wood (22 Gp) for 1 Ore (36 Gp).\nMy offer: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 10 Wheat, 2 Wood]\nMy value given: 1 Ore * 36 Gp/Ore = 36 Gp.\nMy value gained: (10 Wheat * 5 Gp/Wheat) + (2 Wood * 11 Gp/Wood) = 50 Gp + 22 Gp = 72 Gp.\nMy net gain: 72 Gp - 36 Gp = +36 Gp.\n\nThis is a very good direct value increase for me. Would Player 0 accept?\nPlayer 0 has previously offered 4 Wheat and 10 Wood (130 Gp) for 5 Brick and 2 Ore (222 Gp).\nMy current offer: 1 Ore for 10 Wheat and 2 Wood.\nThis means Player 0 would be giving up 10 Wheat and 2 Wood to gain 1 Ore. For them, they would be trading 12 *something* units for 1 Ore.\nIf they accepted the 1 Ore (worth 36 to me) for 10 Wheat (50) and 2 Wood (22 Gp), they would be giving up 72 Gp (my assessment) to gain 36 Gp (my assessment).\nThis means *I* assess this as a gain for me, but *Player 0* would assess this as a net *loss* of 36 Gp (my assessment of their resources).\nThis is exactly what Player 0 was willing to do (offer resources worth X for resources worth more than X), but in this case, my trade turns that on Player 0.\nThis aligns with their previous actions where they were willing to give up 130 Gp (my assessment) to get 222 Gp (my assessment), where their gain was 92 Gp.\nSo, if they valued 1 Ore at 100 Gp (Hypothetical Player 0 value) and Wheat at 5 Gp and Wood at 11 Gp, then offering 10 Wheat (50 Gp) + 2 Wood (22 Gp) = 72 Gp (my value units) for 1 Ore (100 Gp hypothetical value) would be an attractive trade for Player 0, where they gain 28 Gp (hypothetically).\n\nThis seems like a strong offer for Player 0, given their apparent need for Ore, and a very strong offer for me (+36 Gp).\n\nFinal check on resources:\nI have 13 Ore. Giving up 1 is fine.\nI have 20 Wheat and 8 Wood. Gaining 10 Wheat and 2 Wood increases my quantity of low-value items, but at a very good ratio relative to the high-value item I'm giving up. This is a net positive value increase.\n\nThis will be my new offer.\n\n```\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 10 Wheat, 2 Wood]\n```",

      "response": "Let's analyze the situation from the perspectives of three different trading experts who can provide valuable insights for your negotiation strategy in this game. \n\n### Expert 1: Resource Valuation Expert\nThis expert focuses on the value of resources and the efficiency of trades.\n\n1. **Current Resource Evaluation**: \n   - Wheat (13 units at 5 value each = 65)\n   - Wood (25 units at 12 value each = 300)\n   - Sheep (13 units at 13 value each = 169)\n   - Brick (9 units at 25 value each = 225)\n   - Ore (5 units at 34 value each = 170)\n\n   Total value: 65 + 300 + 169 + 225 + 170 = **929**\n\n2. **Trade Offer Assessment**: \n   The latest offer from Player 1 (10 Wheat for 2 Ore) offers you 68 value for 50 value. Thus, it's unfavorable. You should consider not offering 10 Wheat but look for offers that enhance your total resource value.\n\n### Expert 2: Strategic Negotiation Expert\nThis expert evaluates the strategic angle of the negotiations.\n\n1. **Current Strategies**: The previous trades have been rebuffed, indicating either an overestimation of resource value or poor negotiation tactics. You need to incorporate flexibility into your offers.\n  \n2. **Future Trade Directions**: Prioritize trades that maximize your efficient resources. For example, your Wood and Sheep are plentiful. Consider negotiating with those, especially since Brick and Ore seem to be your targets, which appear more valuable for you.\n\n### Expert 3: Psychological Insight Expert\nThis expert understands player tendencies and behaviors in negotiation settings.\n\n1. **Understanding Player 1's Rejections**: Player 1 may be trying to hoard Wheat or may have a different strategy entirely. Your repeated offers didn't entice them, indicating they might perceive your offers as undervalued.\n\n2. **Building Rapport**: Offer smaller trades to build trust over time. Perhaps a smaller quantity of Wheat or Wood in return for a mix of Brick and Ore might establish positive rapport and lead to larger trades down the line.\n\n### Next Steps for Player 0\nConsidering the insights of all three experts, here\u2019s a strategic move you can make:\n1. **Offer a Smaller Trade**: `[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]`\n   This trade involves valuable materials from your stash that you have in plenty while requesting sought-after materials in smaller quantities.\n\nBy offering a trade in smaller proportions, you may entice Player 1 to accept, helping you increase your total value further.",

      "response": "**Player 1 - Turn 7**\n\nHere are your current resources and their values:\n*   **Wheat**: Qty: 20, Value: 5 (Total Value: 100)\n*   **Wood**: Qty: 8, Value: 11 (Total Value: 88)\n*   **Sheep**: Qty: 17, Value: 12 (Total Value: 204)\n*   **Brick**: Qty: 17, Value: 30 (Total Value: 510)\n*   **Ore**: Qty: 13, Value: 36 (Total Value: 468)\n**Total Current Value: 1370**\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep -> Requested: 2 Brick, 1 Ore\n\n**Pre-computation:**\n*   **Offered (from P0) Value:** (4 * 11) + (2 * 12) = 44 + 24 = 68\n*   **Requested (from P0) Value:** (2 * 30) + (1 * 36) = 60 + 36 = 96\n*   **P0's proposed trade provides them with a gain of 96-68 = 28.** This means it would result in a **loss of 28 for Player 1**.\n\n---\n\n### Expert A: The Resource Optimizer\n**Step 1:** My primary objective is to increase total value. I need to quickly identify which resources I have in abundance and which are highly valued by me. Brick and Ore are my most valuable resources per unit. Wheat is my least valuable. I have a fair amount of Wheat, Sheep, and Brick. My Wood quantity is the lowest. I should look to trade away lower-value resources for higher-value ones, especially Brick and Ore.\n\n### Expert B: The Deal Strategist\n**Step 1:** I need to analyze the opponent's behavior. Player 0 has consistently tried to acquire high-value resources (Brick, Ore) from me, often offering lower-value resources or quantities that result in a net loss for me. Their latest offer (4 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore) is no exception; accepting it would decrease my total value by 28. This means they are likely trying to profit significantly from trades. I should not accept offers that result in a loss for me.\n\n### Expert C: The Market Psychologist\n**Step 1:** Player 0's persistence in requesting Brick and Ore, even after multiple rejections, tells me these are resources they highly value or are in dire need of. This gives me leverage. I should consider what resources I have that they might want but at a rate that is highly beneficial to me. They seem willing to overpay for Brick and Ore, which suggests I can demand more from them in exchange for these items.\n\n---\n**Player 1 Action:**\n\n[Deny]",
