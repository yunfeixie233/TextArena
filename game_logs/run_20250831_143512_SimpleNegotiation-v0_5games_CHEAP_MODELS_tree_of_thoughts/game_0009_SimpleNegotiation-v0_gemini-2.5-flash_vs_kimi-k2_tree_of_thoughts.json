      "response": "Okay, I understand. I am Player 0 and my goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I need to carefully consider the advice from three different experts, each with a unique perspective. I will ensure all my actions adhere to the specified format.\n\nHere are the resources I currently possess:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 21 (Value: 6)\n*   [Wood] Qty: 24 (Value: 9)\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 24 (Value: 18)\n*   [Brick] Qty: 17 (Value: 29)\n*   [Ore] Qty: 12 (Value: 36)\n\nMy current total value is (21*6) + (24*9) + (24*18) + (17*29) + (12*36) = 126 + 216 + 432 + 493 + 432 = 1699.\n\nI need to determine what types of experts would be most helpful. I'll pick three distinct perspectives that can offer comprehensive advice.\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer (Focus: Pure monetary gain)**\nThis expert will always prioritize trades that immediately increase my total resource value, regardless of future strategy or resource quantities. They'll be looking for the most \"profitable\" ratios.\n\n**Expert 2: The Strategic Balancer (Focus: Resource diversity and utility)**\nThis expert will consider not just immediate value, but also the overall balance of my resources. They might advise acquiring resources that are commonly demanded or that I have a low quantity of, even if the immediate monetary gain isn't immense, to improve future trading flexibility. They'll also consider high-value resources.\n\n**Expert 3: The Scarcity/Demand Forecaster (Focus: Market dynamics and future value)**\nThis expert will try to predict which resources will become more valuable or harder to acquire as the game progresses (based on general game knowledge), and advise hoarding or offloading resources accordingly. They'll also consider my current excess quantities.\n\n---\n**Turn 1**\n\n**Expert 2 (Strategic Balancer) - Step 1:**\n\"Player 0 has a good quantity of all resources, but a relatively lower count of Ore (12) compared to Wheat (21), Wood (24), Sheep (24), and even Brick (17). Ore is also one of the highest value resources. Generally, having a healthy stock of high-value resources like Ore or Brick is beneficial for future negotiations or strategic plays. We also have a lot of Sheep and Wood.\"\n\n**Expert 3 (Scarcity/Demand Forecaster) - Step 1:**\n\"Given my current resource distribution, I have a surplus of low-value resources like Wheat (21) and Wood (24), and a decent amount of Sheep (24). Brick (17) and Ore (12) are my highest value per unit resources. Other players are likely to want Ore and Brick in the mid to late game. Therefore, I should aim to acquire more of the high-value resources, especially Ore, and potentially offload some of my lower-value, high-quantity resources.\"\n\n**Expert 1 (Value Maximizer) - Step 1:**\n\"Let's calculate the current total value. With a total value of 1699, my goal is to execute trades that directly increase this number. I should look for opportunities where the value of resources I request significantly exceeds the value of resources I offer, focusing on the highest value resource I have (Ore at 36) and the highest value resource I might want (Ore or Brick). I also have a lot of Sheep (18) and Wood (9) which could be good for bundling.\"",

      "response": "We\u2019ll use three complementary expert personas whose specialties are most useful for a short-horizon value-maximizing game:\n\n1.  Maximizer \u2013 pure value-per-unit analyst (focus on total-value delta).  \n2.  Market Maker \u2013 liquidity / marginal-value balancer (focus on keeping stockpiles balanced so every remaining turn has plenty of trading leverage).  \n3.  Predictor \u2013 scenario analyst (tries to anticipate future offers and bottlenecks).\n\nEach expert presents one step of reasoning in turn, advancing every round until at least one stops (if they contradict themselves).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nRound 1 \u2013 Step 1 of 3\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nMaximizer:\nMy first step is to compare the marginal value of every resource we could give up to the marginal value of anything we could receive.  \nCurrent marginal values (value per unit) are:\n   Wheat = 6/24 = 0.25  \n   Wood  = 10/9  \u2248 1.11  \n   Sheep = 17/22 \u2248 0.77  \n   Brick = 22/25 = 0.88  \n   Ore   = 34/9  \u2248 3.78  \n\nConclusion: Brick is undervalued relative to everything except Ore.  \nAny deal where we give up the marginal\u2010low\u2010value Wheat or Sheep for additional Brick increases total value fastest.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nMarket Maker:\nMy first step is to look for \u201clumpy\u201d quantities: Brick (25) and Wheat (24) are our biggest piles. Holding the largest stock means we are least likely to hit a future bottleneck that would force a bad trade.  \nTherefore my short-term priority is to avoid shedding Brick unless we get back high-value Ore or at least high-quantity Sheep in return.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nPredictor:\nMy first step is to note the game has 10 turns total and Player 0 just passed. Player behavior in early turns skews conservative; good two-way value gains are easiest right now. The two resources that will become scarce first when turns run out are probably Ore and Wood, because their quantities are tiny (9 each) yet their unit values are very high. Thus gaining Ore/ Wood this turn maximizes upside over the remaining 9 turns.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nRound 1 \u2013 Step 2 of 3\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nMaximizer:\nBased on above, my goal is one-for-one net increase in value.  \nIf I trade away 5 Sheep (5\u00d70.77 \u2248 3.85 value) for 2 Brick (2\u00d70.88 = 1.76) I would lose 2.09 net value \u2192 reject.  \nBut giving up 3 Sheep and 1 Ore for 5 Brick?  \nLoss: (3\u00d70.77) + (1\u00d73.78) \u2248 2.31 + 3.78 = 6.09  \nGain: 5\u00d70.88 = 4.4 \u2192 net loss 1.69 \u2192 reject.  \nTherefore I should target **getting Ore or Wood**, not Brick, because any offer we make **must** beat 3.78 marginal if we give up Ore.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nMarket Maker (agrees & refines):\nWe have exactly 9 Wood which is at a premium. I cannot safely trade Wood away.  \nThe only positive-sum offer I can construct is:  \ngive some **Sheep** and **Wheat** (our weakest value piles), ask for **Ore**.  \nOne reasonable balance:  \n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore, 3 Brick] \u2013 that preserves our Wood and Brick positions while injecting high-value Ore and extra Brick we can buffer later.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nPredictor:\nThat offer would leave us still vulnerable on Wood next turn. Instead, because future trades depend on both stocks and opponent desires, we should be a bit bolder and ask for **both Wood and Ore**, offering higher quantities but of the low-value items. A simple, symmetric line:\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 2 Wood, 1 Ore]\n\nThat leaves us with enough Sheep for bargaining later, converts two low-value piles into highest-value ones, and increases total expected value.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal consensus:\nThe Predictor\u2019s proposal yields a better balanced portfolio for the remaining 9 turns. We have large remaining stacks of Sheep/Brick and newly injected high-value Wood/Ore.\n\nAction taken:\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 2 Wood, 1 Ore]",

I\u2019ll post an asking-offer that dumps the two \u201cworst\u201d cards and hoards the \u201cbest\u201d.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood \u2192 3 Brick]  \nThis would swap 3\u00b76 + 2\u00b710 = 38 points for 3\u00b722 = 66 points, a net gain of +28 points while still keeping 21 Wheat and 7 Wood (quantities above the guru\u2019s comfort zone of 5+).\n\n**Margin-Maximizer (Expert B):**  \nNice, +28 profit. But I\u2019d like to push it further. If possible I\u2019d rather gain 3\u00d7 Ore instead of Brick, because 3\u00b734 = 102 > 66. However I know the other player may balk\u2014Ore is king. So I\u2019ll try a milder ask for one Ore and two Brick, still squeezing value.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore, 2 Brick]  \nDelta = (34 + 2\u00b722) \u2013 (17\u00b72 + 10) = 78 \u2013 44 = 34 profit. Still keeps every stock safely above 10.\n\n**Quantity-Driver (Expert C):**  \nBoth your proposals cut into Wheat & Wood counts. I\u2019m defensive: I insist that after any trade no resource of mine drops below 8 units. My scanning says there is exactly one combination that gives points AND keeps all minimums: Swap 3 Wheat & 2 Sheep for 3 Brick.  \nNew counts: 21 Wheat, 9 Wood, 20 Sheep, 28 Brick, 9 Ore \u2013 every \u2265 9, and the delta is (+66)-(18+34)=14 surplus. Small but zero haircut risk.\n\n\u2014\u2014 ROUND-2 CHECK \u2014\u2014\n\nAfter the three have seen each other\u2019s initial ideas, silent consensus forms:  \nGuru accepts that Margin-Maximizer\u2019s version beats his own (+34 > +28) and both agree with Driver that none of the stocks should dip below 8.
