Ore has the highest value per quantity (38), followed by Brick (21), Sheep (13), Wood (11), and Wheat (6).\n- Step 1: Given that I have a large quantity of Ore and Brick, I should look for trading opportunities that involve these high-value resources to maximize my total value.\n\n**Expert 2: Demand and Supply Expert**  \n- Current Analysis: I will analyze the likely demands of other players. Brick and Ore are generally in demand for construction and upgrades. Wheat and Wood are comparatively lower in value and may not appeal as much to other players.\n- Step 1: Therefore, I want to leverage my bulk of lesser-valued resources to offer for these high-demand items, specifically focusing on Brick or Ore in trades. \n\n**Expert 3: Risk Assessment Expert**  \n- Current Analysis: Trading carries risks if the value of my current resources exceeds what I might gain from a trade. I need to compute possible trades that retain or increase my total resource value while minimizing my risk of loss.\n- Step 1: Analyzing my resources, any trade that lowers my high-value items (like Ore or Brick) should be considered carefully, ensuring I increase my total value.\n\n### Next Step\nAssuming the trading phase allows for offers, I suggest a trade offer based on the findings of these experts: I want to trade lower-value resources to acquire higher-value resources while keeping my highest-value items intact.\n\n**Proposed Offer**  \n- [Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]  \nThis keeps high-value resources in my possession and enhances my stockpile of Brick, which can lead to further trades.\n\n### Conclusion\nI'll be ready to either accept or decline offers based on further discussions among the experts and any offers from the other players. If I determine that the benefits of the trade exceed the values of my current resources after feedback, I will proceed to `[Accept]`. If not, I will maintain my stance with `[Deny]`.",

Looking at the proposed trade, I would be losing 5 Wheat (a relatively low-value item) and gaining 3 Brick (a high-value item). While this is good for overall value, I only have 9 Wheat. Losing almost half of it might make me vulnerable if Wheat is needed for future actions or if its value increases.\"\n*   **Value Maximizer:** \"Let's calculate the value. Losing 5 Wheat is a loss of 5 * 6 = 30 value. Gaining 3 Brick is a gain of 3 * 29 = 87 value. The net gain is 87 - 30 = 57 value. This is a clear increase in total value, which aligns with my objective. From a pure value perspective, this trade is favorable.\"\n*   **Strategic Thinker:** \"Player 0 is offering Wheat, our lowest value resource, for Brick, one of our highest. This signals that Player 0 might be in need of Wheat or trying to acquire high-value resources. Accepting this trade could signal our willingness to part with Wheat for Brick, which might lead to future less favorable offers for our high-value items. However, if Player 0 truly needs Wheat, this could be an opportunity to offload excess low-value items. We currently have a decent quantity of Brick, so parting with 3 is not crippling.\"\n\n---\n**Turn 2**\n\n*   **Resource Manager:** \"Revisiting my concern about Wheat quantity: while 9 isn't a huge amount, we still have 4 remaining after the trade. Given the high value of Brick, this seems like a reasonable exchange to increase our high-value stock. It doesn't put us in a critically low state for any resource.\"\n*   **Value Maximizer:** \"The value calculation remains solid. A gain of 57 is substantial. We have no information to suggest the value of Wheat will suddenly skyrocket, nor that Brick will plummet. This trade significantly boosts our overall worth.\"\n*   **Strategic Thinker:** \"Given Player 0's previous successful trade with us (3 Sheep, 2 Ore for 5 Brick, 2 Sheep yielded us a net gain of 3*29 - 3*13 - 2*32 = 87 - 39 - 64 = -16, wait, no, the opposite, 5 Brick + 2 Sheep we received was 5*29 + 2*13 = 145 + 26 = 171. We gave 3 Sheep + 2 Ore which was 3*13 + 2*32 = 39 + 64 = 103. Net gain of 171 - 103 = 68. Player 0 seems to be making advantageous trades for them, but this one is clearly advantageous for us. They likely have a surplus of Wheat or need Brick more than we realize. Accepting this trade reinforces the idea that we are willing to trade Wheat, which could be useful for us later to offload more if needed. It's a good immediate gain.\"\n\n---\n**Turn 3**\n\n*   **Resource Manager:** \"I agree that the trade maintains acceptable resource quantities given the significant value increase. The potential loss of flexibility with Wheat is outweighed by the gain in valuable Brick.\"\n*   **Value Maximizer:** \"Absolutely, the numbers speak for themselves. This is a move that directly increases our wealth. We should accept.\"\n*   **Strategic Thinker:** \"This player is effectively giving us a good deal, perhaps to build goodwill or because their internal resource valuation is different. It's an excellent opportunity to reinforce our inventory of a high-value resource. There's no apparent downside that would override the immediate value gain.\"\n\n**Decision:** All experts agree.

Player 0 is offering 5 Sheep and 2 Wheat. My current value for 5 Sheep is 5 * 13 = 65, and for 2 Wheat is 2 * 6 = 12. So, the total value I would receive is 65 + 12 = 77. In return, Player 0 is asking for 4 Brick. My current value for 4 Brick is 4 * 29 = 116. Since 77 is less than 116, this trade would decrease my total resource value. I would not accept this offer.\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Manager**\nI agree with the Value Maximizer's assessment of current values. However, I also need to consider my current inventory. I have 20 Sheep and 9 Wheat, so giving away 5 Sheep and 2 Wheat is feasible in terms of quantity. I also have 22 Brick, so giving away 4 Brick is also feasible. The issue isn't stock, but the unfavorable exchange rate in terms of value. I have a lot of Brick, and while it's valuable, I don't want to trade it away for less than its worth.\n\n**Expert 3: The Strategic Forecaster**\nWhile I agree that this specific trade isn't good on its own terms, I'm thinking about the bigger picture. I have a lot of Sheep and Wood, which are generally lower value. My Brick is quite valuable, and Ore is even more so. I want to accumulate more high-value resources and reduce my surplus of lower-value ones, but only if the exchange is favorable. This offer isn't moving me in the right direction strategically. I'm giving up a high-value resource for lower-value ones, and at an unfavorable rate to boot. We are already at Turn 6.

Here\u2019s the breakdown of your resources:\n\n- Wheat: 24 qty * 6 value = 144\n- Wood: 20 qty * 11 value = 220\n- Sheep: 23 qty * 13 value = 299\n- Brick: 13 qty * 21 value = 273\n- Ore: 13 qty * 38 value = 494\n\n**Current Total Value:** 144 + 220 + 299 + 273 + 494 = 1430\n\nThe most valuable resource is Ore, followed by Sheep. I should focus on trades that allow me to gain more high-value resources like Brick or potentially more Ore since they have the highest value.\n\n### Expert 2: The Market Analyst\n**Step 2 Analysis**  \nLooking at your previous offers, we see that Player 1 is not willing to trade their resources easily. Thus, we should aim for alternate trades that may yield better value or involve different players if available. \n\n**Proposed Offer Going Forward:**  \nConsider offering the same resources but seeking a different combination that could entice Player 1 or another player (if they exist). For example:  \n'[Offer: 4 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 5 Brick, 2 Wood]' could yield better results.\n\n### Expert 3: The Strategic Blocker\n**Step 3 Analysis**  \nTo increase my total value, I must ensure I am not giving away key resources too easily. The last couple of offers have shown Player 1's reluctance to trade. Therefore, I will reconsider my strategy by holding onto more valuable resources and offering a mix of quantities instead of focusing heavily on one or two items.\n\n**Action Plan:**  \n- Hold onto higher value resources (Ore and Sheep).\n- Offer lesser valued items alongside some quantity of a more valuable resource to make offers appear more enticing.\n\n### Next Steps\nWith the insights from each expert:\n\n- **Resource Maximizer's Proposal:** Increase the offer's value by focusing on a combination of lower value resources while enhancing the number of Brick or seeking resources like Wood which have a good trade value.\n- **Market Analyst\u2019s Approach:** Continue to negotiate but shift the offers strategically, considering overall utility and immediate resources you wish to gain.\n- **Strategic Blocker\u2019s Recommendation:** Consider holding off on offering too many high-value items and focus on trades that maximize your acquired value while maintaining leverage over valuable resources.\n\nTaking into account these expert analyses, I will make a new offer to Player 1:\n\n**New Offer:**  \n'[Offer: 4 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 5 Brick, 2 Wood]' \n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds to this trade suggestion.",

Focus on trades that bring in resources with high per-unit value.*\n\n#### Thought Process:\n1.  **Analyze current offer:** Player 0 offers `4 Sheep (value 4*13=52), 3 Wheat (value 3*6=18)` for `5 Brick (value 5*29=145), 2 Wood (value 2*8=16)`.\n    *   Total offered value = 52 + 18 = 70.\n    *   Total requested value = 145 + 16 = 161.\n    *   This is a significant loss of 161 - 70 = 91 in value.\n2.  **Evaluate resource types:** The requested resources, Brick and Wood, are currently my 2nd and 4th most valuable single units. Sheep is mid-value, Wheat is low-value.\n3.  **Consider my current holdings:** I have a good amount of Wood (23) and Sheep (20). I have a decent amount of Brick (22) and Ore (10). Wheat is my lowest quantity (9).\n4.  **Strategic Resource Acquisition:** While Brick is valuable, giving up 5 of them plus 2 Wood (which I have plenty of) for lower value Sheep and Wheat is counterproductive if I want to maximize per-unit value. I aim to acquire more Ore and Brick, not give them up.\n\n---\n### Expert 2: The Value Optimizer\n*Goal: Only accept trades that result in a net increase in total resource value. Calculate the exact value change for every potential trade.*\n\n#### Thought Process:\n1.  **Calculate current offer's value exchange:**\n    *   Value of resources Player 0 offers me: `(4 * 13 (Sheep)) + (3 * 6 (Wheat)) = 52 + 18 = 70`.\n    *   Value of resources Player 0 requests from me: `(5 * 29 (Brick)) + (2 * 8 (Wood)) = 145 + 16 = 161`.\n2.  **Determine net value change:** `Value received - Value given = 70 - 161 = -91`.\n3.  **Decision based on value change:** A negative value change means I would lose total value. My primary goal is to increase my total value. Therefore, this offer should be rejected.\n\n---\n### Expert 3: The Market Strategist\n*Goal: Understand the opponent's needs and current market conditions. Formulate counter-offers that exploit known imbalances or seek to gain highly valuable resources in exchange for less critical ones.*\n\n#### Thought Process:\n1.  **Analyze Player 0's previous offers and current offer:** Player 0 has consistently tried to acquire Brick. This suggests Brick is highly valuable to them. Their willingness to offer 5 Wheat or 5 Sheep and 2 Wheat indicates they might be resource-rich in these lower-value items, or desperate for Brick.\n2.  **Assess my own needs:** My highest value resources per unit are Ore (32) and Brick (29). I have a good quantity of Brick. I also have plenty of Wood and Sheep. My lowest quantity is Wheat (9).\n3.  **Evaluate the current offer regarding market strategy:** This offer is terrible from a strategic standpoint as it gives up high-value Brick for low-value Sheep and Wheat. Accepting this would deplete my valuable Brick and Wood for resources I already have in good supply or are less valuable.\n4.  **Formulate a counter-strategy (for later, if rejected):** Since Player 0 seems keen on Brick, I should leverage that. I could propose giving Wood and/or Sheep (which I have in abundance) for high-value Ore or even more Brick if the ratio is favorable. I also want to hold onto my Ore as it's the most valuable.\n\n---\n**Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 4 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> Requested items: 5 Brick, 2 Wood**\n\n**Expert 1: The Resource Maximizer**\nThis offer asks for 5 Brick (my second most valuable resource/unit) and 2 Wood (which I have plenty of). In return, I get 4 Sheep and 3 Wheat, which are lower value resources. This trade reduces my quantity of high-value items and increases my quantity of low-value items. It contradicts my goal of maximizing value per unit.\n\n**Expert 2: The Value Optimizer**\nCalculations show a `Value received (70) - Value given (161) = -91`. This trade results in a significant decrease in my total resource value. I must reject any trade that reduces my overall value.\n\n**Expert 3: The Market Strategist**\nPlayer 0 is still trying to get Brick. This offer, however, is extremely unfavorable to me. Giving up 5 Brick and 2 Wood for just 4 Sheep and 3 Wheat is a poor strategic move. It weakens my high-value holdings significantly without offering anything of comparable strategic value. This clearly indicates Player 0 is trying to exploit my resources. I should not accept this.\n\n**Consensus:** All experts agree this offer is detrimental.\n\n[Deny]",

Player 1 has rejected multiple offers, indicating either a high valuation of their resources or low interest in what I currently have. Player 1 may be seeking trades that fit their own strategy, possibly looking for more Sheep or Ore. It may be useful to pivot my approach and offer a combination that reflects their resources.\n\n**Next Move:** I suggest offering a trade of 3 Sheep and 2 Ore for 4 Brick, anticipating Player 1 might need to offload Brick for a balanced resource pool. \n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: The Risk Assessment Specialist**  \n*Focus: Evaluating the risk vs. reward for every trading decision.*  \n**Analysis:** I note that some trades have already been rejected, indicating potential overestimation of my own resources or undervaluation of theirs. Careful attention to what has already been turned down is crucial to avoid unnecessary losses. Leveraging the fact that I have ample Sheep and Wheat, I could offer smaller quantities in new proposals to mitigate risk of rejection.\n\n**Next Move:** Propose a straightforward offer of 3 Sheep for 2 Brick.

Wheat is the lowest value resource I possess (6), while Brick is a high-value resource (29). Trading a low-value resource for a high-value resource is generally favorable, especially when the total value gain is significant. We have 9 Wheat, so giving away 4 still leaves us with 5. We also have 22 Brick, acquiring 3 more would bring us to 25. This trade significantly boosts our high-value resource stock.\"\n\n**The Opportunist (Step 1):**\n\"Previously, Player 0 offered 5 Wheat for 3 Brick, which I rejected (my mistake!). Now they're offering 4 Wheat for 3 Brick. This signals that Player 0 might be in need of Wheat or trying to acquire more Brick, and they are willing to give me a better deal for Brick. This new offer is even more favorable for me as I give up less of my very low-value Wheat. Given my past rejections, accepting this might signal a willingness to trade, which could lead to more favorable offers from Player 0.\"",

This indicates they may be holding out for more favorable trades.\n  \n- _Offer Preparation_:\n  - I recommend adjusting the strategy to appeal to Player 1's likely preferences. Try to maintain a balanced value trade:\n  - **[Offer: 3 Sheep, 4 Wheat -> 5 Brick]**\n  - This offer exchanges readily available but lower-value resources for valuable Brick, which seems to be a trading target for Players.\n\n### Aggressive Trader's Insight\n- _Analysis_:\n  - The continuous rejections suggest that Player 1 is valuing their resources highly and could be persuaded with a more assertive approach. We need to shake things up.\n  \n- _Offer Preparation_: \n  - I propose a more daring approach focusing on the highest-value resources to demonstrate confidence:\n  - **[Offer: 4 Ore, 2 Wheat -> 6 Brick]**\n  - This offer showcases significant resources and aims at acquiring a larger quantity of Brick, positioning the negotiation in a stronger light.\n\n### Next Steps\nAll experts are ready with their offers. Each expert should wait for Player 1 to respond. If there are rejections again, we may need to adjust trade resources further or possibly gauge Player 1's interests through observation of what resources they maintain as untraded.\n\n### Summary of Expert Recommendations\n1.
