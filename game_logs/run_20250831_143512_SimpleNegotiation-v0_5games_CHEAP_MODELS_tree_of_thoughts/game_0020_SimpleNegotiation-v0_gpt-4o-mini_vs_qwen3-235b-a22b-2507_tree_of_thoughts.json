      "response": "In this Negotiation Game, I will analyze the situation with insights from three different types of trading experts: \n\n1. **Market Analyst Expert** - Focuses on current market demand and supply.\n2. **Resource Management Expert** - Evaluates resource efficiency and maximum potential gains.\n3. **Risk Assessment Expert** - Considers potential risks and trade-offs of each trading decision.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: Market Analyst Expert**  \n*Step 1 Focus*: The market currently values resources differently. I observe that Wheat and Wood have lower value than Ore and Brick. To improve total resource value, I need to trade less valuable resources for more valuable ones. Trading Ore or Brick, which have high value, could yield better returns.\n\n*Suggestion*: I recommend offering some Ore and Brick to obtain resources that are more valuable relative to their current trading potential.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: Resource Management Expert**  \n*Step 1 Focus*: Efficient resource management will allow for optimal growth. I see that Brick is a fundamental resource with high value and high quantity. However, Ore has a great conversion potential due to its high value and low quantity relative to total. \n\n*Suggestion*: Perhaps I can consider trading some Wheat as it is the least valuable and less useful in larger quantities, while obtaining Ore or more Brick can bolster my resources significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: Risk Assessment Expert**  \n*Step 1 Focus*: Every trade comes with risks. I need to ensure I maintain a balanced resource pool to avoid being cornered or disadvantaged in future trades. Overtrading valuable resources could expose me to shortages in the future.\n\n*Suggestion*: I recommend only moderate trades to avoid depleting my valuable resources, such as Ore. Trading sufficient but lower-value resources like Wheat or Sheep could offset potential risks while maximizing total value.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps**  \nAfter the initial analyses, I will take a combined approach based on all experts' suggestions. I will consider the more reputable trades that involve exchanging lower-value resources for higher-value ones while being mindful of the risks involved. \n\n**Proposed Trade**  \nBased on the analyses, I would like to make an initial offer considering the advice of all experts.\n\n*Offer*:\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 5 Brick]\n\nThis trade aims to offload some lesser-valued resources (Wheat and Sheep) to gain high-value resources (Ore and Brick) while keeping sufficient quantities for future trades.\n\nWhat will the other players' responses be?",

      "response": "[Thought] Expert 1 (Resource Value Strategist): I specialize in maximizing value based on per-unit resource value. Let's evaluate the current trade value. The offered resources are 4 Wheat (value 6) and 3 Sheep (value 17), totaling: (4\u00d76) + (3\u00d717) = 24 + 51 = 75. The requested resources are 2 Ore (value 34) and 5 Brick (value 30), totaling: (2\u00d734) + (5\u00d730) = 68 + 150 = 218. This means Player 1 would give up 218 value to gain only 75 \u2014 a net loss of 143. This offer is highly unfavorable.\n\n[Thought] Expert 2 (Supply & Scarcity Analyst): I focus on inventory levels and opportunity cost. Player 1 has high Ore (24) and Brick (19) \u2014 both high-value but somewhat abundant. Losing 2 Ore and 5 Brick would leave 22 Ore and 14 Brick \u2014 still substantial. However, Wheat (24) and Sheep (16) are offered *to* us \u2014 we\u2019d gain 4 Wheat (boosting to 28) and 3 Sheep (to 19), which are useful. But the trade gives away more high-value items than it receives. Even if our stocks are high, the value disparity is too great. Caution advised.\n\n[Thought] Expert 3 (Negotiation Psychologist): I analyze intent and potential hidden motives. Player 0 is offering low-value resources (Wheat and Sheep, though Sheep are mid-tier) to extract high-value Brick and Ore. This suggests Player 0 may be trying to fuel a high-value build (e.g., city or development). They might be desperate. However, the offer is so skewed that accepting it would make Player 1 appear naive, potentially inviting worse exploitation. We should deny but consider making a counteroffer to test intentions.\n\n[Thought] Expert 1: Since the net value loss is extreme, I recommend rejecting the offer outright unless modified. My analysis holds \u2014 no rational trade gives away high-value resources for much lower.\n\n[Thought] Expert 2: While I noted we have surplus Brick and Ore, giving away 5 Brick is significant \u2014 that's over 25% of our supply. And Ore is the highest value per unit. We should preserve stock for better trades or future plays. I agree it should not be accepted as-is.\n\n[Thought] Expert 3: Player 0 might be probing for soft targets. We should deny but signal we're open to fair deals \u2014 this could lead to better offers later. A strategic denial with a counteroffer may position us as strong but cooperative.\n\n[Deny]",

Since I noted that Player 1 did not come back with a counteroffer, it might mean Player 1 is holding onto resources that might not be beneficial for us or was looking for a more favorable offer.\n\nMy recommendation is to reconsider what resources Player 0 actually needs at the moment. Potential targets could be to trade for more Ore or Brick as these will elevate Player 0's resource profile. An alternative strategy would be to hoard the high-value resources and only trade the lower-value commodities.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: The Negotiation Specialist**\n\nStep 3: I\u2019ll focus on how to frame future offers to maximize acceptance probability.\n\nSince Player 1 has already rejected an offer, I must recalibrate my approach. This is a game of not only resources but perceptions and advantages. \n\nA successful negotiation often hinges on demonstrating potential mutual benefit. Therefore, I recommend the following offer for Player 1:\n\n- **New Offer**: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 3 Ore, 4 Brick]\n\nIn this proposal, I am offering a substantial amount of Wheat (which they may find less valuable) while hoping to pull in higher-value resources (Ore and Brick). I\u2019ll highlight how obtaining a larger quantity of Wood and Wheat can help them diversify their stock as well.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps**: Player 0 will consider submitting the new trade offer based on collective insights from the experts. \n\n**Collective Final Recommendation**: \n\nPlayer 0 suggests a new offer based on the insights shared:\n\n**Offer to Player 1**: \n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 3 Ore, 4 Brick]\n\nI will then wait for the feedback from Player 1.",

      "response": "[Expert A: Resource Valuation Specialist]  \nStep 1: I analyze resource values from a scarcity and point-per-unit perspective.  \nCurrent personal resource value breakdown:  \n- Wheat: 24 \u00d7 6 = 144  \n- Wood: 18 \u00d7 12 = 216  \n- Sheep: 16 \u00d7 17 = 272  \n- Brick: 19 \u00d7 30 = 570  \n- Ore: 24 \u00d7 34 = 816  \nTotal current value: 2,018  \n\nOre and Brick are my highest-value resources. Giving them away must yield strong returns. Wheat and Wood are lowest in value per unit \u2014 potential trade commodities if surplus.\n\n[Expert B: Negotiation Strategist]  \nStep 1: I assess the opponent's pattern and intent.  \nPlayer 0's first offer: wants 2 Ore, 5 Brick (high-value) for 4 Wheat, 3 Sheep (lower-value return). Clearly trying to exploit \u2014 poor deal for me. I support Player 1\u2019s rejection.  \nSecond offer: gives 5 Wheat, 3 Wood \u2192 wants 3 Ore, 4 Brick. Still attempting to acquire high-value resources cheaply. The incoming offer undervalues what they\u2019re giving.  \nThey may be resource-poor in Ore/Brick but rich in basic materials. I suspect they\u2019re building toward high-cost developments. Need to counter with favorable terms.\n\n[Expert C: Opportunity Cost Analyst]  \nStep 1: I evaluate trades based on opportunity cost and development potential.  \nSheep and Wheat likely used for low-tier upgrades; Brick and Ore for high-tier (cities, development cards).  \nI currently have 24 Ore \u2014 among the highest quantity. Could be strategic to trade surplus Ore if acquiring undervalued returns. But must conserve Brick \u2014 only 19, and value is 30/unit.  \nPlayer 0 wants 4\u20135 Brick per offer \u2014 too steep. However, if we can trade excess Ore (24) for underpriced high-value returns, we should.\n\n[Expert A: Resource Valuation Specialist]  \nStep 2: Recalculate value efficiency.  \nOre value: 34/unit \u2014 giving it away requires premium returns.  \nBrick: 30/unit \u2014 close to Ore, so trading 1:1 is near-even, but only if gaining flexibility.  \nSheep (17) is half the value of Ore \u2014 so trading 1 Ore should yield \u22652 Sheep or equivalent.  \nPlayer 0's second offer:  \n- They give: 5 Wheat (5\u00d76=30), 3 Wood (3\u00d712=36) \u2192 total incoming: 66  \n- I give: 3 Ore (3\u00d734=102), 4 Brick (4\u00d730=120) \u2192 total out: 222  \nNet loss: 156 value units. Highly unfavorable. Deny.\n\n[Expert B: Negotiation Strategist]  \nStep 2: Craft a counter-offer that flips the imbalance.  \nSince Player 0 wants Ore and Brick, but is offering low-tier resources, I should propose a reversal:  \nUse their desire to offload Wheat and Wood to my advantage.  \nI have surplus Wheat (24) \u2014 can use as bait. Also have 18 Wood \u2014 could trade excess.  \nBut must extract value.  \nIdea: Offer minimal high-tier resources, acquire underpriced Ore.\n\n[Expert C: Opportunity Cost Analyst]  \nStep 2: Consider development path.  \nDo I need all 24 Ore? Possibly not \u2014 unless building multiple cities.  \nBut Brick at 19 is borderline \u2014 could go low if not careful.  \nOre surplus is my best trade lever.  \nIdeal trade: Exchange Ore for Brick or Sheep at favorable rate \u2014 e.g., get more Sheep (17 value) to complement city-building.\n\n[Expert A: Resource Valuation Specialist]  \nStep 3: Identify optimal trade ratio.  \nTo break even when trading 1 Ore (34), I need:  \n- \u22652 Sheep (34), or  \n- \u22656 Wheat (36), or  \n- \u22653 Wood (36), or combinations.  \nSimilarly, 1 Brick (30) needs \u22655 Wheat (30) or 2 Sheep + 1 Wheat (34), etc.  \nPlayer 0\u2019s offers fall far below this.\n\n[Expert B: Negotiation Strategist]  \nStep 3: Leverage their need.  \nThey\u2019ve made two consecutive offers wanting Ore/Brick \u2014 they\u2019re committed.  \nNow, counter with a controlled offer that feeds their need but flips value.  \nPropose: Offer 2 Brick, 4 Wheat \u2192 Request 3 Ore, 1 Sheep  \nLet\u2019s value it:  \n- I give: 2\u00d730 + 4\u00d76 = 60 + 24 = 84  \n- I get: 3\u00d734 + 1\u00d717 = 102 + 17 = 119  \nNet gain: +35 \u2014 favorable.  \nAlso reduces surplus Wheat, gains high-value Ore and Sheep.\n\n[Expert C: Opportunity Cost Analyst]  \nStep 3: Evaluate long-term utility.  \nGaining 3 Ore may seem redundant, but if Player 0 is low on Ore, this trade could disrupt their plans while boosting mine.  \nAlso, increasing Sheep (currently 16) supports future balanced trading or development.  \nCurrent offer under consideration: gives 2 Brick \u2014 acceptable since 19 is above average. 4 Wheat is negligible.  \nGains 3 Ore \u2014 brings total to 27, maximizing flexibility.  \nYes \u2014 this trade increases total value and strengthens position.\n\n[Expert A: Resource Valuation Specialist]  \nStep 4: Final validation.  \nCurrent total value: 2,018  \nAfter proposed trade:  \n- Lose: 4 Wheat, 2 Brick \u2192 -4\u00d76 -2\u00d730 = -24 -60 = -84  \n- Gain: 3 Ore, 1 Sheep \u2192 +3\u00d734 +1\u00d717 = 102 + 17 = +119  \nNew total: 2,018 -84 +119 = 2,053 \u2192 +35  \nValue-increasing.

      "response": "[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 1: My focus is on maximizing total value based on current resource values. I calculate the value of each resource: Wheat (6), Wood (12), Sheep (17), Brick (30), Ore (34). Ore and Brick are the highest-value resources, so acquiring them should be prioritized\u2014especially Ore at 34. However, we must also avoid giving up high-value resources unless we gain more in return.  \n\n[Expert 2: Trade Dynamics Analyst]  \nStep 1: I analyze the trading patterns and counterparty behavior. Player 0 has made three offers, all requesting Ore and Brick\u2014indicating high demand for these resources. They\u2019re willing to offer Wheat, Wood, and Sheep in exchange. Player 0 appears to be low on Ore and Brick. Our previous offer (4 Wheat, 2 Brick for 3 Ore, 1 Sheep) was rejected, suggesting Player 0 may not want to give up Sheep easily or wants more value in return.  \n\n[Expert 3: Risk & Opportunity Evaluator]  \nStep 1: I assess opportunity cost and inventory risks. We currently hold 24 Ore (valued at 34 each)\u2014the highest per-unit value. Giving away Ore should only be done if we gain disproportionate value. Conversely, we have 24 Wheat (lowest value), so offering Wheat is low-risk. Brick (30) is also high-value, so offering Brick must be done carefully. Our Sheep (16) and Wood (18) are moderate; we can use them as trade leverage if needed.  \n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 2: Let's quantify recent offers. Player 0\u2019s latest offer: gives 2 Wheat (2\u00d76=12), 1 Sheep (1\u00d717=17) \u2192 total incoming value: 29. Requests 2 Ore (2\u00d734=68), 3 Brick (3\u00d730=90) \u2192 total outgoing value: 158. This offer benefits Player 0 far more\u2014we lose 158 value to gain only 29. Clearly unfavorable. Rejecting was correct.  \n\n[Expert 2: Trade Dynamics Analyst]  \nStep 2: Player 0 keeps requesting Ore and Brick but offering low-to-mid value resources. Their persistence suggests scarcity. Our last offer gave 4 Wheat (24) and 2 Brick (60), total 84 cost, for 3 Ore (102) and 1 Sheep (17), net gain of +35 value. That was favorable for us\u2014but rejected. Player 0 may be seeking better terms or hoarding Sheep. We might need to adjust slightly to incentivize acceptance, without flipping the value imbalance.  \n\n[Expert 3: Risk & Opportunity Evaluator]  \nStep 2: We have surplus Wheat (24) and moderate Brick (19), but Ore (24) is both high-value and high-quantity. We could afford to trade *some* Ore if we gain net value, but must avoid letting Player 0 get too strong. However, if we don\u2019t trade, we miss growth. Opportunity cost of inaction: stagnation. Risk of over-offering: empowering opponent. Balance needed.  \n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 3: Optimal trade should have positive net value gain. Consider offering low-value goods (Wheat, maybe Wood) to acquire high-value ones (Ore). But Player 0 wants Ore, not to give it. So we must pivot: can we get Ore from Player 0 by offering Wheat and Sheep? Player 0 has accepted nothing so far, so we may need to sweeten offers slightly.  \n\n[Expert 2: Trade Dynamics Analyst]  \nStep 3: Player 0 is consistently offering Wheat and Wood\u2014likely surplus for them. They want Ore and Brick. We must reverse-engineer a deal they'll accept: perhaps offer Wheat + Brick, but request Ore + Sheep? We tried that. Maybe reduce Brick ask or increase Wheat offer to make it palatable.  \n\n[Expert 3: Risk & Opportunity Evaluator]  \nStep 3: Current total asset value:  \n(24\u00d76) + (18\u00d712) + (16\u00d717) + (19\u00d730) + (24\u00d734) = 144 + 216 + 272 + 570 + 816 = **2,018**  \nEven small positive trades can compound. A +50 value gain per turn is ideal. But with only 7 turns left, we need efficient trades. Best path: trade excess Wheat for high-value Ore. But must avoid giving too much Brick.  \n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 4: Best next move: Offer a bundle where we gain net positive value *and* Player 0 feels they are getting something desirable. Try: Offer 5 Wheat (30), 1 Brick (30) \u2192 Request 2 Ore (68). Net gain: +8. Low risk. Player 0 gets Brick, which they clearly want.  \n\n[Expert 2: Trade Dynamics Analyst]  \nStep 4: Player 0 has accepted no offers, so we must consider their threshold. They rejected our earlier offer with 2 Brick for 3 Ore \u2014 perhaps they want less Ore outflow. So flip: offer more Wheat, take fewer Ore. Alternatively, add Sheep to make it attractive. Option: Offer 5 Wheat, 1 Sheep \u2192 Request 2 Ore. Value: we give 30+17=47, get 68. Net +21. Strong.  \n\n[Expert 3: Risk & Opportunity Evaluator]  \nStep 4: 5 Wheat is low cost (value 30), 1 Sheep is 17\u2014total 47. Losing 1 Sheep is fine, we have 16. Gaining 2 Ore (68) is excellent. Risk: Player 0 might counter or reject. But we\u2019ve tried conservative offers\u2014they want more. This offer is fair but favorable to us. Worth trying.  \n\n[Expert 1, 2, 3]: Consensus reached.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "To maximize the total value from trades in the Negotiation Game, I will engage three experts to analyze the situation from different perspectives: a Resource Valuation Expert, a Negotiation Strategy Expert, and a Market Dynamics Expert.\n\n### Expert 1: Resource Valuation Expert\n1. **Assessment of Current Resources**: \n   - Wheat (Qty: 17, Value: 6)\n   - Wood (Qty: 15, Value: 11)\n   - Sheep (Qty: 8, Value: 17)\n   - Brick (Qty: 21, Value: 22)\n   - Ore (Qty: 8, Value: 34)\n   \n   I compare the values of my resources to see which ones potentially yield the highest return in trade. Currently, Ore has the highest value per unit. I will prioritize trades that increase my Ore and Brick, as they hold more value.\n\n2. **Possible High-Value Trades**: I notice Player 1 has rejected multiple offers. They might need Wheat or Sheep. Offering surplus Wheat could unlock better trades for Ore or Brick but should also assess what Player 1 is trading for.\n\n### Expert 2: Negotiation Strategy Expert\n1. **Evaluation of Trading Dynamics**: Since Player 1 rejected multiple offers, I need to find an appealing offer to provide to them. With their last offer consisting of Wheat and Brick in exchange for Ore, I will adjust my strategy to a more favorable offer for them to seal a deal.\n\n2. **Proposing a Compromise Offer**: Given their interest in Ore, I could propose a deal that maintains their need but provides me a fair exchange. \n\n   Suggested Offer: \n   - **[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 3 Brick]**  \n   This trades a good number of my surplus Wheat while ensuring I still get high-value resources in return.\n\n### Expert 3: Market Dynamics Expert\n1. **Market Trends and Potential Response**: Observing Player 1\u2019s refusal of previous offers, I should consider the resource supply on the market. If there\u2019s a high supply of Ore among other players, the demand for it might be lower, influencing Player 1\u2019s responses.\n\n2. **Anticipating Player Behavior**: Player 1 might be looking for a combination that reduces their Wheat use while still obtaining resources. I could anticipate that they\u2019d be willing to pay more for resources that I might have in surplus or excess\u2014such as excess Wood or Sheep.\n\nHere\u2019s the playbased on insights from the experts:\n- Propose **[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 3 Brick]** to Player 1 \u2013 it's a practical compromise that theoretically positions both participants for a more balanced trade. \n\nLet\u2019s execute this offer:\n\n**[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 3 Brick]**",

      "response": "[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 1: My focus is on maximizing total value by analyzing the current inventory and identifying undervalued or high-opportunity-cost resources. I observe that Brick (value 30) and Ore (value 34) are high-value, but we have large quantities (19 Brick, 24 Ore). Wheat (value 6) is low-value but abundant (24). Trading excess low-value goods for high-value scarce ones increases total value. However, we must ensure we\u2019re not giving away too much value in exchange.\n\n[Expert 2: Trade Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 1: I analyze Player 0's pattern of offers. They consistently request Ore and Brick\u2014our most valuable resources\u2014and offer Wheat and Sheep, which are lower or mid-tier in value. This suggests they are targeting our strength. Their repeated offers involving 2\u20133 Ore and 3\u20135 Brick, while offering modest returns, indicate aggressive extraction. Player 0 may be trying to exploit perceived abundance. Caution is warranted.\n\n[Expert 3: Opportunity Cost Analyst]  \nStep 1: I calculate net value transfer in each potential trade. Our Wheat is worth 6; offering 5 Wheat costs us 30 total value. Brick is 30 each, so 4 Brick is 120 value\u2014very costly to give up. Ore at 34 is even higher. We must gain more value than we lose. For example, offering 5 Wheat (value 30) and 1 Sheep (17) = total cost 47 to get 2 Ore (68 value). That appears favorable\u2014if the trade reflects true value. But we must consider scarcity and future opportunities.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 2: Let's assess our surplus. Wheat: 24 \u2014 high surplus, low value. Wood: 18 \u2014 unused so far, value 12. Sheep: 16 \u2014 solid but not scarce. Brick and Ore are high-value, but if we have surplus (e.g., we can acquire more later), trading some may be wise *if* we gain higher *net value*. However, giving away Brick and Ore cheaply is risky. Our previous offers tried to minimize Brick loss\u2014smart.\n\n[Expert 2: Trade Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 2: Player 0 keeps escalating\u2014first asking 2 Ore, 5 Brick for 4 Wheat, 3 Sheep (bad for us), now offering less (4 Wheat, 1 Sheep) for same 2 Ore, 3 Brick). They\u2019re testing persistence. Our counter-offers have tried to flip the value dynamic: offering low-value Wheat to get high-value Ore. Player 0 rejected\u2014suggests they are not desperate for Wheat. They likely have surplus. They value Ore and Brick highly\u2014possibly for a milestone.\n\n[Expert 3: Opportunity Cost Analyst]  \nStep 2: Evaluate last Player 0 offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore, 3 Brick.  \nWe give: 4\u00d76 + 1\u00d717 = 24 + 17 = 41 value  \nWe get: 2\u00d734 + 3\u00d730 = 68 + 90 = 158 value  \nThis seems extremely favorable. But wait\u2014is this a trap? Why would Player 0 offer such a lopsided deal? Either they misvalued, or they need Brick/Ore desperately and are bluffing scarcity. Or\u2014likely\u2014they *want* Wheat and Sheep for their own high-value use, but miscalculated.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 3: If the math holds, this offer gains us 158 value for 41\u2014we profit 117. Even if we have surplus Wheat and Sheep, this is a massive win. But we must ask: do we *need* Brick and Ore later? If yes, hoarding may be better. But with 24 Ore and 19 Brick, we can afford to spend 2\u20133 if replacement is possible. Given no info on production, we assume scarcity. Still\u2014such value gain is rare.\n\n[Expert 2: Trade Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 3: The offer is suspiciously good. Previous Player 0 behavior was aggressive\u2014now suddenly generous? Unlikely. More plausible: they need immediate Brick and Ore for a threshold (e.g., building cost). This is a \"desperation bid.\" They may fold if pressured. We could counter with a better-balanced offer to extract even more, or *accept* if we believe this is peak opportunity.\n\n[Expert 3: Opportunity Cost Analyst]  \nStep 3: Rechecking: we *have* 24 Wheat, 16 Sheep\u2014we can spare 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep. We gain 2 Ore and 3 Brick. But we *already have* 24 Ore and 19 Brick. Do we *need more*? Our goal is to *increase total value*, not hoard. However, this trade *does* increase value: we gain 158 value in return for 41. Even if we already have surplus, the net portfolio value still increases.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 4: I conclude: this trade increases total value significantly. Our inventory value currently is:  \nWheat: 24\u00d76 = 144  \nWood: 18\u00d712 = 216  \nSheep: 16\u00d717 = 272  \nBrick: 19\u00d730 = 570  \nOre: 24\u00d734 = 816  \nTotal: **2018**\n\nAfter trade (give 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep; gain 2 Ore, 3 Brick):  \nNew quantities:  \nWheat: 20 \u2192 120  \nSheep: 15 \u2192 255  \nBrick: 22 \u2192 660  \nOre: 26 \u2192 884  \nWood unchanged: 216  \nNew total: 120+216+255+660+884 = **2135** \u2192 +117 gain.\n\nThis is highly favorable.\n\n[Expert 2: Trade Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 4: I now believe this is a genuine desperation move by Player 0. They might be one Brick short of a key action. Our prior rejections pressured them. Accepting this gives us huge value, and removes their leverage. No better offers expected soon. Risk of bluff is low\u2014numbers are too skewed to be accidental.\n\n[Expert 3: Opportunity Cost Analyst]  \nStep 4: I confirm: this is the most value-positive trade proposed so far. Even considering future needs, a 117 point gain is unlikely to be outpaced by marginal future trades. Opportunity cost of *not* accepting is high.\n\nAll experts agree: accept the offer.\n\n[Accept]",

Player 0 keeps offering Wheat and Sheep (low-to-mid value for them?) and demanding Ore and Brick\u2014our highest-value resources (Ore=34, Brick=30). That suggests Player 0 *desperately* needs Ore and Brick, possibly for a critical build.  \nBut Player 0 is offering low-value goods in return.

Must reject.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Strategist]  \nStep 2: Post-trade, our current resources are:  \n- Wheat: 24 + 4 = **28**  \n- Sheep: 16 + 1 = **17**  \n- Ore: 24 - 2 = **22**  \n- Brick: 19 - 3 = **16**  \n- Wood: 18 (unchanged)  \nTotal value: (28\u00d76=168) + (18\u00d712=216) + (17\u00d717=289) + (16\u00d730=480) + (22\u00d734=748) = **1,901** \u2014 confirms loss.\n\nWe must now recover. Our highest-value resources are Ore (34) and Brick (30), and we\u2019re rich in them.  \nBut trading them for low-value goods (Wheat=6, Sheep=17) is losing strategy.\n\nWe should **only trade if we gain net value** \u2014 for example, give low-value excesses (Wheat, Wood) to get high-value items (Ore, Brick), not the reverse.\n\n[Expert 2: Trade Analyst]  \nStep 3: Current offer: \u201c6 Wheat, 3 Sheep \u2192 3 Ore, 5 Brick\u201d is clearly exploitative.  \nEven if we had excess Ore and Brick, this trade gives us 87 for 252 \u2014 terrible ratio.  \nWe must **deny**.\n\nBut better: **counter with a favorable offer**.  \nWe have surplus Wheat (28 now). Sheep is mid-value.  \nWe should *acquire* Ore and Brick, not give them away.\n\nBest move: **Offer low-value to get high-value**, or demand fair trade.\n\n[Expert 3: Behavioral Economist]  \nStep 3: Player 0 is escalating demands (from 2 Ore, 3 Brick \u2192 now 3 Ore, 5 Brick), while increasing their offer slightly (4\u21926 Wheat, 1\u21923 Sheep). They're testing boundaries.  \nBut they may be in a position where they *need* to trade, so perhaps we can flip the script.\n\nNew strategy: **Stop accepting losses. Start offering value-positive trades.**\n\nWe should try: Offer **Wheat and Wood** (medium surplus, lower value) for **Ore** (high value).  \nOr simply **refuse all exploitative offers** and wait.\n\nBut we must *increase* total value \u2014 so inaction may not be enough.\n\nProposal: Make a counter-offer that gives 5 Wheat, 3 Wood (5\u00d76 + 3\u00d712 = 30+36=66) for 2 Ore (68) \u2014 slight gain.\n\nOr better: aim for undervalued trades based on Player 0\u2019s hunger.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Strategist]  \nStep 3: We must **recover lost ground**. We're down 117 value.  \nLet\u2019s make an offer that gives low-value, gains high-value.\n\nWe have **28 Wheat** (lowest value) \u2014 safe to trade.\n\nWe have **18 Wood** \u2014 still good, but not critical.\n\nBest bet: **Offer Wheat + Sheep (which we gained) for more Ore** \u2014 but only if net positive.\n\nTry: Offer **5 Wheat, 2 Sheep** (5\u00d76=30, 2\u00d717=34 \u2192 64 value out)  \nRequest: **3 Ore** (3\u00d734=102) \u2014 net gain of 38.\n\nThat\u2019s strong.\n\nBut may be rejected. Alternatively, request **2 Ore and 1 Brick** (68+30=98) \u2014 still strong gain.\n\nBut Player 0 has kept requesting Brick \u2014 perhaps Brick is *more* valuable to them than us? But our Ore is highest value.\n\nPrioritize gaining, not giving, Ore.\n\nWait \u2014 we *have* 22 Ore left. Could we part with some in *favorable* trades?\n\nOnly if we get >34 value per Ore unit.\n\nBut Player 0 is offering <20 per Ore \u2014 terrible.\n\nSo: **Deny current offer. Make strong counter.**\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 3 Ore]",

      "response": "To assist you in your trading decisions, I'll outline three different types of experts, each providing their insights step by step:\n\n### Expert 1: The Resource Value Analyst\n- **Step 1**: Analyze current resources and their values.\n  - Wheat: 17 (6 each) = 102\n  - Wood: 15 (11 each) = 165\n  - Sheep: 8 (17 each) = 136\n  - Brick: 21 (22 each) = 462\n  - Ore: 8 (34 each) = 272\n  - **Total Value**: 1,137\n\n### Expert 2: The Trade Strategist\n- **Step 2**: Assess trade offers already made and evaluate Player 1's offers.\n  - Offers made by Player 1 have not been in Player 0's favor.\n  - Most offers involve Wheat, which has a lower value compared to other resources.\n  - Player 1 values Ore and Brick higher, so Player 0 should focus on getting a balance of these resources in return.\n\n### Expert 3: The Market Observer\n- **Step 3**: Look at the market dynamics based on previous trades.\n  - Player 0's latest accepted offer included 4 Wheat and 1 Sheep for 2 Ore and 3 Brick. This trade, albeit not maximizing value, was accepted, suggesting that it could have been perceived as balanced by Player 1.\n  - Multiple rejected offers indicate a misalignment in perceived value; thus, there's potential for a better offer adjustment.\n\n### Next Steps\nBased on the analysis:\n\n1. **Expert 1** suggests aiming for more Ore, as the value outweighs the resources being offered.\n2. **Expert 2** recommends avoiding low-value resources (Wheat and Sheep) to maximize profit in future trades.\n3. **Expert 3** needs an actionable plan. \n\n### Player 0's Response to Player 1's New Offer\nGiven Player 1's last offer of [Offered items: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> Requested items: 3 Ore], which likely does not benefit Player 0 substantially, the preferred response would be:\n\n**[Deny]**\n\nNow, let's conclude with a proposed next offer based on the analysis:\n\n**Proposed Offer**: \n- [Offer: 4 Brick, 2 Ore -> 3 Sheep, 3 Wheat] \n- This offer attempts to trade surplus resources (Brick and Ore, which are highly valued) for Sheep and Wheat, attempting to gain two primary resources for future trades and to maintain diversity in inventory. \n\nNext steps will follow, ensuring identification of strategic offers that utilize more valuable resources while continually adjusting based on Player 1's responses.",
