Since I notice that brick has a significantly higher value compared to the amount I have, it would be wise to acquire more brick while trading away less valuable resources.

      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the advisory process as described in the game instructions. As Player 1, my goal is to trade in a way that increases the total value of my resources. To analyze the incoming offer from Player 0\u2014[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]\u2014I'll consult three different trading experts. These experts are designed to provide diverse perspectives that could help with this decision:\n\n1. **Expert 1: Value Analyst** - Focuses on calculating and maximizing the net value of trades based on the provided resource values. This expert ensures we're strictly adhering to the goal of increasing total value.\n   \n2. **Expert 2: Resource Balancer** - Emphasizes resource quantities and overall portfolio balance, considering how trades might affect long-term availability (e.g., for future turns in this 10-turn game).\n\n3. **Expert 3: Negotiation Tactics Expert** - Thinks about the broader game dynamics, such as relationship-building, potential counteroffers, and the risk of rejecting offers in a multi-turn game.\n\nThe experts will proceed in steps: each will write down one step of their thinking, share it with the group, then move to the next step collectively. If an expert realizes their reasoning is flawed or unhelpful, they will leave the discussion.\n\nI'll now simulate the experts' dialogue based on the current situation. My resources and their values are:\n- Wheat: Qty 12, Total Value 6 (per unit: ~0.5)\n- Wood: Qty 12, Total Value 12 (per unit: ~1)\n- Sheep: Qty 14, Total Value 12 (per unit: ~0.857)\n- Brick: Qty 7, Total Value 26 (per unit: ~3.714)\n- Ore: Qty 7, Total Value 33 (per unit: ~4.714)\n\nPlayer 0's offer: They want to give me 3 Sheep and 2 Ore in exchange for 5 Brick and 2 Sheep from me. I'll calculate values as needed during the experts' discussion.\n\n---\n\n### **Expert Discussion**\n\n#### **Step 1: Initial Thinking**\nEach expert shares their first step of analysis.\n\n- **Expert 1 (Value Analyst)**: \"As a Value Analyst, my first step is to calculate the net value change from this trade. Player 0 is offering 3 Sheep (value: 3 * ~0.857 = ~2.57) and 2 Ore (value: 2 * ~4.714 = ~9.43), for a total received value of ~12. I'm giving 5 Brick (value: 5 * ~3.714 = ~18.57) and 2 Sheep (value: 2 * ~0.857 = ~1.71), for a total given value of ~20.28. This results in a net loss of ~8.28 in total value. We should avoid this trade to meet our goal.\"\n\n- **Expert 2 (Resource Balancer)**: \"From a balancing perspective, I start by checking quantities. I have plenty of Sheep (14 qty), so giving away 2 Sheep and receiving 3 more isn't a big issue\u2014it might even help stabilize my stock. However, I'm giving away 5 Brick (out of only 7), which could leave me short on Brick for future turns. In a 10-turn game, maintaining a diverse set of resources is key, so I need to weigh if the incoming Ore (which I have only 7 of) justifies the loss.\"\n\n- **Expert 3 (Negotiation Tactics Expert)**: \"My initial thought is about the bigger picture: rejecting this might strain relations with Player 0, especially in a 10-turn game where future trades could be beneficial. But we must prioritize our goal. If this offer doesn't increase value, I should consider a counteroffer, like [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore], to test their flexibility without committing yet.\"\n\n#### **Step 2: Reacting to Each Other**\nThe experts share and build on the previous step's insights.\n\n- **Expert 1 (Value Analyst)**: \"Building on what we've shared, my calculation shows a clear net loss (~8.28), which directly violates our objective. Expert 2's point about quantities is valid, but it doesn't override the value metric\u2014we're not just balancing resources; we're maximizing value. If Expert 3 wants a counteroffer, it must still result in a net gain. Otherwise, this is a no-go.\"\n\n- **Expert 2 (Resource Balancer)**: \"Expert 1's value breakdown confirms my concern about losing Brick, which has high per-unit value. After this trade, I'd have only 2 Brick left, potentially limiting options in later turns. Expert 3's idea of a counteroffer is intriguing, but I agree with Expert 1\u2014any move must increase overall value. I'm not seeing how this original offer helps my quantity strategy.\"\n\n- **Expert 3 (Negotiation Tactics Expert)**: \"Expert 1 and Expert 2 make solid points; the net value loss is undeniable, and it could hurt our resource pool. In negotiations, we sometimes accept small losses for goodwill, but not here\u2014our primary task is to increase value. I'll pivot: let's deny this and propose a counteroffer that flips the value in our favor, like [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]. If that doesn't work, rejecting is safer.\"\n\n#### **Step 3: Final Evaluation and Conclusion**\nThe experts refine their thoughts and decide if anyone should leave.\n\n- **Expert 1 (Value Analyst)**: \"After reviewing the group's input, my analysis holds: this trade decreases total value, and no one has contradicted that with evidence. Expert 3's counteroffer idea could be viable if it leads to a net gain, but for this specific offer, I'm recommending denial. I see no flaws in my reasoning, so I'll stay.\"\n\n- **Expert 2 (Resource Balancer)**: \"Expert 1's value calc and Expert 3's tactics align with my quantity concerns. This trade would imbalance my resources without clear benefits. I'm not wrong here, so I'll remain to advise on future decisions.\"\n\n- **Expert 3 (Negotiation Tactics Expert)**: \"I've realized my initial emphasis on goodwill might be misleading\u2014we're in a competitive game, and prioritizing value is key. Since this offer doesn't increase value and could weaken our position, I can't justify it. I'll stay for now but suggest we counteroffer next turn if possible.\"\n\nNo experts are leaving, as their reasoning remains relevant. However, the group consensus is clear: the trade does not increase total value.\n\n---\n\n### **My Decision as Player 1**\nBased on the experts' analysis, accepting Player 0's offer would result in a net decrease in the total value of my resources (~8.28 loss). While a counteroffer like [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore] was suggested, the game instructions require me to respond directly to the incoming offer with [Accept] or [Deny] for this turn.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the negotiation process as Player 1 in the Negotiation Game. My goal is to trade in a way that increases the total value of my resources. First, I'll briefly update my current resources based on the trade history you provided:\n\n- **Initial resources (before trades):**\n  - Wheat: Qty: 12, Value: 6\n  - Wood: Qty: 12, Value: 12\n  - Sheep: Qty: 14, Value: 12\n  - Brick: Qty: 7, Value: 26\n  - Ore: Qty: 7, Value: 33\n\n- **After accepting Player 0's offer (Gave: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep | Received: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore):**\n  - Wheat: Qty: 12, Value: 6 (unchanged)\n  - Wood: Qty: 12, Value: 12 (unchanged)\n  - Sheep: Qty: 14 - 2 + 3 = 15, Value: 12 (net gain, but value remains the same as it's tied to the resource type)\n  - Brick: Qty: 7 - 5 = 2, Value: 26 (now reduced quantity)\n  - Ore: Qty: 7 + 2 = 9, Value: 33 (net gain)\n\n- **Current total value estimate:** Based on the provided values, my total value is now approximately 6 + 12 + 12 + (adjusted for Brick's reduced quantity, but since values seem tied to the resource, I'll assume it's a fixed total for tracking purposes). The key is to aim for trades that increase this overall value.\n\nTo analyze the situation and decide on my next action, I'll consult three trading experts, as per your instructions. I've selected experts that would be most helpful for this trading decision:\n\n1. **Expert 1: Value Optimizer** \u2013 Focuses on maximizing the net value of my resources by calculating gains and losses from potential trades.\n2. **Expert 2: Resource Balancer** \u2013 Emphasizes diversifying or balancing my resource quantities to avoid shortages and prepare for future needs.\n3. **Expert 3: Negotiation Strategist** \u2013 Considers the opponent's perspective, past behavior (e.g., Player 0 rejected my offer), and long-term game strategy.\n\nThe experts will discuss in steps: each writes one step of their thinking, shares it with the group, and then they proceed to the next step. If any expert realizes they're wrong, they'll leave the discussion.\n\n### Experts' Discussion\n\n**Step 1: Initial Thinking (Each expert shares their first thought based on the current situation.)**\n\n- **Expert 1 (Value Optimizer):** My analysis starts with the net value. After the last trade, I gained 2 Ore (part of a resource with high value: 33) but lost 5 Brick (from a resource with value: 26). That's a potential net value gain since Ore's value is higher. However, Player 0 rejected my identical offer back to them, suggesting they might value Brick more than I do. I should propose a new offer that ensures I gain more high-value resources like Ore while minimizing losses. Target: Propose a trade where the incoming resources' value exceeds the outgoing ones by at least 10-20% to justify the risk.\n\n- **Expert 2 (Resource Balancer):** I'm looking at quantities now. I have plenty of Sheep (15 qty) and Wheat/Wood (both 12 qty), but Brick is now critically low at only 2 qty, which could limit future options. Ore is up to 9 qty, which is good for diversity. We should avoid trading away more Brick until we replenish it. Instead, leverage our surplus Sheep (low risk to trade) to get more Brick or other balanced resources. This would prevent over-reliance on any one type.\n\n- **Expert 3 (Negotiation Strategist):** Considering Player 0's actions, they offered us resources and accepted a trade once, but rejected our mirror offer. This implies they might have a surplus of Sheep and Ore but need Brick badly. We have 10 turns total, and this is likely mid-game, so I need to be strategic\u2014don't overcommit early. Propose something slightly adjusted from our last offer to test them, but make it more appealing to their needs to build rapport for future turns.\n\n**Step 2: Reacting to Each Other's Initial Thoughts (Experts build on what was shared.)**\n\n- **Expert 1 (Value Optimizer):** I agree with Expert 2 on not trading more Brick\u2014it's already depleted, and its value (26) is significant. Expert 3's point about Player 0's needs is spot on; if they rejected our offer, maybe they don't want to give up more Ore. Let's adjust: Offer some Sheep (we have a surplus) for Brick and a bit less Ore. Net value calculation: If I offer 3 Sheep (value portion: low, since total Sheep value is 12 for 15 qty) for 4 Brick (part of value 26), that could net a gain if Brick's value per unit is higher than Sheep's.\n\n- **Expert 2 (Resource Balancer):** Expert 1's value focus aligns with my balancing goal\u2014trading Sheep for Brick would directly address our shortage. Expert 3, you're right about strategy; Player 0 might be hoarding Brick, so we shouldn't mirror our last offer. I'm on board with proposing Sheep for Brick, but let's ensure we don't give away too much Sheep, as we still have 15 qty. Aim for a trade that keeps us above 10 qty in key resources.\n\n- **Expert 3 (Negotiation Strategist):** Expert 1 and Expert 2 are syncing well here. My concern is escalation\u2014Player 0 rejected once, so if we propose something too aggressive, they might shut down trades. Let's make the offer fair but tipped in our favor. Based on their past offer, they gave us Sheep and Ore for Brick, so they likely value Brick highly. Propose: Offer Sheep and maybe a small amount of another surplus (like Wheat) for Brick, to sweeten the deal without risking Ore.\n\n**Step 3: Refining the Strategy (Experts finalize or adjust based on the discussion.)**\n\n- **Expert 1 (Value Optimizer):** After hearing everyone, I'm confident in this direction. A trade like offering 3 Sheep and 1 Wheat (low value loss) for 4-5 Brick (high value gain) could increase our total value. Quick calc: Wheat value is 6 for 12 qty, so 1 Wheat is minor; Sheep is 12 for 15 qty, so 3 Sheep is still sustainable. This nets a positive value. No issues here\u2014let's go with it.\n\n- **Expert 2 (Resource Balancer):** Solid plan. This keeps Brick from hitting zero and maintains our Sheep surplus. Expert 3's strategic angle ensures we're not burning bridges. I don't see any flaws, so I'll stick around.\n\n- **Expert 3 (Negotiation Strategist):** This refined offer feels balanced and forward-thinking. It addresses Player 0's likely needs while protecting our resources. No red flags\u2014I'm in.\n\n(All experts remain, as no one realized they were wrong.)\n\n### Final Decision as Player 1\nBased on the experts' discussion, the consensus is to propose a new offer that leverages my surplus resources (Sheep and a bit of Wheat) to gain more Brick, focusing on value gain, balance, and strategy. This should increase my total resource value while addressing shortages.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 5 Brick]",

      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the thinking process of three trading experts advising me (Player 1) on how to respond to the current situation. As Player 1, my goal is to increase the total value of my resources, which are currently:\n\n- [Wheat] Qty: 12, Value: 6\n- [Wood] Qty: 12, Value: 12\n- [Sheep] Qty: 14, Value: 12\n- [Brick] Qty: 7, Value: 26\n- [Ore] Qty: 7, Value: 33\n\nThe current offer from Player 0 is: [Offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 7 Brick]. This means they want me to give them 7 Brick in exchange for 4 Sheep and 1 Ore.\n\nI selected the following three experts as most helpful for this trading decision:\n1. **Value Maximizer Expert**: Focuses on calculating and maximizing the net value of trades based on my resource values.\n2. **Quantity Strategist Expert**: Analyzes resource quantities for balance and long-term needs, assuming a game like this might require diverse resources.\n3. **Negotiation Expert**: Considers trading history, opponent behavior, and strategic leverage to optimize deals.\n\nThe experts will each write one step of their thinking, share it with the group, then proceed to the next step. If any expert realizes they're wrong, they leave. I'll facilitate this process until they reach a consensus or conclusion, then I'll make my decision as Player 1.\n\n### Expert Discussion\n\n**Round 1: First Step of Thinking**\n\n- **Value Maximizer Expert's Step 1**: My analysis starts with the values: Player 0 offers 4 Sheep (value \u2248 4/14 of 12 = \u22482.857) and 1 Ore (value \u2248 1/7 of 33 = \u22484.714), totaling \u22487.571 in value. I'm giving 7 Brick (value 26). This is a net loss of \u224818.429 in value. We should reject this outright\u2014it's not maximizing my total value.\n\n- **Quantity Strategist Expert's Step 1**: I agree with the Value Maximizer; let's check quantities. I have 14 Sheep already, so adding 4 more doesn't help much, and I only have 7 Ore, so gaining 1 is minor. But losing all 7 Brick (a key resource) would imbalance my portfolio, as Brick is scarce for me. This trade seems risky for future turns.\n\n- **Negotiation Expert's Step 1**: From the history, Player 0 rejected my earlier offer and accepted one where I gave less. They're pushing for Brick, which might be valuable to them. If I accept this, I'm overgiving. I should deny and counter with something that tests their limits, like offering less Brick.\n\n*Sharing Round 1*: The group shares: Value Maximizer highlights a clear value loss, Quantity Strategist notes resource imbalance risks, and Negotiation Expert sees an opportunity for a better counteroffer. No one sees an immediate flaw in their reasoning, so we proceed.\n\n**Round 2: Second Step of Thinking**\n\n- **Value Maximizer Expert's Step 2**: Building on my first point, even if I adjust for potential future value (e.g., if Sheep could be traded elsewhere), the immediate loss is too high. My total value is currently 6 + 12 + 12 + 26 + 33 = 89. Accepting would drop it to \u224889 - 26 + 7.571 = \u224870.571. This confirms rejection; perhaps propose a counter where I gain more value.\n\n- **Quantity Strategist Expert's Step 2**: I still see issues\u2014my Brick is at 7, and giving it all away leaves me with zero, which could hurt in later turns. Sheep is already abundant at 14, so prioritizing quantity balance supports denying. No change in my view.\n\n- **Negotiation Expert's Step 2**: History shows Player 0 is aggressive but accepted my last offer (3 Sheep, 1 Wheat for 5 Brick). I could counter with something similar but adjusted, like offering 4-5 Brick for their 4 Sheep and 1 Ore. If they reject again, it builds leverage. My advice holds.\n\n*Sharing Round 2*: The group shares: All experts reinforce denial due to value loss, imbalance, and strategic history. No one is wrong, so we proceed to a final step for consensus.\n\n**Round 3: Third Step of Thinking (Final Consensus)**\n\n- **Value Maximizer Expert's Step 3**: After reviewing the shared thoughts, I'm confident in my initial analysis. This trade decreases my value, and no new info changes that. We should deny and make a counteroffer that nets positive value, like requesting more Ore or less Brick given.\n\n- **Quantity Strategist Expert's Step 3**: Agreed\u2014denying maintains my current balance. If we counter, ensure it doesn't deplete Brick further. No flaws in the group's reasoning.\n\n- **Negotiation Expert's Step 3**: Solid points all around. Denying and countering keeps the negotiation alive, especially with turns left. Final advice: Deny and offer something where I give less high-value resources.\n\n*Sharing Round 3*: The group concludes unanimously: Deny the offer and make a counteroffer to potentially improve the deal. All experts stand by their advice, so no one leaves.\n\n### My Decision as Player 1\nBased on the experts' consensus, accepting Player 0's offer would decrease my total resource value and disrupt my quantities, so I'll deny it. However, to keep negotiations going and potentially improve my position, I'll make a counteroffer: I'll offer 5 Brick (less than their request) in exchange for their 4 Sheep and 1 Ore, as this might align better with my value goals.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 4 Sheep, 1 Ore]",

      "response": "**Expert Analysis:**\n\n**Expert 1: Market Analyst**  \n- Assessing the value of each resource, I notice that Wheat is worth 5, Wood is worth 10, Sheep is worth 13, Brick is worth 27, and Ore is worth 38. The most valuable item currently held is Ore, while Brick is also highly valued, making it a prime target for trading.  \n- I suggest a strategy focusing on trading ore for bricks or other high-value resources. A trade that involves fewer Flint or Sheep for more Brick could yield a higher total value.  \n\n**Expert 2: Resource Strategist**  \n- Looking at the current stockpile, I identify that trading Sheep provides an excellent opportunity for value increase because of their relatively high value (13). The trades made so far allowed for some enhancement in resources. I would advise aiming to offload excess Sheep for goods that yield a better middle-ground exchange.\n- My suggestion would be to continue trading excess Sheep for Brick or even appealing to trade Ore judiciously given its high value to obtain better ratios of exchange.\n  \n**Expert 3: Risk Management Specialist**  \n- Analyzing possible trading risks, it becomes evident that we should not overcommit resources like Ore, which are crucial for future trades. Instead, the focus should be on balancing what we offer without depleting too many core resources.\n- Proceed with an offer that minimizes the risk of resource depletion while also maximizing value. Prioritizing trades that use lesser resources but yield a higher quantity of the valued goods, such as Brick, constrains potential losses.\n\n**Next Actions Based on Expert Input:**\n\n- **Expert 1 Strategy**: I will suggest trading more Ore, as it brings high value. \n- **Expert 2 Suggestion**: Keep trading some Sheep for potential gains in Brick.\n- **Expert 3 Caution**: Ensure to not trade away too much Ore or Wheat.\n\n**Player 0's Next Move:**\nSince Player 1 has made an offer of `'4 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 7 Brick'`, I recognize that trading away Sheep will lead to a loss too great against my stock, especially with enough value in Brick.  \n- I will respectfully decline the offer as it doesn't provide a beneficial increase in value.\n\nAction to take:  \n`[Deny]`",

      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the process as described in the query. As Player 1 in the Negotiation Game, my primary goal is to trade in a way that increases the total value of my resources. To do this, I'll first consider what types of experts would be most helpful for analyzing the current situation and advising on my next move.\n\n### Step 1: Selecting the Experts\nBased on the game context\u2014where I need to evaluate trades, assess resource values, and navigate ongoing negotiations\u2014I'll select three distinct trading experts. These experts are tailored to provide diverse perspectives that can help maximize my gains while considering risks and strategies:\n\n1. **Expert A: Value Optimizer** - This expert focuses purely on calculating and maximizing the net value of trades based on my resource values. They ensure every decision increases my total resource value.\n   \n2. **Expert B: Resource Balancer** - This expert emphasizes maintaining a balanced portfolio of resources, avoiding depletion of key items (e.g., ensuring I don't trade away too much of a scarce resource), even if it means a slightly lower immediate value gain.\n\n3. **Expert C: Negotiation Strategist** - This expert thinks about the broader game dynamics, such as patterns in Player 0's rejections, psychological leverage, and escalating offers to pressure Player 0 into better deals.\n\nNow, I'll simulate the experts' discussion. Each expert will write down one step of their thinking, share it with the group, and then they all proceed to the next step. If any expert realizes their advice is flawed (e.g., it doesn't align with the goal or facts), they will leave the discussion.\n\n### Experts' Discussion\n\n**Round 1: Each expert shares their first step of thinking.**\n\n- **Expert A (Value Optimizer):** \"Step 1: Let's review my current resources and their total values: Wheat (12 qty, value 6), Wood (12 qty, value 12), Sheep (14 qty, value 12), Brick (7 qty, value 26), Ore (7 qty, value 33). Total value = 6 + 12 + 12 + 26 + 33 = 89. From the history, Player 0 has been rejecting offers involving Brick, which has high value (26 for 7 qty). I should prioritize trades that net me more value, like offering low-value resources (e.g., Wheat or Sheep) for high-value ones Player 0 might have. My initial advice: Propose a trade that increases my total value by at least 5-10 points.\"\n\n- **Expert B (Resource Balancer):** \"Step 1: I agree with Expert A on checking values, but I must ensure we don't overtrade scarce items. I have only 7 Brick and 7 Ore, both critical for potential future trades or game needs. From history, Player 0 accepted an offer where I gave 5 Brick, so we're dipping into Brick stock. We should avoid offers that leave us with less than 5 of any resource. My initial advice: Balance value gain with sustainability\u2014only trade if we end up with more diverse quantities.\"\n\n- **Expert C (Negotiation Strategist):** \"Step 1: Looking at the history, Player 0 rejected my previous offers (e.g., 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat for 5 Brick) but accepted one earlier. This suggests they're selective, perhaps valuing Brick highly or testing our persistence. We should escalate slightly but not overcommit\u2014make them feel like we're compromising to build rapport. My initial advice: Use a pattern of small adjustments to wear them down, aiming for a win on the 10th turn if needed.\"\n\n**Round 2: Experts respond to the previous steps and share their next step of thinking.**\n\n- **Expert A (Value Optimizer):** \"Step 2: Building on the others, let's calculate a potential trade. If I offer 4 Sheep (value: 4 Sheep * (12/14 \u2248 0.857 per Sheep) = roughly 3.43 of my total Sheep value) and 1 Wheat (value: 1/12 of 6 \u2248 0.5), for something like 3 Ore from Player 0 (assuming Ore's value to them is similar), that could net me +10-15 value if Ore is worth more to me. Wait, hold on\u2014my resources show Ore at 33 value for 7 qty, so it's high-value. Proposing to give away Sheep (low relative value per unit) for Ore would increase my total to over 100. This aligns with my goal. Advice: Go for it.\"\n\n- **Expert B (Resource Balancer):** \"Step 2: Expert A's idea is tempting, but I have concerns. I only have 14 Sheep, and we've already traded some in history. If we offer 4 Sheep, we'd drop to 10, which is still okay, but combining it with Wheat (which I have plenty of at 12 qty) keeps us balanced. However, if we gain Ore, we must ensure it doesn't unbalance us further\u2014Ore is at 7 qty already. I think this works as long as we don't go below 5 Sheep. Advice: Proceed cautiously.\"\n\n- **Expert C (Negotiation Strategist):** \"Step 2: Expert A and B make sense, but let's think strategy. Player 0 rejected our last offer (4 Sheep, 1 Ore for 7 Brick), so mirroring or slightly improving could work. Escalate by offering less of what they rejected and adding a low-cost item. This might make them accept to reciprocate past agreements. Advice: Refine the offer to be more appealing.\"\n\n**Round 3: Experts continue to the next step, refining or concluding their thoughts.**\n\n- **Expert A (Value Optimizer):** \"Step 3: After reviewing, a refined offer could be: Offer 4 Sheep and 1 Wheat for 3 Ore. Value calculation: I'm giving away \u22483.43 (Sheep) + 0.5 (Wheat) = 3.93 value, and gaining 3 Ore (3/7 of 33 \u2248 11.14 value). Net gain: +7.21, pushing total to 96.21. This clearly increases value. No flaws here\u2014I'm staying.\"\n\n- **Expert B (Resource Balancer):** \"Step 3: Expert A's numbers check out, and post-trade, I'd have: Sheep: 14-4=10 (still above 5), Wheat: 12-1=11 (plenty), Ore: 7+3=10 (more balanced). This doesn't deplete anything critically. I'm on board. Advice: Finalize this.\"\n\n- **Expert C (Negotiation Strategist):** \"Step 3: This offer escalates slightly from history (e.g., we offered 4 Sheep before and got rejected, so adding Wheat as a sweetener could work). It pressures Player 0 without overcommitting. Solid plan. Advice: Make the offer now.\"\n\nAt this point, all experts agree on the direction, so no one is leaving the discussion. They've converged on a recommendation.\n\n### My Decision as Player 1\nBased on the experts' analysis, the consensus is to propose a trade that maximizes value while maintaining balance and strategic leverage. I'll go with their refined suggestion: Offer 4 Sheep and 1 Wheat in exchange for 3 Ore. This should increase my total resource value and align with the game's goal.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 3 Ore]",

The last accepted trade was beneficial, trading 3 Sheep and 2 Ore for 5 Brick and 2 Sheep. Brick has a high value, so it would be advantageous to acquire more Brick if possible.\n  \n### Resource Strategist Expert's Analysis\n1. Assessing the resources: Player 0 has ample Wheat, Wood, and Ore, with a shortage of Brick and Sheep. The last trade shows that Sheep can be used as leverage to acquire more Brick. Maximizing Brick acquisition while minimizing the loss of valuable resources should be prioritized. \n\n### Risk Management Expert's Analysis\n1. Considering the risk of trades: Player 0 is currently in a good position with resources but should avoid giving too much value in trades that don\u2019t benefit resource accumulation. Trades involving Ore or large quantities of Sheep should be carefully weighed against the return received in Brick or other high-value resources.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps for Each Expert:\nNow, each expert will propose the next best move based on their analysis.\n\n#### Economist Expert's Next Step\n- **[Offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 6 Brick]**  \nThis offer leverages the abundance of Sheep and Wheat to acquire more Brick.\n\n#### Resource Strategist Expert's Next Step\n- **[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Ore -> 8 Brick]**  \nBy trading Wood (which has lower overall value) and Ore for more Brick, Player 0 can increase their resources strategically.\n\n#### Risk Management Expert's Next Step\n- **[Deny]**  \nIf any offers come in from Player 1 that consist of low-value returns for high-value resources, they should deny them to prevent loss.\n\n### Continuing the Game:\nAs the game progresses, actions will depend on whether the offers made by Player 0 are accepted or rejected by Player 1 and what counter-offers are subsequently made. The chosen experts will adapt their strategies accordingly based on the outcomes of trades and the evolving resource situation.",

This expert will help decide if accepting, denying, or counter-offering is tactically sound.\n\nThe experts will proceed step by step:\n- Each writes one step of their thinking.\n- They share their steps with the group.\n- They move to the next step collectively.\n- If any expert realizes their reasoning is flawed (e.g., based on incorrect assumptions), they leave the discussion.\n\nAfter the experts conclude, I'll make my decision as Player 1, using the required format ([Accept], [Deny], or [Offer]).\n\n---\n\n### Expert Deliberation Process\n\n**Step 1: Each expert writes their first step of thinking.**\n\n- **Value Expert**: \"As Player 1, my current resources have the following per-unit values based on the totals provided: Wheat (~0.5 per unit), Wood (1 per unit), Sheep (~0.857 per unit), Brick (~3.714 per unit), and Ore (~4.714 per unit). For Player 0's offer (giving me 4 Sheep and 1 Wheat in exchange for 6 Brick), I'll calculate the net value: I'm receiving 4 Sheep (~4 * 0.857 = 3.428 value) + 1 Wheat (0.5 value) = 3.928 total value. I'm giving 6 Brick (~6 * 3.714 = 22.284 value). This results in a net loss of about 18.356 value. We should deny this unless we can negotiate better.\"\n\n- **Resource Expert**: \"Focusing on quantities, I have 7 Brick, which is a limited and high-value resource (total value 26). Giving away 6 Brick would leave me with only 1, potentially crippling my options in future trades. In return, I'm getting 4 Sheep (I already have 14) and 1 Wheat (I have 12), which don't address any shortages. This trade depletes my high-value assets without balancing my portfolio, so it seems unwise.\"\n\n- **History Expert**: \"Looking at past interactions, Player 0 has been inconsistent: They accepted my offer of 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat for 5 Brick earlier, but rejected similar offers from me and made counter-offers like 4 Sheep, 1 Ore for 7 Brick, which I denied. This suggests Player 0 is pushing for more Brick while giving less valuable resources. Accepting this offer might encourage more aggressive demands, so we should deny or counter to test their limits.\"\n\n**Sharing Step 1:** The experts share their thoughts. No one sees an immediate flaw, so we proceed to Step 2.\n\n**Step 2: Each expert writes their second step, building on the shared thoughts.**\n\n- **Value Expert**: \"Building on my calculation, our total value is currently 89 (sum of all resource values: 6 + 12 + 12 + 26 + 33). If we accept, we'd lose ~22.284 from Brick but gain ~3.928, dropping our total to about 70.644\u2014a clear decrease. Even if we adjust for non-linear values, this is a loss. I recommend denying and proposing a counter-offer that flips the net to positive, like offering less Brick for more valuable resources from them.\"\n\n- **Resource Expert**: \"Agreeing with the Value Expert's numbers, depleting Brick to 1 qty would make it hard to trade in the remaining turns (we're likely near the 10-turn limit based on history). Player 0 has offered Sheep and Wheat multiple times, which I have in abundance (14 Sheep, 12 Wheat). We could counter by requesting Ore (high value at ~4.714 per unit) instead. This aligns with maintaining balance and avoiding shortages.\"\n\n- **History Expert**: \"The Value Expert's loss calculation reinforces my observation: Player 0 rejected my previous offers and keeps asking for Brick, possibly because they're short on it. In past turns, they've accepted when I offered Sheep and Wheat for Brick, but only on favorable terms. Denying here might prompt a better offer from them, as they've made no new offers after rejections before. Let's deny and counter with something like offering 2-3 Brick for more Ore or Wheat to exploit their pattern.\"\n\n**Sharing Step 2:** The experts share again. All reasoning holds, so we proceed to Step 3.\n\n**Step 3: Each expert writes their third step, finalizing their advice.**\n\n- **Value Expert**: \"After reviewing the group's input, my analysis confirms a net loss, and there's no way to justify this trade without decreasing total value. We have 7 turns left (based on the history provided), so denying and counter-offering could still lead to gains. I stand by denial and suggest a counter that ensures a positive net value.\"\n\n- **Resource Expert**: \"No flaws in the discussion\u2014the trade would imbalance my resources further. Final advice: Deny and propose a counter that protects my Brick stock.\"\n\n- **History Expert**: \"Everything checks out; Player 0's history supports denying to negotiate upward. If we counter, make it strategic based on their past accepts. I'm confident in this path.\"\n\n**Sharing Step 3:** The experts share their final thoughts. No one realizes they're wrong, so the discussion concludes.\n\n### Final Decision as Player 1\nBased on the experts' analysis, accepting Player 0's offer would decrease the total value of my resources and deplete my high-value Brick without sufficient compensation. Instead, I'll deny the offer and make a counter-offer that aims for a net value gain, as suggested. My counter: Offer 3 Brick (value ~11.142) in exchange for 2 Ore (value ~9.428) and 2 Sheep (value ~1.714), which would net me a small gain while addressing resource balance.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore, 2 Sheep]",

      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the analysis as per your instructions. As Player 1 in the Negotiation Game, my goal is to trade in a way that increases the total value of my resources. First, I'll define the three trading experts I believe would be most helpful for this decision. These experts are tailored to provide diverse perspectives on trading strategy, based on the current game state.\n\n### Current Game State Recap:\n- **My Resources (after accepting Player 0's last offer: 4 Sheep and 1 Wheat for 6 Brick)**:\n  - Wheat: Qty: 13 (Value: 6)  [Updated from 12 + 1]\n  - Wood: Qty: 12 (Value: 12)  [Unchanged]\n  - Sheep: Qty: 18 (Value: 12)  [Updated from 14 + 4]\n  - Brick: Qty: 1 (Value: 26)   [Updated from 7 - 6]\n  - Ore: Qty: 7 (Value: 33)     [Unchanged]\n- **Total Resource Value**: Originally 89 (as calculated from your initial values). After the trade:\n  - Gave away: 6 Brick (portion of Value: 26, so net loss based on proportion, but we'll treat values as tied to quantities for simplicity).\n  - Received: 4 Sheep and 1 Wheat (added to existing).\n  - New Total Value: 6 (Wheat) + 12 (Wood) + 12 (Sheep) + 26 (Brick) + 33 (Ore) = 89 (no net change yet, but we aim to increase it).\n- **Game Progress**: The game has 10 turns total. Based on the history, several turns have passed, and it's now my turn as Player 1 to potentially make an offer, respond, or pass. Player 0 might be waiting for my next move.\n\n### Chosen Experts:\nTo analyze this situation effectively, I've selected three experts with complementary perspectives:\n1. **Value Maximization Expert**: Focuses on quantifying and maximizing the net value of trades, ensuring each deal increases my total resource value.\n2. **Resource Balance Expert**: Emphasizes maintaining a balanced portfolio of resources to avoid depletion (e.g., Brick is now very low), prioritizing sustainability over short-term gains.\n3. **Opportunity Seizing Expert**: Looks for patterns in past trades (e.g., Player 0's rejections and acceptances) to propose aggressive or opportunistic offers that could lead to quick gains.\n\nThe experts will now analyze the situation step by step. Each will write one step of their thinking, share it with the group, and then proceed to the next step. If any expert realizes their advice is flawed (e.g., based on incorrect assumptions), they will leave the discussion.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Thinking (Each expert shares their first thought)\n- **Value Maximization Expert**: \"As Player 1, our total value is still at 89 after the last trade, which was neutral. Player 0 has shown interest in Brick (they've requested it multiple times) but rejected offers involving too many of their resources. We should propose a trade that nets us more value\u2014e.g., offering excess Sheep (which has low value per quantity) for something high-value like Ore, which could boost our total to over 100.\"\n  \n- **Resource Balance Expert**: \"Brick is critically low at only 1 quantity, and we've given away a lot recently. We need to be cautious not to trade away more Brick or deplete Wheat/Ore, as that could leave us unbalanced for future turns. Let's evaluate any offer to ensure we don't drop below safe levels (e.g., keep at least 1 of each resource).\"\n  \n- **Opportunity Seizing Expert**: \"Player 0 has accepted trades involving Sheep and rejected ones with too much Ore, so they're likely low on Brick and open to Sheep deals. We have plenty of Sheep (18 qty), so we should push for a bold offer now\u2014maybe trade Sheep for Ore to capitalize on their past patterns before the game ends.\"\n\nNo expert has realized they're wrong, so they proceed to Step 2.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Building on Shared Thoughts (Each expert responds and refines)\n- **Value Maximization Expert**: \"Building on the group's input, let's calculate potential net value. If we offer 4 Sheep (value portion of 12) for 2 Ore (value portion of 33), we'd gain more value (e.g., net gain of about 10-15 based on ratios). This aligns with the Opportunity Seizing Expert's observation about Player 0's preferences. We must ensure this increases our total to over 89.\"\n  \n- **Resource Balance Expert**: \"I agree with the Value Maximization Expert's idea, but we need to check balances: Offering 4 Sheep leaves us with 14, which is still plenty. However, if we request Ore, we'll go to 9 qty, which is good for balance. Let's avoid offering Brick since we're down to 1\u2014 that would be risky and could lead to us leaving the game disadvantaged.\"\n  \n- **Opportunity Seizing Expert**: \"Yes, Player 0 rejected our last offer with Wheat and accepted one with Sheep, so let's leverage that. Proposing 4 Sheep for 2 Ore could work, as it's aggressive but based on patterns. If they reject, we haven't lost much since Sheep is abundant.\"\n\nNo expert has realized they're wrong, so they proceed to Step 3.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Recommendations (Each expert concludes and decides on action)\n- **Value Maximization Expert**: \"After reviewing, a trade like [Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore] would net us value (Sheep value ~3-4 per unit vs. Ore's higher value), pushing total to ~102. This is optimal\u2014let's go with it. If rejected, we can reassess.\"\n  \n- **Resource Balance Expert**: \"This proposal keeps us balanced\u2014Sheep at 14 after trade, Ore at 9. It's sustainable, so I'm on board. No red flags here.\"\n  \n- **Opportunity Seizing Expert**: \"This fits Player 0's patterns and seizes the moment. I'm fully supportive.\"\n\nAll experts agree, so they conclude the analysis without anyone leaving.\n\n---\n\n### My Decision as Player 1:\nBased on the experts' analysis, the consensus is to propose a trade that maximizes value while maintaining balance and seizing opportunities. I'll make the following offer to Player 0.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "Given the current situation and trading dynamics, let\u2019s analyze the trading strategies from the perspectives of three different experts: an Economist, a Strategist, and a Risk Analyst.\n\n### Expert 1: Economist\n**Analysis**: The primary goal is to maximize the total value of resources. Currently, I have the following totals:\n- **Wheat**: 24 x 5 = 120\n- **Wood**: 15 x 10 = 150\n- **Sheep**: 7 x 13 = 91\n- **Brick**: 15 x 27 = 405\n- **Ore**: 16 x 38 = 608\n- **Total Value**: 120 + 150 + 91 + 405 + 608 = 1374\n\n**Recommendation**: To increase the total value, I should focus on trading the relatively lower-value resources (Sheep, Wheat) for higher-value resources (Brick, Ore). Therefore, I should aim to make offers that maximize the conversion rate of my low-value resources into high-value ones.\n\n### Expert 2: Strategist\n**Analysis**: It's important to analyze what resources Player 1 is likely to want and what I can afford to give away. From previous trades, Player 1 seems to be eager for Brick and Ore. \n\n**Recommendation**: I should be more conservative and not offer too many high-value resources unless absolutely necessary. I shouldn't offer my Ore too easily, as it's quite valuable. I recommend proposing trades that include Sheep or Wheat, which I have in surplus, in exchange for Brick and Ore.\n\n### Expert 3: Risk Analyst\n**Analysis**: The risk here is that I may be trading too many resources that I might need in future trades. I want to ensure that in each trade, I am not left with a resource deficit that could hinder future negotiations.\n\n**Recommendation**: I should keep a careful balance of resources, ideally retaining some key resources like Brick and Ore, which are highly valued. When trading, I should think about how Player 1 may react and how that could limit my options in subsequent turns.\n\n### Next Steps\nBased on these expert recommendations, I currently have:\n- **After the last trade**: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 15 Wood, 10 Brick, 14 Ore remain.\n- To optimize for value maximization, I will:\n  - Offer: [Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 6 Brick] (This aims to improve my Brick total since it is a high-value resource).\n\n**Trade Proposal**:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 6 Brick]",
