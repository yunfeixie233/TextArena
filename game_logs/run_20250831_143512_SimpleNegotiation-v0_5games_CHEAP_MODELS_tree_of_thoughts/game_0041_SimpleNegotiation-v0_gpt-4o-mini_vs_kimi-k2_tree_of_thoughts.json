      "response": "Let's introduce three different trading experts who will guide you through the negotiation process:\n\n### Expert 1: Resource Valuator\n**Step 1:** \nAssess the current values of your resources and compare them with the values of typical trades in the game. Here\u2019s what I observe:\n- Sheep (20 total) at a total value of 360 (20 * 18).\n- Ore (16 total) at a total value of 624 (16 * 39).\n- Brick (24 total) at a total value of 480 (24 * 20).\n\nIn the current trade offer, you're offering good resources (3 Sheep and 2 Ore) for Brick. However, Brick's total value is less than what you're offering. It's essential to find trades where you can receive higher-value resources than what you give up.\n\n### Expert 2: Negotiation Strategist\n**Step 1:** \nDevelop a strategy for the next offer. Since Player 1 has rejected the offer, it\u2019s clear they either don\u2019t value what you proposed or are not interested. I think you should try to leverage resources that are overvalued in upcoming trades.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on increasing your stock of Wheat, Wood, or Brick, which are typically valuable. I recommend that you offer a combination of resources that aren't critical to your current needs, ensuring you maximize value. \n\n### Expert 3: Demand Analyzer\n**Step 1:** \nLook at the potential trades Player 1 might prefer based on common strategies. Player 1 may need resources that you have in abundance (like Sheep or Brick). Instead of insisting on the Brick, consider providing combinations involving Sheep or a mix of other resources to attract a more favorable deal.\n\nI suggest watching Player 1's past trading patterns, maybe they have shown interest in resources that can help them build or expand, like Ore or Wheat.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. From Expert 1: I need to explore a new offer that minimizes the loss in overall resource value.\n2. From Expert 2: I will propose a new offer focusing on underperforming resources for higher-valued options.\n3. From Expert 3: I will analyze potential needs or previous trades of Player 1 to adjust my offerings effectively.\n\nLet's proceed with a new trade offer based on this analysis.\n\n### Proposed New Offer\n**[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 6 Brick, 3 Wheat]**",

      "response": "Let's analyze the situation and proceed with a trading strategy for Player 0, keeping in mind the goal to maximize the total value of resources.\n\n### Expert Perspectives:\n\n**Expert 1: Resource Value Specialist**  \n*Focused on maximizing the value per resource traded.*\n\n1. **Current Status**: I have the following resources:  \n   - Wheat: 13 x 5 = 65  \n   - Wood: 7 x 9 = 63  \n   - Sheep: 20 x 18 = 360  \n   - Brick: 24 x 20 = 480  \n   - Ore: 16 x 39 = 624  \n   - **Total Value**: 1,592\n\n2. **Trade Offer Analysis**: \n   - The recent offer from Player 1 (3 Sheep, 2 Ore for 5 Brick, 2 Sheep) was rejected. From my perspective, this trade doesn\u2019t seem valuable because I am giving away higher-value resources (Ore and Sheep) for lower-value resources (Brick).\n   - Need to focus on trading low-value resources for high-value resources.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: Strategic Expansion Specialist**  \n*Focuses on long-term resource accumulation and diversification.*\n\n1. **Current Strategy**: Aim for diversification and resource accumulation strategies that will allow me to handle multiple future trades effectively.\n   \n2. **Potential Resources**:\n   - High demand for Brick and Wheat as they can be seen as resource bases for growth.\n\n3. **Trade Offer Suggestions**:\n   - Rather than taking from Player 1, I could consider more beneficial trades or waiting for better offers if they arise in the coming turns.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: Aggressive Trader**  \n*Focuses on making faster trades to rapidly increase resource bases.*\n\n1. **Immediate Needs**: I should not continue to offer trades that have already been declined multiple times.\n   \n2. **New Trade Strategy**:\n   - Consider offering resources that I have in excess, specifically Sheep and potentially Wood, for a combination of Brick and Wheat or Ore.\n   \n---\n\n### Next Steps for Player 0:\nSince all the previous offers to Player 1 have been rejected, it's crucial to think creatively. I should look for an alternate strategy.\n\n1. **Make a New Offer**:\n   - I will propose a new offer that could attract Player 1 or other players. \n   - **New Offer**: [Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 10 Brick, 2 Wheat]\n\nThis offer intends to provide a more attractive trade for Player 1 by focusing on getting both Brick and Wheat while relieving my excess Sheep and some Wood.\n\n### Final Trade Decision for Turn:\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 10 Brick, 2 Wheat]",
