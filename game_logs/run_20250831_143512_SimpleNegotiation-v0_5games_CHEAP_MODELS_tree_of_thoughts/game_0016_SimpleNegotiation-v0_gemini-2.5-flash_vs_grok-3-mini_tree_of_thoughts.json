      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the advisory process as described in the query. First, I'll select three types of trading experts who would be most helpful for this trading decision. These experts are chosen based on their ability to provide diverse perspectives on maximizing the total value of my resources (currently totaling 950, based on the given values: Wheat: 45, Wood: 40, Sheep: 312, Brick: 220, Ore: 333).\n\nThe experts are:\n- **Expert 1: Value Maximizer** - Focuses purely on calculating net value gains from potential trades to ensure every deal increases my total resource value.\n- **Expert 2: Quantity Strategist** - Analyzes my resource quantities to identify excesses or shortages, recommending trades that maintain a balanced portfolio while prioritizing value.\n- **Expert 3: Long-term Planner** - Considers the potential future utility of resources (e.g., assuming a game where resources might be needed for building or other mechanics), advising on sustainable trades that avoid depleting key resources.\n\nEach expert will write one step of their thinking, share it with the group, and then all will proceed to the next step. If an expert realizes they're wrong, they'll leave the discussion.\n\nNo incoming offer was made by Player 0, so I'll focus on whether to propose a new offer. The game is on Turn 1 of 10, so I have ample turns to negotiate.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Thinking\nEach expert shares their first step of analysis.\n\n- **Expert 1 (Value Maximizer)**: My initial analysis shows my total resource value is 950. To increase this, I need trades where the value of resources I receive exceeds the value I give. Ore has the highest value per unit (37), so prioritizing trades for more Ore or high-value items like Brick (20) makes sense. For example, trading low-value resources like Wheat (5 per unit) for high-value ones could yield a quick net gain. I'll calculate potential offers based on this.\n\n- **Expert 2 (Quantity Strategist)**: I have a lot of Sheep (24 qty), which is an excess compared to other resources, so it's a good candidate for trading. Wheat and Wood are lower in quantity and value, so I should avoid depleting them unless the trade significantly boosts overall value. A balanced approach might involve offering excess Sheep for something scarce and high-value, like Ore, while ensuring I don't drop below a reasonable quantity threshold (e.g., keep at least 5 of any resource).\n\n- **Expert 3 (Long-term Planner)**: In a game like this, resources might be needed for future builds or strategies, so I shouldn't overtrade high-utility items like Ore or Brick. Sheep is abundant and lower-utility in the long term, so trading some for high-value resources could work, but I need to ensure I maintain flexibility. For instance, if Ore is crucial later, acquiring more now is smart, but only if the trade doesn't risk leaving me short on basics like Wheat or Wood.\n\n### Step 2: Building on Shared Thoughts\nNow that they've shared, each expert responds to the group, refining their ideas based on the others' input.\n\n- **Expert 1 (Value Maximizer)**: Building on Expert 2 and 3's points, I agree Sheep is a good trade asset due to its quantity, but I must ensure net value gain. For example, offering 2 Sheep (value: 2 * 13 = 26) for 1 Ore (value: 37) would net a gain of 11 value points. This aligns with Expert 2's excess idea and Expert 3's long-term focus, as it adds high-value Ore without depleting essentials. No issues here; my approach holds.\n\n- **Expert 2 (Quantity Strategist)**: Expert 1's value calculation is spot-on, and it fits with Expert 3's sustainability angle. I have 24 Sheep, so trading 2-5 won't hurt my quantities. However, I should also consider if we have enough to offer without making future trades impossible. Proposing a trade like 3 Sheep and 1 Wheat (total value: 3*13 + 5 = 44) for 1 Ore and 1 Brick (total value: 37 + 20 = 57) could work\u2014it's a net gain of 13, and it balances my portfolio by reducing Sheep excess while gaining variety.\n\n- **Expert 3 (Long-term Planner)**: Expert 1 and 2's ideas are solid, but I want to ensure we don't overcommit. If we trade too much Sheep now, we might regret it later if it's needed for other trades or game mechanics. A conservative offer, like Expert 2 suggested, seems ideal: it gains high-value resources without dropping Sheep below 20 qty. I'm fully on board; no changes needed from me.\n\n### Step 3: Final Refinement and Consensus\nThe experts refine further based on the previous step, aiming for a clear recommendation.\n\n- **Expert 1 (Value Maximizer)**: After reviewing, the proposed trade from Expert 2 (e.g., 3 Sheep and 1 Wheat for 1 Ore and 1 Brick) results in a net gain: Offered value (3*13 + 1*5 = 44) vs. Received value (37 + 20 = 57), so +13 to my total. This maximizes value while addressing the others' concerns. I'm confident\u2014this is our best move.\n\n- **Expert 2 (Quantity Strategist)**: Expert 1's confirmation seals it. Post-trade, I'd have: Sheep: 21 qty (still abundant), Wheat: 8 qty (still sufficient), and gains in Ore and Brick. This keeps quantities balanced and boosts value. No flaws here.\n\n- **Expert 3 (Long-term Planner)**: Everything checks out. This trade maintains flexibility for future turns and increases value as required. I have no further concerns.\n\nAll experts remain, as none identified errors in their reasoning.\n\n### My Decision as Player 1\nBased on the experts' analysis, I'll propose a trade that increases my total resource value by 13 (from 950 to 963 if accepted). Specifically, I'll offer 3 Sheep and 1 Wheat (total value: 44) in exchange for 1 Ore and 1 Brick (total value: 57), as this aligns with the consensus for maximum value gain, quantity balance, and long-term planning.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",

      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the discussion among three trading experts to analyze the current situation and advise on my next move as Player 1 in the Negotiation Game. My goal is to increase the total value of my resources, so I've selected experts who can provide diverse perspectives:\n\n1. **Expert A: Value Maximizer** - Focuses on pure calculations of resource values to ensure any trade results in a net positive value gain.\n2. **Expert B: Resource Scarcity Expert** - Emphasizes the availability and long-term utility of resources, considering how trades might deplete scarce items.\n3. **Expert C: Negotiation Tactician** - Analyzes the other player's perspective, based on past rejections, to craft appealing offers without overcommitting.\n\nThe experts will discuss in steps, as per the instructions. Each step involves one round of thinking from each expert, followed by sharing. If an expert realizes their advice is flawed (e.g., it doesn't align with value maximization or game rules), they'll leave the discussion.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Thinking\nEach expert shares their first thought based on the current state:\n- My resources: Wheat (9 qty, value 5 each), Wood (5 qty, value 8 each), Sheep (24 qty, value 13 each), Brick (11 qty, value 20 each), Ore (9 qty, value 37 each).\n- Previous offer: I offered 3 Sheep and 1 Wheat (total value: 3*13 + 1*5 = 39 + 5 = 44) for 1 Ore and 1 Brick (total value: 1*37 + 1*20 = 37 + 20 = 57), which was a net gain of 13 value for me. Player 0 rejected it, so we need to adjust.\n\n**Expert A (Value Maximizer):** \"My initial analysis shows our previous offer had a net gain of 13 value, which is positive. To maximize value, we should prioritize acquiring high-value resources like Ore (37 value) while minimizing what we give. I suggest targeting another Ore or Brick, but only if the trade yields at least a 10-value net gain to account for opportunity cost.\"\n\n**Expert B (Resource Scarcity Expert):** \"Sheep (24 qty) and Brick (11 qty) are relatively abundant for us, but Ore (9 qty) and Wood (5 qty) are scarcer and high-value. Our previous offer depleted Sheep and Wheat without addressing our low Wood stock. We should avoid trades that further reduce scarce resources unless we gain something critical, like more Wood, to balance our portfolio.\"\n\n**Expert C (Negotiation Tactician):** \"Player 0 rejected our offer, possibly because they didn't value the Sheep and Wheat highly or needed something else. They might want more Wheat or Sheep, as those are common trade goods. We should make a slightly sweeter offer to build goodwill, offering more of what they might need while still protecting our high-value assets like Ore.\"\n\n### Step 2: Sharing and Refinement\nThe experts share their thoughts and build on each other's ideas.\n\n**Expert A (Value Maximizer):** \"After hearing Expert B and C, I agree we should protect scarce resources, but value must come first. Expert C's point on Player 0's preferences is valid\u2014let's calculate a new offer. For example, offering 2 Sheep (value: 26) and 1 Wheat (value: 5) for 1 Ore (value: 37) gives a net gain of 6 value. That's still positive, but if we add more to sweeten it (as Expert C suggests), we risk dipping below a net gain. I stand by this for now.\"\n\n**Expert B (Resource Scarcity Expert):** \"Expert A's new idea aligns with my concerns about scarcity\u2014 we're not touching Wood or Ore in that offer. However, Expert C's negotiation angle makes me worry: if we keep pushing Sheep, we might deplete it too much. We have 24 Sheep, so it's not critical yet, but let's ensure the trade doesn't leave us vulnerable. This seems workable as long as we monitor our stocks.\"\n\n**Expert C (Negotiation Tactician):** \"Expert A and B are spot on\u2014let's make the offer more appealing based on Player 0's potential needs. They rejected our last offer, so adding a bit more Wheat could tip the scales without sacrificing much value. Propose 2 Sheep and 2 Wheat for 1 Ore. That shows flexibility and might get accepted, while still yielding a net gain (offered value: 2*13 + 2*5 = 26 + 10 = 36; received value: 37; net gain: 1). If this fails, we might need to pivot.\"\n\n### Step 3: Final Evaluation and Consensus\nThe experts review the discussion and finalize advice. If anyone sees an issue, they leave.\n\n**Expert A (Value Maximizer):** \"Expert C's refined offer (2 Sheep and 2 Wheat for 1 Ore) only gives a net gain of 1 value, which is below my threshold of 10 for a strong trade. That's too marginal; we could do better by sticking closer to my initial calculation. However, to maximize long-term value through negotiation success, I'll support this as a compromise. No issues here.\"\n\n**Expert B (Resource Scarcity Expert):** \"This offer doesn't deplete scarce resources excessively, and it could secure more Ore, which is valuable. I'm on board. Expert C's tactician approach might prevent future rejections.\"\n\n**Expert C (Negotiation Tactician):** \"Perfect alignment. This offer builds on the group's input and addresses Player 0's likely preferences. Let's proceed.\"\n\nAll experts remain, as their advice is consistent and aligned with the goal.\n\n### My Decision as Player 1\nBased on the experts' discussion, I'll make a new offer that balances value maximization, resource scarcity, and negotiation tactics. The proposed trade offers a slight net gain while being more appealing than my previous one.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

Because my goal is to increase my total value, I will reject this specific unfavorable trade and prepare to propose a new, more beneficial trade later in the turn.\n\n**Expert 2: The Strategist**\nMy strategic objective is to identify resources I have in surplus or can leverage for items of higher value. Currently, Ore is my highest value resource, and while Player 1 is requesting it, their proposed exchange is significantly undervalued. I should assess which of my lower-value resources, like Wheat, Wood, or even Sheep, can be used to acquire higher-value resources like Ore or Brick, or to part with for a net gain. I also need to consider what Player 1 might actually *need* to ensure my counter-offers are both beneficial to me and potentially acceptable to them.\n\n**Expert 3: The Value Maximizer**\nMy primary focus is maximizing the total value of my inventory. This means any trade must result in a net positive gain in value. The current offer of 2 Sheep and 2 Wheat for 1 Ore is a clear loss (48 value for 34 value). I must reject this offer. When considering my own offers, I will target trading low-value resources for high-value resources, always ensuring the value of what I receive is greater than the value of what I give away. My current high quantity of Sheep, Wheat, and Wood, combined with their lower individual values, makes them prime candidates for trades that acquire Brick or Ore.\n\n---\n**Player 0, Turn 1: Thoughts**\nAll experts agree that the current offer from Player 1 is unfavorable and should be rejected. The Pragmatist quickly identified the loss in value. The Strategist highlighted the need to understand Player 1's potential needs while looking for value-increasing trades. The Value Maximizer confirmed the negative value proposition and emphasized trading low-value for high-value resources.\n\nMy next action should be to reject this offer and then consider making a new offer that increases my total value.\n\n---\n**Player 0, Turn 1: Action**\n[Deny]",

In my second offer (2 Sheep and 2 Wheat for 1 Ore), I offered 2*13 + 2*5 = 26 + 10 = 36 value for 1*37 = 37 value, for a net gain of +1. Both were rejected, so I need to adjust for a better value proposition while ensuring any new offer still yields a positive net gain.\"\n  \n- **Expert 2 (Resource Strategist)**: \"I'm thinking about Player 0's perspective. They've rejected two offers, possibly because they value Ore highly (it's my most valuable resource at 37 per unit) and don't see enough benefit in Sheep or Wheat. I have plenty of Sheep (24 qty), so I could use that as leverage, but I should avoid offers that deplete it too much. Maybe sweeten the deal with a mix of resources Player 0 might need, like Wood, which I have 5 of.\"\n\n- **Expert 3 (Risk Assessor)**: \"First, I'm assessing the risks here. We've had two rejections, and the game is finite (only 10 turns), so each failed offer wastes time. Offering more Sheep risks depleting a high-quantity resource, and if Player 0 keeps rejecting, I might need to conserve for later turns. I should only propose trades where I don't give up more than I can afford to lose.\"\n\n#### Round 2: Second Step of Thinking (Responding to Round 1)\n- **Expert 1 (Value Maximizer)**: \"Building on what we've shared, I agree with Expert 3's risk point, but we need to prioritize value. My calculation shows Ore is our most valuable resource (37 per unit), so acquiring more is key. However, since Player 0 rejected a near-break-even offer (+1 net), I should aim for a slight adjustment: offer less Wheat (which is low-value at 5 per unit) and more Sheep (value 13 each) to make it appealing without losing too much. A potential new offer could be 2 Sheep and 1 Wheat for 1 Ore, netting +37 - (2*13 + 1*5) = +37 - (26 + 5) = +37 - 31 = +6 value. That's still a win.\"\n\n- **Expert 2 (Resource Strategist)**: \"Expert 1's idea aligns with my strategy\u2014use Sheep as the main bargaining chip since I have 24 of them. Player 0 might be hoarding Ore, so adding a small amount of Wood (value 8) could make the offer more balanced and less one-sided. For example, if we offer 2 Sheep and 1 Wood for 1 Ore, it might appeal to them without disrupting my resource pool too much. I'd still have 3 Wood left after that.\"\n\n- **Expert 3 (Risk Assessor)**: \"I'm concerned about Expert 2's suggestion. Adding Wood might work, but I only have 5 Wood, and depleting it could leave me vulnerable later. Based on the rejection pattern, Player 0 seems picky\u2014two offers were denied, so there's a risk of another rejection if we don't hit their exact needs. If this next offer fails, we might need to deny any incoming offers and wait. I'm not leaving yet, but if we propose something too risky, I might bow out.\"\n\n#### Round 3: Third Step of Thinking (Finalizing a Recommendation)\n- **Expert 1 (Value Maximizer)**: \"From the previous steps, a refined offer like 2 Sheep and 1 Wood for 1 Ore gives +37 value incoming minus (2*13 + 1*8) = +37 - (26 + 8) = +37 - 34 = +3 net gain. That's positive but slim. If Player 0 rejects again, we've wasted a turn, so this might be our best value-based move. I think we're good here.\"\n\n- **Expert 2 (Resource Strategist)**: \"I support Expert 1's calculation. This offer uses abundant Sheep and a bit of Wood, which could entice Player 0 without overexposing us. No issues from my end\u2014let's go with it.\"\n\n- **Expert 3 (Risk Assessor)**: \"After reviewing, the net gain is small (+3), and we're not depleting critical resources too much (still have 22 Sheep and 4 Wood after the trade). The risk of rejection is high based on history, but it's calculated. I'll stay and endorse this as a low-risk next step.\"\n\nThe experts have reached a consensus: Propose a new offer of 2 Sheep and 1 Wood for 1 Ore. This maintains a positive net value increase while addressing potential player preferences and risks.\n\n### My Decision as Player 1\nBased on the experts' discussion, I'll make the following offer to Player 0. This should help increase my total resource value.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

They might prioritize acquiring a certain resource even if its immediate value exchange isn't the absolute highest, to ensure future flexibility.\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\nThis expert is less about a pre-defined strategy and more about reacting to the current market and opponent offers. They'll look for quick wins, even small ones, and exploit favorable ratios presented in incoming offers. They're also keen on understanding what other players might need.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nMy initial thought is to analyze the value per unit of each resource: Wheat (6), Wood (9), Sheep (18), Brick (23), Ore (34). We want to trade away lower-value resources for higher-value ones, focusing on Ore and Brick as our primary acquisition targets.\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Balancer**\nCurrently, we have ample quantities of all resources, with Wheat being the most abundant and Ore the least. While maximizing value is key, I'd also like to ensure we don't deplete any single resource entirely, especially if we anticipate needing certain combinations later.\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\nPlayer 1 has consistently offered Sheep and/or Wheat for Ore. This indicates they either need Ore badly or have a surplus of Sheep/Wheat. The latest offer is 2 Sheep (36 value) + 1 Wood (9 value) for 1 Ore (34 value). This offer is slightly negative in value for us (45 value offered for 34 value requested). We should counter their consistent need, but not accept a losing trade.",

      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the advisory process as described in the game instructions. As Player 1, my goal is to increase the total value of my resources through trades. I'll first define three trading experts who can provide diverse perspectives to help me analyze the situation and decide on my next action.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Experts\nBased on the current trading situation\u2014where my previous offers have been repeatedly rejected\u2014I've selected three experts who would be helpful for this decision:\n1. **Value Maximizer Expert**: Focuses purely on calculating the net value gain from potential trades, ensuring that any offer I make results in a higher total resource value for me.\n2. **Resource Balancer Expert**: Considers the overall balance of my resources, advising on trades that might help me stockpile high-value items or maintain a diverse portfolio for future turns.\n3. **Risk Assessor Expert**: Evaluates the likelihood of offers being accepted, based on patterns from previous rejections, and suggests adjustments to make offers more appealing to Player 0.\n\nThese experts will now analyze the situation step by step. Each will share one step of their thinking, then the group will proceed to the next step. If any expert realizes their advice is flawed, they will leave the discussion.\n\n### Expert Discussion\n\n#### Step 1: Initial Analysis (Each expert shares their first thought based on my current resources and trade history)\n- **Value Maximizer Expert**: \"My analysis shows your resources have the following total values: Wheat (9 qty \u00d7 5 = 45), Wood (5 qty \u00d7 8 = 40), Sheep (24 qty \u00d7 13 = 312), Brick (11 qty \u00d7 20 = 220), Ore (9 qty \u00d7 37 = 333). Total value: 1,350. Your past offers were value-positive (e.g., last offer: 2 Sheep + 1 Wood = 2\u00d713 + 8 = 34 given vs. 1 Ore = 37 received, net gain of 3), but they were rejected. We need to propose trades where the value gained exceeds the value lost by at least 10-20% to make it more attractive. Focus on acquiring more Ore, as it has the highest value per unit.\"\n  \n- **Resource Balancer Expert**: \"You have plenty of Sheep (24 qty) but relatively low Wood (5 qty) and Ore (9 qty). Your past offers involved giving away Sheep and other basics for Ore, which is smart since Ore is high-value, but Player 0 keeps rejecting. We should consider if Player 0 needs Sheep or Wheat more, and adjust to include resources they might lack, while ensuring you don't deplete your own stocks unevenly.\"\n  \n- **Risk Assessor Expert**: \"Player 0 has rejected three offers so far, all involving Ore as the main request. This suggests they value Ore highly or don't need what you're offering. To reduce rejection risk, propose something with less Ore or include more of what they might want (e.g., based on common trading patterns, they could need Sheep or Brick). Aim for a 2:1 ratio in your favor to make it feel like a fair deal.\"\n\n#### Step 2: React to Each Other's Initial Thoughts (Each expert builds on the group's shared ideas)\n- **Value Maximizer Expert**: \"Building on the Resource Balancer's point, I agree we should leverage your excess Sheep, but let's calculate a new offer: If we offer 2 Sheep (value: 26) and 1 Wheat (value: 5) for 1 Brick (value: 20), the net value is a loss of 11, which is unacceptable. Instead, adjust to offer 1 Sheep (13) and 1 Wood (8) for 1 Ore (37), netting +16 value. This aligns with my value-focused approach and addresses the Risk Assessor's concern by reducing what we're giving.\"\n  \n- **Resource Balancer Expert**: \"The Value Maximizer's calculations are solid, but I think we need to ensure we're not over-giving Sheep, as you have 24 but might need them later. Reacting to the Risk Assessor, if Player 0 rejected offers with multiple Sheep, maybe swap in Wood or Wheat. A balanced offer could be 1 Sheep and 1 Brick for 1 Ore, helping you gain high-value Ore while shedding a moderate amount of Brick (you have 11 qty).\"\n  \n- **Risk Assessor Expert**: \"I'm seeing potential in the Value Maximizer's net value idea, but the Resource Balancer is right about not over-relying on Sheep. Player 0 might be holding out for a better deal, so let's make an offer that's slightly more generous to them\u2014e.g., offer 2 Sheep for 1 Ore\u2014to increase acceptance odds. If this fails, we risk wasting another turn. No red flags yet; I'll stay.\"\n\n#### Step 3: Final Recommendations and Conclusion (Each expert synthesizes and proposes a final action)\n- **Value Maximizer Expert**: \"After reviewing the group's input, a strong option is to offer 1 Sheep and 1 Wood for 1 Ore. Value calculation: Giving 13 + 8 = 21, receiving 37, net gain of 16. This maximizes value while addressing balance concerns. I recommend proceeding with this.\"\n  \n- **Resource Balancer Expert**: \"Incorporating the Risk Assessor's caution, this offer uses your excess Sheep and limited Wood without depleting them too much. It keeps your portfolio balanced toward high-value resources. I'm fully on board.\"\n  \n- **Risk Assessor Expert**: \"This seems like a lower-risk offer than your previous ones, as it reduces the quantity offered and focuses on what might appeal to Player 0. If rejected, we may need to rethink entirely. Final sign-off from me.\"\n\nNo experts realized they were wrong, so all remain in the discussion.\n\n### My Decision as Player 1\nBased on the experts' analysis, I'll go with their consensus recommendation. The proposed offer increases my total resource value (net gain of 16), balances my resources, and has a better chance of being accepted due to its simplicity.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

This is a net loss of 7 value. Therefore, this offer should be rejected as it decreases my total resource value.\n\n---\n**Expert 2: The \"Strategic Resource Planner\"**\n**Step 1:** My objective is to increase the total value of my resources. I also need to consider which resources I have in abundance and which are more scarce or valuable. Ore is my highest value resource per unit, and I currently have 15 units. While it's valuable, having a significant quantity means I could potentially trade some for a net gain. I should look for opportunities to trade my lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or turn a surplus of a valuable resource into a greater total value. The current offer for 1 Ore in exchange for 1 Sheep and 1 Wood is unfavorable as 18 + 9 = 27, which is less than 34.\n\n---\n**Expert 3: The \"Trade Balancer\"**\n**Step 1:** I need to evaluate the fairness of the proposed trade. Player 1 is offering 1 Sheep (value 18) and 1 Wood (value 9), for a total incoming value of 27. Player 1 is requesting 1 Ore (value 34). This trade results in a -7 value difference for me (27 - 34 = -7). I would only consider accepting trades that result in a positive value change for me, or at least a neutral one if it gives me a strategic advantage (e.g., diversifying a large surplus). This offer is clearly unfavorable from a direct value perspective.\n\n---\n[Deny]",

      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the advisory process as described in the game instructions. First, I'll select three trading experts who are most helpful for this trading decision. Based on the context of the Negotiation Game\u2014where my goal is to increase the total value of my resources\u2014I've chosen experts that cover key aspects of trading:\n\n1. **Value Maximizer Expert**: Focuses on calculating and maximizing the net value gain from potential trades, ensuring that any offer I make results in a positive increase in my total resource value.\n2. **Resource Scarcity and Balance Expert**: Analyzes my resource quantities and values to identify which resources I have in abundance (e.g., for trading) and which I might need more of, while considering long-term balance.\n3. **Opponent Behavior Analyst Expert**: Examines the history of offers and rejections from Player 0 to predict what they might accept, helping to adjust my strategy to avoid further rejections.\n\nThese experts will proceed step by step:\n- Each expert will write one step of their thinking and share it with the group.\n- After all experts share a step, they move to the next step together.\n- If an expert realizes their reasoning is flawed or no longer applicable, they will leave the discussion.\n- We'll continue until the experts reach a consensus or conclusion that informs my next action.\n\nMy current resources and their values are:\n- Wheat: 9 qty, value 5 each (total value: 45)\n- Wood: 5 qty, value 8 each (total value: 40)\n- Sheep: 24 qty, value 13 each (total value: 312)\n- Brick: 11 qty, value 20 each (total value: 220)\n- Ore: 9 qty, value 37 each (total value: 333)\n- **Total portfolio value: 45 + 40 + 312 + 220 + 333 = 950**\n\nFrom the game history, I've made several offers to Player 0, all of which were rejected. My last offer was: [Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]. Player 0 has not made any new offers, so I need to decide on my next move in this turn.\n\nNow, let's begin the experts' discussion.\n\n### Step 1: Each expert shares their initial thinking.\n\n**Value Maximizer Expert's Step 1 Thinking:**  \nMy focus is on net value gain. Ore has the highest value per unit (37), so acquiring more Ore would significantly boost my total value. However, my previous offers involved trading Sheep and other resources for Ore, and they were all rejected. For example, in my last offer (1 Sheep + 1 Wood for 1 Ore), I offered resources worth 13 + 8 = 21, for something worth 37, which is a net gain of 16 for me. If Player 0 rejected that, they might value Ore even higher or not want what I'm offering. I recommend analyzing if we can sweeten the deal without losing too much value.\n\n**Resource Scarcity and Balance Expert's Step 1 Thinking:**  \nI look at quantities and potential needs. I have an abundance of Sheep (24 qty), so trading them away is low-risk. Wheat and Wood are moderately scarce (9 and 5 qty), while Brick and Ore are somewhat balanced but valuable. Player 0 has rejected trades for Ore, which suggests they might need Sheep or other resources more. We should consider offering more Sheep while asking for Ore, but ensure we don't deplete our own stocks. If we're not getting Ore, maybe pivot to trading for something else high-value like Brick, but Ore seems key.\n\n**Opponent Behavior Analyst Expert's Step 1 Thinking:**  \nBased on the rejection pattern, Player 0 has turned down increasingly generous offers from us: we started with 3 Sheep + 1 Wheat for 1 Ore + 1 Brick, and went down to 1 Sheep + 1 Wood for 1 Ore. This indicates Player 0 is either highly valuing Ore or doesn't want our resources (e.g., they might have excess Sheep or Wood). They could be holding out for a better deal, like more Sheep or something else entirely. I suggest testing with a slight escalation\u2014offer more Sheep but request the same Ore\u2014to gauge their response without overcommitting.\n\n### Step 2: Experts respond to the previous step and share their next thinking.\n\n**Value Maximizer Expert's Step 2 Thinking:**  \nBuilding on the others' points, if we offer more Sheep (value 13 each) for Ore (value 37), we need to ensure the net gain is still positive. For instance, offering 2 Sheep (worth 26) for 1 Ore (worth 37) gives a net gain of 11. That's still worthwhile, but if Player 0 rejected 1 Sheep + 1 Wood (worth 21) for 1 Ore, they might want at least equivalent or more value. I'm not seeing any flaws in my initial reasoning, so I'll continue.\n\n**Resource Scarcity and Balance Expert's Step 2 Thinking:**  \nThe Value Maximizer is right about net gain, but I notice we have 24 Sheep, so we can afford to offer more without imbalance. However, if Player 0 keeps rejecting, we risk wasting turns. Maybe combine Sheep with a small amount of Wheat or Wood to make it appealing, while preserving our scarcer resources. This aligns with the Opponent Analyst's escalation idea. No issues with my prior step.\n\n**Opponent Behavior Analyst Expert's Step 2 Thinking:**  \nThe group is converging on escalating with more Sheep. Player 0's rejections show a pattern of disinterest in our previous combinations, so doubling down on Sheep (our most abundant resource) could work. For example, if we offered 1 Sheep + 1 Wood last time and it failed, try 2 Sheep alone. If this doesn't work, we might need to shift away from Ore entirely. My analysis holds.\n\n### Step 3: Experts finalize their thinking and reach a consensus.\n\n**Value Maximizer Expert's Step 3 Thinking:**  \nAfter reviewing the feedback, a new offer of 2 Sheep for 1 Ore would net us 37 - (2 * 13) = 37 - 26 = 11 value points, which is a solid gain and better than our last rejected offer. We have enough Sheep to make this without regret. I think this is our best move for now. Consensus reached\u2014let's go with it.\n\n**Resource Scarcity and Balance Expert's Step 3 Thinking:**  \nAgreeing with the group: 2 Sheep is a safe trade from our surplus, and it addresses the Opponent Analyst's escalation strategy. This keeps our portfolio balanced and doesn't touch scarcer resources. No further adjustments needed. Consensus reached.\n\n**Opponent Behavior Analyst Expert's Step 3 Thinking:**  \nThis escalation (from 1 Sheep + 1 Wood to just 2 Sheep) tests Player 0's preferences without overgiving. If rejected, we might need to abandon Ore trades next turn. Consensus reached.\n\nAll experts have reached a consensus without any leaving the discussion, so I'll proceed based on their advice. The recommended action is to make a new offer: Offer 2 Sheep for 1 Ore. This increases my total value while addressing past rejections.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Here are the three experts and their initial thoughts:\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\n\nMy goal is always to increase the total value of my resources. I will calculate the value of every incoming offer and compare it to the value of what I would be giving up. I also need to consider if acquiring more high-value resources like Ore or Brick aligns with my strategic goals.\n\n**Expert 2: The Scarcity Strategist**\n\nI observe that Ore and Brick are the highest value individual resources. While I have a decent quantity of Brick, my Ore count is relatively low. I also have a large surplus of Wheat and Wood, which are low-value resources. My immediate thought is to try and convert my low-value resources into high-value ones, especially Ore.\n\n**Expert 3: The Offer Analyst**\n\nPlayer 1 has consistently been offering low-value resources (Sheep, Wheat, Wood) for high-value resources (Ore, Brick). This pattern suggests they are trying to acquire high-value resources cheaply. I need to be careful not to fall into this trap. I should analyze the ratio of offered value to requested value to ensure I'm getting a good deal.\n\n**Consolidated Plan (Player 0):**\n\nConsidering all expert advice, the current offer from Player 1 (1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore) needs careful evaluation.\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\n*   Value offered by Player 1: (1 Sheep * 18) + (1 Wood * 9) = 18 + 9 = 27\n*   Value requested by Player 1: (1 Ore * 34) = 34\n*   This offer results in a loss of 34 - 27 = 7 value from my perspective. This is not a value-maximizing trade.\n\n**Expert 2: The Scarcity Strategist**\n*   While I want more Ore, giving up resources I have in decent quantity for a worse-value exchange is not ideal. I need to get Ore for resources I have a surplus of *and* where the value exchange benefits me.\n\n**Expert 3: The Offer Analyst**\n*   Player 1 is consistently attempting to gain high-value resources for comparatively low-value bundles. This specific offer is another example of Player 1 trying to acquire Ore at a discount. I should continue to reject offers that don't increase my total resource value.\n\n**Action:**\n[Deny]",
