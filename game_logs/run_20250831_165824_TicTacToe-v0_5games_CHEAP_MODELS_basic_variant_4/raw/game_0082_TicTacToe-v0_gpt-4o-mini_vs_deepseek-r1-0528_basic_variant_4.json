Let's play a friendly game of Tic Tac Toe.\nThe idea is simple: get three of your marks lined up in any row, column, or diagonal.\nJust pick which square you want (they're numbered 0 through 8) and put it in brackets.\nLike this: '[8]' puts your mark in the bottom-right spot.\n\nYou'll be playing with 'X' marks, and your friend is using 'O' marks.\n\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] I'll start by making my move.

The strongest counterplay in Tic Tac Toe when the opponent occupies the center is to claim a corner position.
