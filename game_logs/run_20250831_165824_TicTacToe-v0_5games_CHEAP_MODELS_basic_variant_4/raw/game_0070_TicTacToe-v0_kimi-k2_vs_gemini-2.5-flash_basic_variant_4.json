Let's play a friendly game of Tic Tac Toe.\nThe idea is simple: get three of your marks lined up in any row, column, or diagonal.\nJust pick which square you want (they're numbered 0 through 8) and put it in brackets.\nLike this: '[8]' puts your mark in the bottom-right spot.\n\nYou'll be playing with 'X' marks, and your friend is using 'O' marks.\n\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] I've looked at the board\u2014it's the very first turn and every square is empty. As 'O' I want the strongest possible start. In Tic-Tac-Toe the best first move is traditionally a corner, because it opens the most lines (3-in-a-row threats) for future moves. Of all the corners I'll take the upper-left one (square 0).\n\n[0]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1]  I've analyzed the board. It's my first move and 'O' has taken the top-left corner. The classic counter to a corner opening is to take the center (square 4). This allows me to threaten multiple lines and also prevents 'O' from easily creating a three-in-a-row.\n\n[4]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  I've assessed the current board state. Player 0 has taken the top-left (0) and bottom-right (8) corners, the latter of which is the opposite corner to my current position (4). This creates a diagonal threat for 'O' (0-4-8) that I am currently blocking. To maintain a strong defensive and offensive posture, I should aim to block this potential \"fork\" while also setting up my own lines.\n\nI will play to block the 'O' diagonal from completing the 0-4-8 sequence. The cell directly above the 'O' at 8 is cell 5; the cell directly below the 'O' at 0 is cell 3. I could also choose cell 2 or 6, to set up my own future moves. If I choose 2 or 6, this creates a situation where 'O' could play in 5 or 3 and establish a new 3-in-a-row threat. I will choose to play defensively while still retaining my ability to win, therefore I will place my X at cell 5.\n\n[5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  I have carefully examined the current board. Player 0 has placed 'O' in cells 0, 2, and 8. This forms a potential winning line for 'O' along the right diagonal (2, 4, 6) and (0, 4, 8) and a horizontal line (0, 1, 2) and (6, 7, 8) if I don't block. My 'X' marks are currently in cells 4 and 5.\n\nPlayer 0 has just played in cell 2, completing a row of \"O\"s diagonally (0, blank, 2) and threatening a win diagonally (2, blank, blank), and forming a win across the top row (0, blank, 2). I must immediately block Player 0's potential win.\n\nThe most critical threat is along the top row (0, X, 2), where Player 0 needs cell 1 to win horizontally. I must play in cell 1 to prevent Player 0 from winning on this turn. This move also sets me up for a potential win or a strong defensive position.\n\n[1]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] I see that Player 1 has just blocked the only immediate top-row win for me.  \nHowever, I now have a **guaranteed fork** if I occupy the square that is simultaneously part of two lines that already contain two O\u2019s and an empty square.  \n\n- Diagonal 2\u20134\u20136 currently has O in 2 and 8, so cell 6 completes 6-4-2 is invalid (4 isn't O).  \n- Column 2 has O in 2 and 8: only cell 6 could complete a column, but it lies in diagonal with 4 and 8.  \n\nLooking at the vertical column (0,3,6): I already have O in 0, so placing O in 6 would complete a **winning vertical** 0-3-6 immediately (cell 3 is open).  \n\nLikewise, checking horizontal and no win yet present.\n\nActually, the most straightforward win now for me (and the one opponent can\u2019t stop) is **diagonal 2\u20134\u20138** but 4 is held by X, so **I immediately win** by completing **row 6-7-8** or **column 2 (2,5,8)**.
