Player 1 could threaten a win by taking cell 2 (completing row 0: X-O-X), so I'll secure that position.\n\nAdditionally, I notice that taking cell 7 would give me two winning paths:\n1. Column 1 (cells 1-4-7) would become O-O-O\n2.

I notice that Player0 has a strong presence in the center and is setting up a potential win.

However, their next move was actually in cell7 (not cell2 as per my previous understanding), so the correct current state is:\n\n```\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n3 | O |5 \n---+---+---\n6 | O | X \n```\n\nAnd the available moves are derived from the corrected understanding of the game state.
