To counter 'O's strong presence and create a potential winning line or disrupt 'O's plans, I should aim to control a central or key peripheral position.\n\nOne strategic move is to place 'X' in position 7. This move has several benefits:\n1. It develops 'X's presence on the bottom row.\n2. It puts 'X' in a relatively safe position, as the bottom row is not immediately threatened by 'O'.\n3. It keeps options open for the next move, as positions 3, 5, and 6 are still available.\n\nHowever, let's examine other options:\n- Placing 'X' in position 3 could potentially create a fork or put pressure on 'O's central presence.\n- Placing 'X' in position 5 could be a good move as it is a central position and could potentially create a line or block 'O' from winning.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I think placing 'X' in position 3 is a good move as it puts pressure on 'O's position and opens up potential lines for 'X'.\n\nSo, my move is: [3]\n\nHere's the command: [3]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | X | O \n---+---+---\n X | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'",
