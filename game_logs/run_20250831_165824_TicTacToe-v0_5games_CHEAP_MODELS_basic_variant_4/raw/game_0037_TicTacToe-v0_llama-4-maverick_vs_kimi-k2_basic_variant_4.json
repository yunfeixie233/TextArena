Placing 'O' in positions 1, 3, 6, 7, or 8 doesn't immediately win the game.\n\n2. **Blocking the opponent's potential win**: I'll check if 'X' has a potential win. If 'X' gets to position 1 and 3, they could potentially win by getting three 'X's in a row (if they had two 'X's, which is not the case). However, I should be cautious about their potential next moves.\n\n3. **Strategic placement**: The current state of the board suggests that I should focus on controlling the center (already done with 'O' in position 4) and expanding my presence. \n\n4. **Choosing the next move**: Since I have 'O' in positions 2 and 4, a logical next step is to place 'O' in a position that could potentially set up a future win or block 'X' from winning. Position 8 is somewhat diagonal to my existing 'O' in position 2, and it is on the same diagonal as 'X' in position 0.
