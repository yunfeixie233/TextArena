Since they control the center, I should aim to control key corners to block potential winning combos and set up my own opportunities. Corner squares (2, 6, 8) are statistically better than edges because they intersect more winning lines.\n\nAfter analysis:\n- If I play at **8** (bottom-right):\n  - Blocks Player 0 from easily completing the diagonal (2-4-6) or bottom row (6-7-8).\n  - Creates potential for me to develop threats on the right column (2-5-8) or bottom row later.\n- Alternatives like 2 or 6 risk letting Player 0 dominate diagonals or corners.\n- Edges (1,3,5,7) are weaker now.\n\n**[8]** is optimal for board control. \n\n \n [8]\n\n\ud81a\udd23\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  [2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  Analyzing the board to block threats and create opportunities. Player 1 (X) has no immediate winning lines since the top row is now blocked, but the top left-to-bottom right diagonal (cells 0-4-8) is mixed and controlled. My priority is to:\n- **Block potential forks**: Player 1 could threaten the left vertical (0,3,6) or bottom horizontal (6,7,8) if left unchecked. \n- **Build winning lines**: My center (O at 4) and bottom-right (O at 8) dominance pairs well with corners.
