As Black, I should continue with development and prepare to castle as well. The most logical and principled move is to castle kingside too, bringing the king to safety and activating the rook.\n\nThe best move here is **O-O**, which in UCI notation is represented by the king moving from e8 to g8.\n\n**[e8g8]**\n\n[e8g8]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Illegal move: g8f6.
