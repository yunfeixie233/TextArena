      "response": "[d7d5] is not a valid move in this position for Black because the pawn on d7 is blocked by White's pawn on d4. The correct interpretation is that Black must choose a legal move from the valid moves list.\n\nGiven the current board and valid moves, I will choose a central pawn advance that challenges White's control. The move [e7e5] strikes at the center and opens lines for my pieces.\n\nMy move is: [e7e5]",
