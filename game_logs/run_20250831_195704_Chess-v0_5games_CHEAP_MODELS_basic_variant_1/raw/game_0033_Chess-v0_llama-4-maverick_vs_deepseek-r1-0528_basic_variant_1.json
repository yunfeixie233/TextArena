In response, White should consider developing pieces and supporting the central pawn. One of the most effective ways to do this is by developing the knight to a good square.\n\nThe valid moves provided include several options for development. Noting that [c1g5] and [b1c3] are among the valid moves, we can see that developing the knight to c3 is a strategic move as it supports the d4 pawn and prepares for further development.\n\nLet's examine the move [b1c3], which develops the knight to a good square, supporting the d4 pawn and getting ready to develop other pieces.\n\nMove: [b1c3]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Illegal move: d7d5. This move is not legal in the current position. Please try again.\n[GAME] Player 0 attempted an invalid move. Reason: Illegal move: d7d5. This move is not legal in the current position.

Black has played [d7d5] in response to White's [d2d4], challenging the central pawn. \n\nNow, it's White's turn again. As previously thought, developing the knight to a good square is a good strategy. The move [b1c3] is a valid and strategic choice as it develops the knight, supports the d4 pawn, and prepares for further development.\n\nLet's try again with the move: [b1c3]\n\nMove: [b1c3]",
