This is a common tactical error known as the \"Scholar's Mate\" attempt. It puts my king in check, but their queen does not support the bishop. The only legal moves are to capture the knight with the king or move the king to e7. Capturing the bishop is the obvious move, which I will do.\n\nMove: [e8f7]\n[GAME] Player 1 made the following move: e8f7\n[GAME] Current board:\n   +-----------------+\n 8 | r . b q . b . r |\n 7 | p p p p . k p p |\n 6 | . . n . . n . . |\n 5 | . . . . p . . . |\n 4 | . . . .
