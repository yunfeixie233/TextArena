Playing [g8f6] is a strong choice as it develops the kingside knight, directly attacks White's e4 pawn, and enhances my control over key central squares like d5 and e4, while also preparing for castling and further piece coordination.\n\n[g8f6]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Illegal move: g1f3.
