      "response": "I need to adjust my strategy based on the fact that Player 1 keeps rejecting my offers and keeps asking for Brick. Let me analyze what we've seen so far:\n\n**Key observations:**\n- Player 1 has rejected every offer involving Brick outflow\n- Player 1 keeps trying to GET Brick (offering Wheat+Wood for 5 Brick, Sheep+Ore for 7 Brick+1 Wheat, Wood for 6 Brick)\n- This strongly suggests Player 1 values Brick highly and likely has a surplus of other resources\n\n**Re-evaluation:**\nGiven Player 1's scarcity of Brick and abundance of other resources, I should focus on getting resources I need (mainly Ore, as it has the highest value at 2.18/unit) while avoiding Brick giveaways.\n\nLet me try to get value by asking for Ore/Some combination that doesn't involve giving up Brick:\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 4 Ore, 2 Wheat]",
