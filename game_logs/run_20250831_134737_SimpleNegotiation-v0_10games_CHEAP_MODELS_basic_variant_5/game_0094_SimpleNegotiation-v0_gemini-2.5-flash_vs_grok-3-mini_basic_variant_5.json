I might be able to trade some less valuable Ore for even more valuable Brick if I'm strategic.

This was a bad deal as Player 0 lost 5 value.\n\nTarget: Increase total value.\n\nMy strategy is to trade resources I have in abundance (relative to their value) for resources that are more valuable.\n\nI have low quantities of Wheat and Wood. My Wood value is lower than my Wheat.\nMy Ore quantity is high and very valuable.\n\nI will try to get rid of my Wheat and Wood for more Sheep and Brick.\n\nBased on past offers, Player 1 seems to value Sheep and Brick.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 5 * 6 (Wheat) + 5 * 8 (Wood) = 30 + 40 = 70\nValue requested: 1 * 32 (Ore) = 32\n\nThis is a terrible offer for me from a pure value perspective. I offered far too much for 1 Ore. I need to be more efficient.\n\nThe last successful trade was [Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick].\nOffered value: 4*6 + 3*8 = 24 + 24 = 48\nRequested value: 1*18 + 1*25 = 18 + 25 = 43\nThis was accepted but reduced my net worth. I need to make offers that increase my total value.\n\nWhat does Player 1 want? Player 1 last offered \"4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore\". This implies Player 1 wants Brick and Ore, and is willing to give Wheat and Wood.\n\nI want to increase my valuable resources (Brick, Ore, Sheep).\nI have a lot of Ore, but it is very valuable. I should not trade it away easily.\nI have relatively little Wheat and Wood. I can convert them.\n\nI will try to convert my Wheat and Wood into something more valuable. I have a medium amount of Sheep and Brick, but they are more valuable than Wheat and Wood.\n\nInstead of targeting just one resource, I will try to swap a large quantity of low-value resources for a smaller quantity of high-value resources.\n\nCurrent Resources:\nWheat: 5 (Value 6)\nWood: 11 (Value 8)\nSheep: 9 (Value 18)\nBrick: 11 (Value 25)\nOre: 23 (Value 32)\n\nLet's try to get more Sheep and Brick.\n\nConsider player 1's last offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore.\nValue of 4 Wheat, 3 Wood = 4*6 + 3*8 = 24 + 24 = 48\nValue of 1 Brick, 1 Ore = 25 + 32 = 57. Player 0 rejected this, but it would have increased my value by 9. I should have taken it! My mistake. I miscalculated the last one.\n\nOkay, I need to make offers that have a positive net change in value for me.\n\nMy current resource counts are:\nWheat: 5\nWood: 11\nSheep: 9\nBrick: 11\nOre: 23\n\nI need to replenish my Wheat and Wood if I want to keep bundling them for trades.\nIt's better to offer resources I have in surplus if possible. My Ore is in surplus.\n\nLet's look for a trade that gives me a higher value than what I give up.\nI have a lot of Ore. Could I trade some Ore (value 32) for a lot of Sheep (value 18) and Brick (value 25)?\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick]\nValue of 1 Ore: 32\nValue of 1 Sheep, 1 Brick: 18 + 25 = 43 (Net +11 for me)\nThis seems like a good offer for me. It might be less attractive to the other player given they seem to want Ore.\n\nLet's try a different approach. I have very little Wheat. I should get more of it if possible, but only if it's a good deal.\n\nIf Player 1 wants Brick and Ore, maybe I can give them a little in exchange for something I want more.\n\nLet's rethink based on Player 1's last offer to me: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore (I rejected it but shouldn't have).\nThis shows what Player 1 is willing to give (Wheat, Wood) and what they want (Brick, Ore).\n\nI need to trade my low-value resources for higher-value resources specifically Sheep, Brick, or Ore.\n\nI'm low on Wheat (5) and relatively low on Wood (11).\nI have a lot of Ore (23).\n\nI will now try to exploit Player 1's stated preference for Brick and Ore, while trying to get Sheep or just maximize my value.\n\nOffer: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nValue Offered: 2 * 18 = 36\nValue Requested: 1 * 25 = 25\nBad deal. No.\n\nWhat if I offer Ore to get something else?\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep]\nValue Offered: 32\nValue Requested: 2 * 18 = 36\nNet +4. This isn't great, but it's positive.\n\nLet's review the previous turn results:\nPlayer 0 offered: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick\nValue offered: 48. Value received: 43. (Net -5 for P0)Accepted by P1. Current P0 Inventory: 5W, 11Wo, 9S, 11B, 23O\n\nPlayer 1 made no new trade offer. That means it's my turn to make an offer.\n\nI need to get more value. I have too much Ore compared to other resources, but it's very valuable. I will not trade it away for less or similar value.\n\nLet's try to get rid of my Wheat and Wood for more valuable items.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Sheep]\nValue offered: 3*6 + 3*8 = 18 + 24 = 42\nValue requested: 1*18 = 18. This is a very bad trade for me.\n\nI need to be very aggressive in seeking value.\n\nMy highest valued item is Ore (32). My lowest is Wheat (6).\n\nLet's try to get a Brick (25) or Ore (32) for my Wheat and Wood.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]\nValue offered: 5*6 + 10*8 = 30 + 80 = 110\nValue requested: 1*25 + 1*18 = 25 + 18 = 43. This is awful for me.\n\nOkay, I need to make smaller, more carefully calculated offers.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 is rational and wants to increase their value too.\n\nI have 5 Wheat, 11 Wood. These are my main candidates for trading away for higher-value items.\nI have a fair amount of Sheep and Brick, and a lot of Ore.\n\nI should leverage the fact that Player 1 offered (4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore) in the past.\nThis means Player 1 wants Brick and Ore, and has Wheat and Wood to trade.\n\nI will offer Wheat and Wood for something I want, and keep the value slightly in my favor.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]\nValue offered: 5*6 + 5*8 = 30 + 40 = 70 (This uses all my Wheat and nearly half my Wood).\nValue requested: 1*25 + 1*18 = 43. Still a bad deal for me.\n\nI need to be careful with the value calculation and make sure I gain value.\n\nLet's try to get something simple for my Wheat or Wood.\nWhat if I try to get Brick for my Wood?\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick]\nValue offered: 3 * 8 = 24\nValue requested: 1 * 25 = 25\nThis is a net gain of +1 for me. This is a very small gain, but it's positive.\n\nI have 11 Wood. I can make this offer. It's a small gain, but it's something.\nIt also might be palatable for Player 1 if they need Wood.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Player 1's previous rejected offer (from me): 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore.\nValue In: 42 (1 Brick, 1 Ore)\nValue Out: 48 (4 Wheat, 3 Wood)\nNo, my calculation was incorrect earlier. This offer from P1 had a value of 57 (1 Brick 25, 1 Ore 32) asked for 48 (4 Wheat 24, 3 Wood 24). It was a good deal for me. I should have accepted.\n\nI missed a valuable trade. I need to be more careful.\n\nGiven Player 1 wanted Brick and Ore and offered Wheat and Wood for it, I should capitalize on that.\nMy current high value items are Sheep, Brick, Ore. My low value items are Wheat, Wood.\n\nI have 5 Wheat and 11 Wood.\nI have 9 Sheep, 11 Brick, 23 Ore.\n\nI have enough Ore (23) to potentially trade some of it for something I'm missing, like Wheat or Wood, if I get a lot of it for little Ore.\nHowever, my primary goal is to increase total value, so trading Ore needs a very good value return.\n\nI will try to make an offer that uses my abundant Ore to get good value items.\nBut Player 1 wants Brick and Ore. Trading Ore *to* Player 1 for less than its value is bad.\n\nInstead, I will try to trade low value resources for high value resources.\nThe best trade I could have made was accepting Player 1's last rejected offer.\n\nI will make an offer that is similar in structure to Player 1's previous offer, but with the value slightly favoring me.\nPlayer 1 was willing to give 4 Wheat, 3 Wood for 1 Brick, 1 Ore.\nI want to give Wheat and Wood to get Brick or Ore or Sheep.\n\nLet's offer a lot of Wheat and Wood for some valuable items.\nI used 4 Wheat and 3 Wood previously for 1 Sheep and 1 Brick, which was a bad deal for me.\n\nI have 5 Wheat and 11 Wood.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick]\nValue offered: 5*6 + 5*8 = 30 + 40 = 70\nValue requested: 1*18 + 1*25 = 43\nThis is a bad trade for me.\n\nI need to make winning trades.\nI should aim for a higher value of received items compared to offered items.\n\nWhat if I offer Ore for something?\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood]\nValue offered: 32\nValue requested: 25 + 8 = 33\nThis gets me +1 value and replaces some of my high-value Ore with Wood which I'm somewhat low on. It also gets me a Brick. This is a decent value-positive trade.\n\nLet's try this.\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood]",
