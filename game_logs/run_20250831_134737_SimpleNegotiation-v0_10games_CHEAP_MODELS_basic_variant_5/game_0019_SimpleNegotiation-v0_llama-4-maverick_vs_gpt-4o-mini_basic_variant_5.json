However, in terms of overall resource evaluation, you lose value in the process.\n\nGiven that you have 16 Ore already, and it's a high-value resource, it may be wiser to hold on to your Wheat, as Wheat is lower in overall trade value. \n\nThus, the best action at this moment would be to **reject the current offer**. \n\nI'm making a trade offer for my next turn.\n\n**Trade offer:**\n- I will offer [Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore].\n\nThis trade is appealing to many players, especially if they see a benefit from acquiring Wood and Brick at possibly lower values in relation to the higher value of Ore.\n\nHere\u2019s my action: \n- **[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]**",
