      "response": "The game is about resource trading. I need to increase the total value of my resources.\n\nHere's a summary of my current resources and their values:\n*   **Wheat:** 14 units @ 5 value/unit = 70\n*   **Wood:** 8 units @ 10 value/unit = 80\n*   **Sheep:** 14 units @ 13 value/unit = 182\n*   **Brick:** 17 units @ 20 value/unit = 340\n*   **Ore:** 25 units @ 35 value/unit = 875\n\nMy total current value is 70 + 80 + 182 + 340 + 875 = 1547.\n\nI want to make offers that increase my total value. To do this, I should aim to trade resources that are less valuable to me for resources that are more valuable to me. Or, trade away abundant resources for resources I have less of, especially if the requested resource has a higher unit value.\n\nLet's prioritize:\n*   Ore is my most valuable resource per unit (35). I want more of this if possible, or only trade it away for a *very* good deal.\n*   Brick is next (20).\n*   Sheep (13).\n*   Wood (10).\n*   Wheat (5). Wheat is my least valuable per unit. I have a fair amount (14).\n\nI have a lot of Brick and Ore. This gives me flexibility to offer them, but I should be careful not to give up too much value.\n\n**Turn 1 Strategy:**\nI want to get rid of Wheat, Wood, or Sheep for higher value items like Brick or Ore, or even exchange for other resources if the trade ratio is favorable.\n\nLet's try to get some high-value resources. I have a lot of Wheat and Sheep. Let's try to trade some Wheat for something better.\n\nInitial thought: Offer less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\nFor example, I could offer Wheat + Wood for Ore or Brick.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore.\n\n**Offer Idea 1:** Trade some Wheat and Wood for Ore.\n(1 Wheat = 5, 1 Wood = 10) -> (Total 15 for 1 unit of Ore = 35) is bad for me. I need to offer more units or a combination of units to get 1 unit of a higher-value resource.\n\nLet's look at relative values.\n1 Ore (35) is roughly equivalent to:\n*   7 Wheat (7 * 5 = 35)\n*   3.5 Wood (3.5 * 10 = 35)\n*   2.7 Sheep (2.7 * 13 = 35)\n*   1.75 Brick (1.75 * 20 = 35)\n\nI should offer slightly more than the equivalent value of my less valuable resources to get a higher value resource, as the other player might also value their high-value resources highly. Or, I can try to get them to give me a higher value resource for a *fair* amount of my lower-value resources, aiming for a small profit.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick, as it's a good intermediate value. I have plenty of Wheat and Sheep.\n\nI'll make an offer that feels beneficial yet reasonable.\nWhat if I offer a good amount of my lowest value (Wheat) for a unit of Brick?\n1 Brick = 20. 4 Wheat = 20. This is a fair trade by value. I gain nothing.\nI need to offer slightly less value to gain more value. This means I want to give up resources that sum to a lower value than the resources I receive.\n\nLet's try: Offer 3 Wheat (value 15) and 1 Wood (value 10) = Total 25. Request 2 Brick (value 40). This is a good deal for me. Total gain of 15. The player might deny.\n\nLet's try a softer approach for the first turn.\nI have a lot of Sheep and Brick already.\n\nI could try to consolidate. I have plenty of Sheep, Wheat, and Brick.\nMaybe I can offer Wheat and Sheep for Ore.\n\nLet's try to offer a quantity of low-value resources for a single, high-value resource.\nExample: 3 Wheat (15) + 1 Sheep (13) = 28. Request 1 Ore (35). This is beneficial. (Gain 7 value).\n\nAlternatively, I could try to offer an excess resource for another excess, but aiming for a positive value exchange.\nI have 14 Sheep and 17 Brick.\n\nLet's make a clear value-increasing offer that isn't too aggressive.\n\nI have 14 Wheat. Wheat is my lowest value. I would love to trade some of it away.\nI have 8 Wood.\n\nConsider: Offer 4 Wheat (5*4=20) and 2 Wood (10*2=20) = 40. Request 2 Brick (20*2=40) and 1 Sheep (13).\nThis swap has me offer 40 value and request 53 value. That's a gain of 13 value. It might be accepted if the other player needs Wheat and Wood.\n\nLet's simplify. Offer a modest trade to see their preferences.\nI have plenty of Wheat (14) and Sheep (14).\nLet's try to get some Ore.\n\nOffer: 4 Sheep (value 4*13 = 52). Request: 2 Ore (value 2*35 = 70).\nThis is a gain of 18 value for me. It's pushing it, but still reasonable as I give up 4 sheep for something with high value. If they have excess ore, they might take it.\n\nLet's refine. What if they value Sheep more?\nWhat if I trade some Sheep and Brick, which I have in good quantity, for Ore?\n\nI will start by trying to trade my lowest value item, Wheat.\nLet's offer a reasonable amount of Wheat for a resource I want more of, given its higher value.\n\n**Turn 1 Offer:**\nI have 14 Wheat (value 5). I want to get higher value resources like Brick (20) or Ore (35).\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Brick]\nMy offer: 6 Wheat * 5 = 30 value.\nMy request: 2 Brick * 20 = 40 value.\nThis is a net gain of 10 value for me. I'm trading my lowest value resource for a higher-value resource, increasing my total value. This seems like a fair starting offer that benefits me without being overly greedy. I have plenty of Wheat to spare.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",
