Given the values, Ore and Sheep are highly valued, but I have a significant quantity of both. Wood is also abundant.\n\nLet's consider what a good trade might look like:\n1. **Trading away lower-value resources for higher-value ones** could be beneficial.\n2. Given the high value of Ore and Sheep, trading away some Wheat (the lowest value resource) or other less valuable resources for more of a higher-value resource could be a good strategy.\n\n### Potential First Offer:\nSince Wheat is the least valuable resource per unit and I have a moderate quantity of it, I might consider trading some Wheat for a resource that is more valuable or equally valuable but potentially less abundant for me.\n\nLet's examine a possible trade:\n- I have 8 Wheat, which is a relatively small quantity. If I can trade it for something of higher total value, it could be beneficial.\n\n### First Action:\nTo start negotiating, I'll offer 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep, as Sheep is more valuable than Wheat. The offer is:\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nThis corresponds to:\n- Giving away: 4 Wheat * 5 = 20 value\n- Gaining: 1 Sheep * 17 = 17 value\n\nThis isn't a great trade in terms of immediate value, but it's a starting point. Let's see how the opponent responds.\n\n### Turn 1 Action:\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.",
