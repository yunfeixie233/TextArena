Given the current values:\n- The most valuable resource I have is Ore (Value: 36).\n- The least valuable resource I have is Wheat (Value: 5).\n\nA potential strategy is to offer resources that are less valuable or abundant in exchange for more valuable resources or those that are underrepresented in my inventory.\n\n### Initial Offer\n\nSince Wheat is the least valuable and I have a relatively high quantity of Brick and Ore, which are more valuable, I will consider trading Wheat for a more valuable resource. Let's assume Wood or Sheep could be potential resources to receive in trade, as they are somewhat valuable but their values are less than Brick and Ore.\n\nLet's make an initial offer: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 2 Wood]`.\n\nThis offer is made to initiate a trade. I'm offering 4 units of Wheat (total value = 20) for 2 units of Wood (total value = 24), which would result in a net gain of 4 in value.\n\n### Turn 1 Action\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 2 Wood]`\n\nI will wait for the opponent's response to this offer.",

We already have a significant amount of both. Let's examine if trading some of our less valuable resources for more of the highly valued ones or maintaining a good balance could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a counteroffer.\nOne potential trade could involve offering some Wheat (low value) or Wood (moderate value) for Ore or Brick (high value). However, we need to be cautious about devaluing our current resource mix.\n\n## Step 5: Propose a trade.\nLet's offer something for Ore since it's the most valuable. We could propose: [Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\n\n## Calculation for the proposed trade:\n- Current: Wood = 21, Sheep = 11, Ore = 21\n- After trade: Wood = 21 - 5 = 16, Sheep = 11 - 2 = 9, Ore = 21 + 3 = 24\n\nValue before trade = (6 * 5) + (21 * 12) + (11 * 17) + (25 * 25) + (21 * 36) = 1850\nValue after trade = (6 * 5) + (16 * 12) + (9 * 17) + (25 * 25) + (24 * 36)\n                  = 30 + 192 + 153 + 625 + 864\n                  = 1864\n\nThis trade increases the total value from 1850 to 1864.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Ore]}$",
