      "response": "Given the trades that have occurred so far, it appears that both players are struggling to find common ground in terms of resource value. Player 1 has rejected all trade offers from Player 0 and vice versa.\n\nGiven your current resources:\n- Wheat (5)\n- Wood (17)\n- Sheep (12)\n- Brick (13)\n- Ore (19)\n\nYour goal is to maximize the value of your resources. Accepting the current offer from Player 0 would involve giving up 5 Wheat and 5 Brick in exchange for 2 Ore.\n\nLet's evaluate the current situation for Player 1:\n\n1. **Current Offer Evaluation**:\n   - **From Player 0**: Offering 5 Brick, 5 Wheat -> Requested 2 Ore\n   - Value of 5 Wheat = 5 * 6 = 30\n   - Value of 5 Brick = 5 * 28 = 140\n   - Total Value given away = 30 + 140 = 170\n   - Value of 2 Ore = 2 * 37 = 74\n   - Resulting change in value = 74 - 170 = -96 (Definitely not a good trade!)\n\nConsidering this, it's clear that accepting Player 0's offer is not advantageous. Let\u2019s take a more aggressive stance and propose a more appealing offer that aims to offload excess resources while gaining something of value.\n\nI will make a new offer to Player 0:\n\n**New Offer**: \n- Offered items: 3 Brick, 4 Sheep -> Requested items: 2 Ore \n\nLet's submit this offer:\n[Offer: 3 Brick, 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "I notice my previous offers haven\u2019t been accepted, and my opponent keeps trying to get 2 Ore for low-value packages. I have 11 Ore, the highest-valued resource, and short Ore supply likely benefits me. At current values, 1 Ore = 37 points, whereas 1 Brick = 26, 1 Sheep = 18, 1 Wheat = 5. Player 1\u2019s last offer gives only ~160 worth of goods for 2 Ore (74). That\u2019s too low.\n\nSince Ore is scarce and valuable, I should avoid parting with it at these exchange rates. Instead, I can acquire cheap under-valued resources from Player 1. Wheat is valued at only 5, and I have 24; Brick at 26, but I already have 17. I can sell Brick (arguably plentiful) for more value elsewhere.\n\nLet me propose a deal that gives Player 1 something they seem to want (Brick) without parting with highly-valued Ore.\n\n[Offer: 4 Brick -> 10 Wheat]",
