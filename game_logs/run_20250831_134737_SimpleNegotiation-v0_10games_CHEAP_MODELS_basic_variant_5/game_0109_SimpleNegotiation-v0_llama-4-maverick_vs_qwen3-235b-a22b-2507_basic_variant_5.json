We can offer some Wheat (the lowest value resource) and see if we can get a more valuable resource in return. \n\nConsidering the values, let's offer 8 Wheat for 2 Wood (though Wood is more valuable than Wheat, it's still relatively less valuable compared to others, and this trade slightly increases our total value).\n\nHowever, a potentially more strategic move would be to directly aim for the most valuable resources or maintain a balance.\n\nLet's make a more strategic offer:\n'[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis translates to: '[Offer: 8 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 1 Ore]'\n\nThe formatted offer is: '[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n\n### Response\n'[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'",
