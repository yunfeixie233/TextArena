One strategy could be to counter-offer with something that is more in our favor.\n\nBefore making a counter-offer, let's assess what we have and what we could potentially offer or request:\n\n- We have: \n  - Wheat: 22\n  - Wood: 23\n  - Sheep: 15\n  - Brick: 21\n  - Ore: 11\n\nA potential counter-offer could involve offering something we have in abundance relative to its value and requesting something of higher value. However, given the current offer, a more straightforward approach might be to directly respond or make a counter-offer that is more favorable.\n\nSince the current offer is not very favorable, we could consider denying it and making a new offer. One possible trade could involve offering resources that we have in relative abundance and are of lower value, in exchange for resources that are of higher value.\n\nFor example, we could think of making an offer that involves giving away some Wheat (lower value) and getting something more valuable in return, or giving away Wood and getting Ore or Brick, as they are more valuable.\n\nLet's draft a potential counter-offer. One idea is: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 3 Brick]`.\n\nLet's evaluate this counter-offer:\n- We give: \n  - 5 Wheat = 5 * 6 = 30\n  - 2 Wood = 2 * 11 = 22\n  Total given = 30 + 22 = 52\n\n- We receive:\n  - 1 Ore = 1 * 36 = 36\n  - 3 Brick = 3 * 25 = 75\n  Total received = 36 + 75 = 111\n\nThe gain is 111 - 52 = 59, which is a positive gain.\n\nThus, we will deny the current offer and make this new counter-offer.\n\n`[Deny]` \n`[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 3 Brick]`",

      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the current state of resources\nThe current resources and their values for Player 1 are: Wheat (Qty: 22, Value: 6), Wood (Qty: 23, Value: 11), Sheep (Qty: 15, Value: 18), Brick (Qty: 21, Value: 25), Ore (Qty: 11, Value: 36).\n\n## Step 2: Review the transactions that have taken place\nPlayer 1 initially had: Wheat (22), Wood (23), Sheep (15), Brick (21), Ore (11).\nAfter the first rejected offer by Player 0, the quantities remained the same.\nAfter the second rejected offer by Player 1, the quantities remained the same.\nThen, Player 1 made an offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 3 Brick. After this trade, Player 1's resources changed to: Wheat (22 - 5 = 17), Wood (23 - 2 = 21), Sheep (15), Brick (21 + 3 = 24), Ore (11 + 1 = 12).\nAfter the second trade: Player 1 made an offer: 5 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 2 Sheep, 1 Ore. After this trade, Player 1's resources changed to: Wheat (17 - 1 = 16), Wood (21 - 5 = 16), Sheep (15 + 2 = 17), Brick (24), Ore (12 + 1 = 13).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the current total value of resources for Player 1\nThe current quantities are: Wheat (16), Wood (16), Sheep (17), Brick (24), Ore (13).\nThe total value = (16 * 6) + (16 * 11) + (17 * 18) + (24 * 25) + (13 * 36)\n= 96 + 176 + 306 + 600 + 468\n= 1646.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the next course of action based on the current resources and potential trades\nTo increase the total value, we should look for trades that give us higher value resources or reduce the quantity of lower value resources. The current resources and their total values are: Wheat (96), Wood (176), Sheep (306), Brick (600), Ore (468).\n\n## Step 5: Consider potential trades\nWe should consider offering resources with lower values and requesting resources with higher values. For example, offering Wheat (Value: 6) or Wood (Value: 11) for Sheep (Value: 18), Brick (Value: 25), or Ore (Value: 36) could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 6: Formulate a trade offer\nLet's formulate a trade offer. We can offer some Wheat and/or Wood for Ore or Brick since they have higher values. For instance, we could offer: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick].\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the value of the proposed trade offer\nFor the offer: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick].\n- We give away: (4 * 6) + (2 * 11) = 24 + 22 = 46.\n- We receive: (1 * 36) + (1 * 25) = 36 + 25 = 61.\nThe net gain = 61 - 46 = 15.\n\n## Step 8: Check if the trade is feasible with the current quantities\nWe have: Wheat (16), Wood (16), Sheep (17), Brick (24), Ore (13).\nFor [Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick], we need: Wheat (4), Wood (2), and we can give them away since 16 >= 4 and 16 >= 2. We also need to receive Ore (1) and Brick (1), which our opponent needs to have.\n\n## Step 9: Decide on the trade offer\nThe proposed trade [Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick] seems beneficial as it results in a net gain of 15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]}$",

The values per resource are: Wheat = 6, Wood = 11, Sheep = 18, Brick = 25, Ore = 36.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the last offer made and the response.\nThe last offer made by Player 1 was (4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick), which was rejected. Let's evaluate its potential:\n- Giving away: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood = (4*6) + (2*11) = 24 + 22 = 46\n- Receiving: 1 Ore, 1 Brick = 36 + 25 = 61\nSince 61 > 46, this trade is beneficial.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on the next action based on the analysis.\nGiven that the last trade offer was beneficial but got rejected, it might be worth considering a similar or slightly adjusted offer. However, we need to look at our current resources and think about what else we can offer or request.\n\n## Step 6: Formulate a new trade offer.\nLet's examine our resources again: Wheat = 16, Wood = 16, Sheep = 17, Brick = 24, Ore = 13.\nA potential trade could involve offering resources that are relatively less valuable to us and gaining resources that are more valuable.\n\n## Step 7: Propose a new trade.\nConsidering our resources and the previous beneficial trade, we can think about offering Wheat or Wood (lower value) and requesting Ore or Brick (higher value). One possible trade is: [Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick].\n- Giving away: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood = (3*6) + (2*11) = 18 + 22 = 40\n- Receiving: 1 Ore, 1 Brick = 36 + 25 = 61\nThis trade is beneficial as 61 > 40.\n\n## Step 8: Check if the proposed trade is feasible with our current resources.\nWe have: Wheat = 16, Wood = 16.\n- Offering 3 Wheat: 16 - 3 = 13 (feasible)\n- Offering 2 Wood: 16 - 2 = 14 (feasible)\nSo, the proposed trade is feasible.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]}$",
