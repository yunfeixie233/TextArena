      "response": "### Negotiation Game Initial Analysis\n\nAs Player 0, my goal is to increase the total value of my resources through trades with my opponent.\n\n#### Initial Resources and Values:\n\n- **[Wheat]**   Quantity: 21   Value: 5\n- **[Wood]**    Quantity: 23   Value: 10\n- **[Sheep]**   Quantity: 20   Value: 17\n- **[Brick]**   Quantity: 8    Value: 29\n- **[Ore]**     Quantity: 9    Value: 37\n\n#### Initial Total Value Calculation:\n\n1. Wheat: 21 * 5 = 105\n2. Wood: 23 * 10 = 230\n3. Sheep: 20 * 17 = 340\n4. Brick: 8 * 29 = 232\n5. Ore: 9 * 37 = 333\n\nTotal Value = 105 + 230 + 340 + 232 + 333 = 1240\n\n#### Strategy:\n\nTo maximize the total value, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but in a quantity that benefits me.\n\n#### First Turn Analysis:\n\nLet's start by examining potential trades that could increase my total value. I have a relatively high quantity of Wheat and Wood, which are lower in value compared to Sheep, Brick, and Ore.\n\n1. **Potential Trade 1:** Offer Wheat or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n   - Example: '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]' (Since Wheat is worth 5 and Brick is worth 29, this trade is beneficial if the quantity is favorable).\n   - Calculation: 5 Wheat = 25 value, 1 Brick = 29 value. Beneficial.\n\n2. **Potential Trade 2:** Offer Sheep for Ore.\n   - Example: '[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' \n   - Calculation: 2 Sheep = 34 value, 1 Ore = 37 value. Beneficial.\n\nLet's make an initial offer based on the first beneficial trade identified:\n\n### Action for Turn 1:\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis action proposes trading 5 units of Wheat for 1 unit of Brick, increasing my total value by 4 (29 for Brick - 25 for 5 Wheat).\n\nLet's see the response from the opponent and proceed accordingly.",

Accepted by Player 1.\n   - Update after Turn 5:\n     - Given: 2 Wheat\n     - Received: 1 Wood\n     - New Quantities:\n       - Wheat: 13 - 2 = 11\n       - Wood: 23 + 1 = 24\n     - New Total Value:\n       - Wheat: 11 * 5 = 55\n       - Wood: 24 * 10 = 240\n       - Sheep: 20 * 17 = 340\n       - Brick: 9 * 29 = 261\n       - Ore: 9 * 37 = 333\n       - Total = 55 + 240 + 340 + 261 + 333 = 1229\n\n6. **Current Status:**\n   - The total value remains the same at 1229 after the last trade.\n\n7. **Next Step:**\n   - We need to analyze the current resources and think about the next trade.\n   - Current Resources:\n     - Wheat: 11\n     - Wood: 24\n     - Sheep: 20\n     - Brick: 9\n     - Ore: 9\n\n8. **Potential Trades:**\n   - Consider offering resources with lower value for resources with higher value.\n   - One potential trade could be offering Wheat or Wood for Ore or Brick.\n\n### Decision for the Next Turn:\nLet's examine potential trades:\n- **Wheat (Value: 5)** is the lowest value resource we have. We have 11 Wheat.\n- **Wood (Value: 10)** is the next lowest. We have 24 Wood.\n- We could consider trading Wheat or Wood for higher value resources like Brick (Value: 29) or Ore (Value: 37).\n\nGiven that we were able to get Brick for Wheat previously, and our last trade didn't change the total value, we should look for a similar or better opportunity.\n\nLet's offer 4 Wood for 1 Ore, as Ore has a significantly higher value than Wood.\n- **[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]**\n\nThis will be our next move.\n\n### Response:\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 0 Ore -> 1 Ore, 0 Wood] is not the correct format; instead, we should directly use the special token for the action as follows:\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
