      "response": "Let me first summarize my priorities, then open negotiations.\n\nCurrent inventory & per-unit values:\n- Wheat 22@6\n- Wood 6@8\n- Sheep 7@16\n- Brick 18@27\n- Ore 14@38\n\nTotal current value\n= 22\u00b76 + 6\u00b78 + 7\u00b716 + 18\u00b727 + 14\u00b738\n= 132 + 48 + 112 + 486 + 532 = 1 310 points.\n\nObservations\n1. Wheat is my lowest-value good, so I\u2019m happy to give it away for anything worth >6.\n2. Ore is my highest-value good, so I should trade it only for disproportionately good (large) trades.\n3. I am oversupplied on Brick (18).  Trading some Brick for higher-value resources (Ore > Brick) would raise my score.\n4. Wood and Sheep are between these extremes; I can use them flexibly.\n\nOpening position: I\u2019d like to turn low-value Wheat and excess Brick into higher-value resources (especially Ore and Sheep, or at least Wood).  My starting ask will be generous in Wheat/Brick while seeking modest improvements.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nPlayer 0: \u201cHello, Player 1!\n\nI\u2019m sitting on a big pile of Wheat (22) and Brick (18) and would love to turn some of them into Wood, Sheep, or hopefully a little Ore.  I can offer favorable rates.\n\nFor instance, how about:\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 4 Brick \u2192 2 Wood, 3 Sheep]  \n\nThis gives you 9 resources while only asking for 5 in return (the extras are just there to make the trade favor you slightly, since Wheat/Brick are abundant for me).\n\nLet me know what you think or suggest another combination\u2014we\u2019ve got ten turns to improve both our positions!\u201d",
