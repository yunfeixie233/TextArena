It was 5 Wheat, 3 Sheep for 2 Ore, 1 Wood.\n  Total value of my offer: (5 * 5) + (3 * 14) = 25 + 42 = 67\n  Total value of Player 1's requested items: (2 * 40) + (1 * 11) = 80 + 11 = 91\n  This means my previous offer was not balanced in my favor. I offered 67 value for 91 value. This is a negative trade for me. I need to make sure I get more value than I give.\n\n  My goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I have a lot of Brick and Ore, which are high-value items, but also quite a bit of Wheat and Sheep. I want to convert lower-value items into higher-value ones.\n\n  I have 18 Wheat (value 5) and 17 Sheep (value 14).\n  I have 22 Brick (value 27) and 23 Ore (value 40). These are high value.\n\n  Let's consider trading some of my lower value resources for higher value ones.\n  I want to get more Ore or Brick.\n\n  Let's try to trade Wheat and Sheep for Brick or Ore.\n  How about 10 Wheat (50 value) for 2 Brick (54 value)? This is a slightly positive trade for me.\n  Or 10 Wheat, 2 Sheep (50 + 28 = 78 value) for 2 Ore (80 value)? This is also slightly positive.\n\n  Given Player 1 rejected the previous offer, perhaps they don't want Wheat or Sheep, or they want more value.\n\n  Let's try to offer a more balanced trade, but still favorable to me.\n  My current total value: (18*5) + (9*11) + (17*14) + (22*27) + (23*40) = 90 + 99 + 238 + 594 + 920 = 1941\n\n  I will try to get more high value resources.\n  I will offer:\n  - 10 Wheat (Value: 50)\n  - 5 Sheep (Value: 70)\n  Total offered value = 120\n\n  I will request:\n  - 3 Brick (Value: 81)\n  - 1 Ore (Value: 40)\n  Total requested value = 121\n\n  This is a small gain for me, offering 120 value for 121. This is a small gain but still a positive step.\n  It also removes some of my lower value resources.\n  Even if Player 1 has a different valuation, this should be fairer.\n  [Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Ore]",
