We need to maximize our value further.\n   - Sheep is now lower (10), but we have high Ore (26). Brick is also high (20), which is valuable (20 per unit). Wood and Wheat are less valuable per unit.\n\n4. **Potential Trades**:\n   - We could try to trade Wood or Wheat for more Brick or Ore, as these have higher per-unit value.\n   - Example: Offer Wood or Wheat for Brick or Ore in a favorable ratio.\n\n5. **Trade Proposal**:\n   - Offer 8 Wood (value 80) for 4 Brick (value 80). This is a 1:1 value trade, but Brick is more useful for us (higher per-unit value).\n   - Alternatively, offer Wheat for Ore or Brick, as Wheat is low value (6 per unit).\n\n6. **Final Decision**:\n   - Offer 5 Wheat (value 30) and 5 Wood (value 50) for 4 Brick (value 80) and 1 Ore (value 32). This gives us a net gain of 32 (80 + 32 - 30 - 50 = 32 in value).\n\nFinal answer: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 4 Brick, 1 Ore]",
