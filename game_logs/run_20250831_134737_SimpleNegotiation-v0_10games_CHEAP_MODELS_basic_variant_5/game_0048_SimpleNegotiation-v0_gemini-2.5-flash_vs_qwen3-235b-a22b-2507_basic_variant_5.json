Player 1 might have rejected it because they didn't have enough Ore, or they value Ore more than I thought, or the offer was too favorable to me.\n\nI have a lot of Brick (25) and Ore (22), which are high-value items. I have a good quantity of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep as well.\nLet's try to get more high-value resources like Ore or Brick, or shed low-value resources in exchange for higher-value ones.\n\nConsider trading away low-value resources like Wheat and Wood for something of higher value.\nWhat if I offer a larger quantity of lower-value items for a smaller quantity of higher-value items?\n\nLet's try another offer to gain Ore. Ore is my most valuable resource.\nOffer: 8 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 2 Ore\nOffered value: 8 * 5 (Wheat) + 5 * 12 (Wood) = 40 + 60 = 100\nRequested value: 2 * 36 (Ore) = 72\nThis offer is not good for me as it gives away too much value.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, but with a more balanced offer.\nWhat if Player 1 is low on low-value resources?\n\nLet's try to trade Brick for Ore, or Sheep for Ore. My Brick quantity is very high.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (3 * 25 = 75) for 2 Ore (2 * 36 = 72), it's slightly unfavorable for me but could be appealing to Player 1 if they need Brick.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, as it's the highest value resource.\nI have a lot of Sheep and Wood.\nOffer: 3 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore\nOffered value: 3 * 14 (Sheep) + 3 * 12 (Wood) = 42 + 36 = 78\nRequested value: 2 * 36 (Ore) = 72\nThis is still a bit unfavorable for me. I need to make offers that increase my total value.\n\nThe previous offer was 61 (offered) for 72 (requested). It was good for me. Player 1 rejected.\nMaybe Player 1 needs Wood and Wheat.\n\nLet's try to give away Wheat, Wood, and Sheep for Ore.\nMy last offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore (Value 61 -> 72) - Rejected by P1.\n\nLet's try to be a bit more generous from my side, but still profitable.\nI have a lot of Brick. What if I offer Brick for Ore, or Brick for Sheep/Wood/Wheat (if I think P1 needs it) and then use that to get Ore? No, that's too complex.\n\nI have a decent amount of Brick. What if I offer Brick for Ore?\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nOffered value: 2 * 25 (Brick) = 50\nRequested value: 1 * 36 (Ore) = 36\nThis is a bad offer for me.\n\nI need to increase my total value. So: value_offered < value_requested.\n\nLet's try: [Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Ore]\nOffered Value: 6 * 5 + 4 * 12 = 30 + 48 = 78\nRequested Value: 2 * 36 = 72\nStill not good for me.\n\nLet's try to get Brick or Ore. Both are high value.\nI have plenty of Wood and Sheep.\n[Offer: 6 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]\nOffered value: 6 * 14 (Sheep) + 3 * 12 (Wood) = 84 + 36 = 120\nRequested value: 2 * 25 (Brick) = 50\nThis is a terrible offer for me.\n\nI need to think from Player 1's perspective a bit. Why did they reject the last offer?\nMaybe they didn't have 2 Ore. Or maybe they valued their Ore more than my offer.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again, but offer more slightly higher value resources.\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]\nOffered value: 4 * 14 (Sheep) + 2 * 12 (Wood) = 56 + 24 = 80\nRequested value: 2 * 36 (Ore) = 72\nStill bad for me.\n\nThe last offer I made was 61 value for 72 value. This was good for me.\nI should try to offer something similar, maybe adjust quantities slightly.\nPerhaps 5 Wheat, 3 Wood was too much for Player 1 to part with the Ore.\n\nWhat if they need Brick? I have 25 Brick.\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nOffered Value: 4 * 5 + 2 * 12 + 2 * 14 = 20 + 24 + 28 = 72\nRequested Value: 1 * 25 = 25\nThis is horrible for me.\n\nI should make an offer where the value of what I'm getting is greater than the value of what I'm giving.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Ore]\nOffered Value: 10 * 5 (Wheat) + 5 * 12 (Wood) = 50 + 60 = 110\nRequested Value: 3 * 36 (Ore) = 108\nThis is slightly unfavorable to me. (110 offered for 108 received)\n\nLet's revisit the previous one that was rejected. (5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore) Value (61 -> 72).\nIt was a good offer for me. Player 1 rejected it.\nMaybe offer more quantity of low value items for 1 Ore.\n[Offer: 7 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nOffered Value: 7*5 + 3*12 = 35 + 36 = 71\nRequested Value: 1*36 = 36\nThis is a terrible offer for me.\n\nLet's try to get Brick. I have plenty of Ore and Brick.\nMy Brick is 25 value, Ore is 36 value.\nTrading away Ore for Brick makes sense if I get more Brick quantity.\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick]\nOffered Value: 2 * 36 = 72\nRequested Value: 3 * 25 = 75\nThis is a good offer for me (gain 3 value). And it changes 2 Ore into 3 Brick. This could be useful if Player 1 needs Ore and has spare Brick.\nI have 22 Ore, so giving up 2 is fine. I have 25 Brick, gaining 3 is also good.\n\nLet's try this. This increases my total value.\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick]",
