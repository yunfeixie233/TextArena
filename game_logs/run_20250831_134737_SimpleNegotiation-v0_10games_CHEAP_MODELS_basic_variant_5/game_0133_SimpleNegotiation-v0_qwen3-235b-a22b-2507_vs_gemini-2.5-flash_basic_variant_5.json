This offers a good profit margin for the opponent or leaves room for negotiation while still potentially being profitable for me if I get Ore.\nHowever, I want to ensure my trade is always profitable if accepted.\n\nLet's reconsider. I should offer something where the value I give is slightly less than the value I request, or equal, to break even or make a profit.\n\nLet's try to get Brick or Ore.\n\nOption 1: Trade Sheep for Brick.\nValue of 1 Brick = 30.\nValue of 1 Sheep = 18.\nSo, 2 Sheep = 36. This is too much to offer for 1 Brick.\nWhat about 1 Sheep and some Wheat or Wood?\n1 Sheep (18) + 1 Wood (12) = 30. This is an even trade for 1 Brick.
