      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the current state of resources and the task.\nWe need to increase the total value of our resources by trading. The current resources and their values are: Wheat (Qty: 11, Value: 5), Wood (Qty: 5, Value: 8), Sheep (Qty: 21, Value: 15), Brick (Qty: 14, Value: 27), Ore (Qty: 18, Value: 33).\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the last offers made and received.\nPlayer 0 made an offer: 3 Wood, 4 Brick -> 5 Ore. We rejected it. Then, we made an offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick, which was also rejected by Player 0.\n\n## Step 3: Assess the current resources and their total value.\nCalculate the total value: (11*5) + (5*8) + (21*15) + (14*27) + (18*33) = 55 + 40 + 315 + 378 + 594 = 1382.\n\n## Step 4: Consider potential trades based on resource values.\nTo increase the total value, we should consider offering resources with lower values and requesting those with higher values. The values are: Wheat (5), Wood (8), Sheep (15), Brick (27), Ore (33). So, ideally, we want to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a new trade offer based on the resource values.\nSince Ore and Brick are among the highest value resources, and we have Ore but could potentially benefit from more Brick, let's consider what we can offer. We have a significant quantity of Sheep, which is valued at 15. Offering some Sheep for Brick could be beneficial because Brick is valued higher (27) than Sheep.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the quantities for the new trade offer.\nLet's consider offering 3 Sheep (Value: 3*15 = 45) for 2 Brick (Value: 2*27 = 54), which would be a gain. So, a potential offer is: [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick].\n\n## Step 7: Express the trade offer in the required format.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]}$",

However, it was rejected twice. Let's try a different approach.\n\n### Alternative Offer:\nLet's directly calculate the value of resources and think about a potentially more appealing trade.\n\n1. Consider offering something we have in abundance and is less valuable for something scarce and more valuable.\n2. We could offer: 4 Ore (Value: 132) for something significantly valuable. However, giving away 4 Ore might be too much unless the request is very valuable.\n\nLet's form a new offer:\n- Offer: 6 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick\n- Offered: 6*5 + 2*8 = 30 + 16 = 46 value.\n- Requested: 3*27 = 81 value.\n- Net gain if accepted: 81 - 46 = 35 value.\n\nGiven the format required for the response, let's make this new offer:\n`[Offer: 6 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]`. \n\n### Response:\n`[Offer: 6 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]`",
