Focus on acquiring **Ore** (highest value).  \n2. Use **Wheat** and **Wood** (abundant, low-value) as primary trade offers.  \n3. Part with **Brick** only if the deal gives a clear net value increase (e.g., exchanging 2 Brick for 1 Ore).  \n4. Avoid trade imbalances (e.g., giving up 2+ Brick for 1 Ore deviates from the value scale and risks net loss).  \n\n---\n\n**Trade 1**  \nI want to test the waters by converting excess low-value resources into **Ore**.  \n\n[Offer: 12 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Sheep]",
