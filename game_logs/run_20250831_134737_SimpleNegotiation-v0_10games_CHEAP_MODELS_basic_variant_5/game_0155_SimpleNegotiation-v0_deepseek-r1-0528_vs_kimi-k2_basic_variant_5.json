Player 0 offers 1 Ore + 2 Brick \u2192 8 Wood (I reject, visible values).  \n   \u20131 Ore (\u201335) \u20132 Brick (\u201360) = \u201395  \n   +8 Wood (+64) = \u201331 for me, so I was right to reject.\n\n5. Silence.\n\n6. Silence.\n\n7. My second accepted offer: I give 7 Wood+2 Sheep, receive 2 Ore+1 Brick  \n   \u20137 Wood (\u201356) \u20132 Sheep (\u201330) \u2192 \u201386  \n   +2 Ore (+70) +1 Brick (+30) \u2192 +100  \n   Net \u0394 = +14  \u2192  1 446\n\nAfter two accepted deals my stash is  \n+15 Wheat, +15 Wood, +13 Sheep, +14 Brick, +9 Ore \u2014 total 1 446 so I\u2019m 24 points ahead of my starting position with three turns still to go.\n\nObserved (implicit) values  \n\u2022 Player 0 parted with Brick for \u226430 value per unit and with Ore at \u226435 value per unit when receiving Sheep.  \n\u2022 He won\u2019t pay 1 Ore \u2248 42 \u201cworth\u201d of Wood (he wanted 8 Wood for 1 Ore).  \nSo my relative \u201ccheap\u201d resources to ship are Wood and Wheat, while the best things to pick up cheaply are Ore and Brick.\n\nNext move (Turn 8) \u2013 maximize the profit while keeping pieces Player 0 likes (Sheep, Brick):\n\nI\u2019ll offer something that gives Wood (his over-valued good) and Wheat but pulls Ore / Brick.\nI currently have 15 Wheat, 15 Wood, 13 Sheep, 14 Brick, 9 Ore.  Offering 8 Wheat + 8 Wood and asking 2 Ore + 1 Brick gives me still acceptable proportions and uses his apparent preference.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 8 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]",

The offer (8 Wheat and 8 Wood in exchange for 2 Ore and 1 Brick) yields a significant net gain in value for me, leveraging the inherent per-unit values:\n\n- Wheat greatly appreciates when we trade for higher-value items since we value each Wheat at 1.\n- Wood is relatively low-value for them (worth \u22481.83 per unit for us).\n- Ore is moderately valuable to us (1.5 per unit), but we have ample supply.\n- Brick is highly valuable (\u22482.42 per unit), but giving one is manageable given our stock.\n\nPlayer1, I appreciate you advancing our trades proactively! This deal aligns well with my inventory distribution goals. I'm happy to proceed.\n\n[Accept]",
