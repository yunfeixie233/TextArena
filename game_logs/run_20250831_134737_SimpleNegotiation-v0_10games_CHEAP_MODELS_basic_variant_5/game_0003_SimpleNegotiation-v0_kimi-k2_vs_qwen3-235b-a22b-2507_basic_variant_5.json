      "response": "I'll start the negotiation. Looking at my resources, I have the most quantities of Brick (24) and Ore (19), while I have relatively few Sheep (6). Given that Sheep has a high value (18 per unit), and I have plenty of Brick which has value 24, I could consider trading Brick away to get more Sheep.\n\nLet me make an offer to maximize both our values:\n\nHi Player 1! I have plenty of Brick and Ore, and I'm looking to acquire more Sheep. I'm offering some of my high-value Brick in exchange for Sheep. Here's my offer:\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 1 Sheep, 2 Brick]\n\nThis means you'll receive 5 Brick (value 120 total) in exchange for 1 Sheep (value 18) plus returning 2 Brick (value 48), so your net gain is 3 Brick (value 72) for 1 Sheep (value 18), giving you a profit of 54 points!\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nYour friendly neighbor,\nPlayer 0",
