I need to make a new offer that is more appealing to Player 1, potentially by offering a better deal for them than the previous one, or by changing the items being traded.\n\nGiven my goal is to increase the value of my resources, I should aim to trade away lower-value resources for higher-value ones. My current highest value resource is Ore (40), followed by Brick (24), Sheep (15), Wood (8), and Wheat (6).\n\nI previously offered Brick and Sheep for Ore. I still want more Ore.\nLet's try to offer a better deal regarding the ratio of offered to requested value, or simply offer higher quantities of my lower value resources.\n\nConsider offering more Brick or Sheep, or perhaps some Wheat or Wood, in exchange for Ore.\nI have a good quantity of Brick (20), Sheep (19), and Wheat (15).\n\nLet's try a different combination, perhaps slightly increasing the value offered for the same amount of Ore, or decreasing the amount of Ore requested for a similar value of offered items.\n\nOffer: 12 Brick, 5 Sheep -> 8 Ore\nValue offered: (12 * 24) + (5 * 15) = 288 + 75 = 363\nValue requested: (8 * 40) = 320\nThis offer is significantly less beneficial to me (363 offered for 320 received). Is it too much? I'm trying to make a trade happen.\n\nLet's rethink. If Player 1 rejected the previous offer, they might want either less of their high-value resource or more of my high-value resources.\n\nMaybe try to trade for a resource type that Player 1 might value more (e.g., if they are low on a specific resource). Since I don't know Player 1's resources, I have to guess.\n\nLet's consider trading my less valuable resources if possible.\nWhat if I try to get some Ore for Wheat and Wood?\nFor example, 10 Wheat (60) + 10 Wood (80) = 140 value for 3 Ore (120 value)?\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 3 Ore]\nThis is 140 value offered for 120 value received. It is still a loss for me.\n\nThe goal is to increase my own value. This means Requested Value > Offered Value for me.\nThe previous offer was: Offer (315) -> Request (320). This was advantageous for me. Player 1 rejected it.\nThis implies Player 1 believed the trade was not good enough for them.\n\nSo, I need to offer something where my 'loss' in value is smaller, or Player 1's gain is larger.\n\nNew Offer: Let's try to get Ore again, but be slightly more generous with Brick.\n[Offer: 12 Brick, 4 Sheep -> 8 Ore]\nValue offered: (12 * 24) + (4 * 15) = 288 + 60 = 348\nValue requested: (8 * 40) = 320\nStill a loss for me to make Player 1 accept. I am offering 348 value to get 320 value. This feels like I'm getting played.\n\nLet's try going for a smaller amount of Ore, or a different resource altogether, such as getting more Brick, which is my second-highest value resource.\n\nI have 20 Brick. I'm okay with having more Brick, but I prefer Ore.\nIf I'm trying to increase my total value, I need to make trades where the requested value is higher than the offered value.\n\nPlayer 1 rejected \"10 Brick, 5 Sheep -> 8 Ore\".\nValue offered: 315. Value requested: 320. (My gain: 5)\nFor Player 1, they would lose 320 value to gain 315 value. (Player 1's loss: 5). This is why they rejected it.\n\nI need to make the trade such that Player 1 sees a gain or minimises their loss.\nSo, the requested value must be lower than the offered value from Player 1's perspective.\nFrom my perspective, my requested value > my offered value. This means I need to make Player 1's requested value < Player 1's offered value.\nBasically, requested value for me < offered value for me is a losing trade.\n\nThe reverse logic: The value of what I get should be higher than the value of what I give.\nPlayer 1 must get more value than they give up.\n\nLet's try a small trade to gauge Player 1's willingness.\nHow about a direct swap of a low value item for a high value item, even if it's not a lot.\nExample: 20 Wheat (120) for 3 Ore (120). This is a fair trade by value.\n[Offer: 20 Wheat -> 3 Ore]\nValue offered: 20 * 6 = 120\nValue requested: 3 * 40 = 120\nThis is a neutral trade in terms of value. I have plenty of Wheat. This gets me some Ore.\nI have 15 Wheat. I cannot offer 20.\n\nLet's try with 15 Wheat.\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\nValue offered: 15 * 6 = 90\nValue requested: 2 * 40 = 80\nThis is a losing trade for me. (90 value for 80 value)\n\nMaybe Player 1 wants Brick? Or Sheep?\nWhat if I offer high-value items for higher-value items?\nFor example, trading Sheep for Ore. My Sheep value is 15. Ore value is 40.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 3 * 15 = 45\nValue requested: 1 * 40 = 40\nThis is also a losing trade for me (I give 45 value to get 40 value).\n\nI need to make a trade where I get more value than I give.\nLet's re-evaluate the target of 8 Ore from before.\nRequested value: 8 Ore = 320.\nPrevious offer was 10 Brick, 5 Sheep = 315. Player 1 rejected.\n\nSo Player 1 needs to gain more than 5 value. Or their loss needs to be reduced to 0 or less.\nIf they accepted the offer, they would lose 5 value.\nI need Player 1 to perceive a gain, or a neutral trade at minimum.\n\nSo my \"proposed gain\" is Player 1's \"proposed loss\".\nFor Player 1 to accept, my proposed gain must be 0 or negative (meaning I lose value).\nThis is tricky. I need to increase my total value, but I might need to make slightly losing trades to get to a better resource composition.\n\nLet's make a new offer that is more beneficial to Player 1, but still good enough for me.\nThe previous offer was 10 Brick (240) + 5 Sheep (75) = 315.\nRequested 8 Ore (320).\nPlayer 1 rejected.\n\nSo Player 1 considers giving 8 Ore for 315 value as a bad deal for them.\nThey would need more for their 8 Ore, OR they would give less Ore for the same amount.\n\nApproach 1: Reduce the requested Ore for the same offered items.\n[Offer: 10 Brick, 5 Sheep -> 7 Ore]\nValue offered: 315\nValue requested: 7 * 40 = 280\nThis is a significant loss for me (315 value given for 280 value received). This means I am reducing my total value.\n\nApproach 2: Increase the offered items for the same requested Ore, such that Player 1 values the offered items more.\nLet's assume Player 1 is also trying to make a profit.\nI need to reverse the previous profit of 5 (for me) to a loss of 5 or more (for me).\nSo, if I offered 325 value for 320 value (8 Ore), it would be a loss of 5 for me. Player 1 would gain 5. This should be acceptable for Player 1.\nHow about: [Offer: 11 Brick, 5 Sheep -> 8 Ore]\nValue offered: (11 * 24) + (5 * 15) = 264 + 75 = 339\nValue requested: 8 * 40 = 320\nThis is a losing trade for me (339 for 320). I lose 19 value. This means Player 1 gains 19 value. This should surely be accepted.\n\nLet's consider a smaller loss for myself.\nValue requested for me should be *at least* the value offered.\nThis means: Requested Value > Offered Value (for me).\nThis implies: (Value of my requested resource) - (Value of my offered resource) > 0.\n\nSo, the previous offer was 320 - 315 = +5 (for me). Rejected by Player 1.\nI need to make an offer that is \"better\" for Player 1 than this.\nThis means Player 1 needs to gain value.\nSo, the value of what I give > the value of what I receive FROM PLAYER 1's perspective.\nThis means the value of what I receive < value of what I give. This is a net negative for me.\n\nThis is a negotiation game, so it might be a loss for me on individual trades to improve my resource composition.\n\nI am trying to trade low-value resources for high-value resources. Wheat (6), Wood (8), Sheep (15), Brick (24), Ore (40).\nMy plan is to get more Ore. Ore is the highest value.\n\nLet's try to make a trade where the difference is very small.\nWhat if I offer a very slightly higher value for 8 Ore?\nPrevious offer was 315 for 8 Ore (320).\nWhat if I offer 320 value for 8 Ore (320)? It's a fair trade.\n\n[Offer: 10 Brick, 6 Sheep -> 8 Ore]\nValue offered: (10 * 24) + (6 * 15) = 240 + 90 = 330\nValue requested: 8 * 40 = 320\nThis means I am offering 330 value to receive 320 value. I lose 10 points. Player 1 gains 10 points.\nThis should be acceptable for Player 1.\nI have plenty of Brick (20) and Sheep (19). Selling 10 Brick and 6 Sheep reduces my current stock to 10 Brick and 13 Sheep. I gain 8 Ore, increasing my Ore to 19. This is a good resource reallocation, even with a small value loss.\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\nMy current resources:\nWheat: 15 (90)\nWood: 10 (80)\nSheep: 19 (285)\nBrick: 20 (480)\nOre: 11 (440)\nTotal: 1375\n\nIf this trade goes through:\nWheat: 15 (90)\nWood: 10 (80)\nSheep: 13 (195)\nBrick: 10 (240)\nOre: 19 (760)\nNew Total: 1365. This is a net loss of 10.\n\nIs it worth it? Yes, if it is the only way to get Ore.\nMy goal is to increase my total value in the overall game. Sometimes a small loss in one turn can lead to greater gains if it improves my resource quality for future trades.\nHaving more concentrated high-value resources is good.\n\nI need to make the offer.\n[Offer: 10 Brick, 6 Sheep -> 8 Ore]",
