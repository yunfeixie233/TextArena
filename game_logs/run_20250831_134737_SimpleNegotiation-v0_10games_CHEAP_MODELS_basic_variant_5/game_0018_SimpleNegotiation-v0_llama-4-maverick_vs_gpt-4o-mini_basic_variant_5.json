      "response": "### Analysis of Current Resources and Previous Trade\n\nAfter the first trade with Player 1, let's analyze the current state of my resources:\n\nInitially, I had:\n- Wheat: 22 units, Value: 5\n- Wood: 14 units, Value: 12\n- Sheep: 5 units, Value: 15\n- Brick: 21 units, Value: 29\n- Ore: 10 units, Value: 37\n\nThe trade was: 8 Wheat -> 2 Ore\n\nSo, after the trade:\n- Wheat: 22 - 8 = 14 units\n- Ore: 10 + 2 = 12 units\n- Other resources remain the same.\n\nNew quantities and total values:\n- Wheat: 14 units, Total Value: 14 * 5 = 70\n- Wood: 14 units, Total Value: 14 * 12 = 168\n- Sheep: 5 units, Total Value: 5 * 15 = 75\n- Brick: 21 units, Total Value: 21 * 29 = 609\n- Ore: 12 units, Total Value: 12 * 37 = 444\n\nTotal value of my resources now: 70 + 168 + 75 + 609 + 444 = 1366\n\n### Planning the Next Move\n\nTo maximize the total value, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value if possible. Currently, my resources in descending order of value per unit are: Ore (37), Brick (29), Sheep (15), Wood (12), and Wheat (5).\n\nSince I've acquired more Ore, which is one of the highest value resources, I should consider trading some of the lower-value resources for more Ore or keeping a balance that could be beneficial.\n\n### Evaluating Potential Trades\n\n1. **Trading Wheat**: I have 14 units left. Trading some Wheat for higher-value resources could be beneficial.\n2. **Trading Wood**: I have a considerable amount of Wood. Trading it for Ore or Brick could be a good move.\n\n### Making a Trade Offer\n\nLet's consider trading some Wood for Ore since Ore has a higher value per unit. I have 14 Wood, and its value is 12 per unit. If I can trade it for Ore, it would be beneficial.\n\nLet's offer 4 Wood for 1 Ore. The value given away is 4 * 12 = 48, and the value received is 1 * 37 = 37. Although this isn't a straightforward gain, it slightly diversifies my higher-value resources.\n\nHowever, let's directly try to negotiate for a slightly better deal.\n\n### Trade Offer to Player 1\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Ore]`\n\nThis offer gives away 4 * 12 = 48 in value and gains 2 * 37 = 74, which is a positive gain.\n\nLet's wait for Player 1's response.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wood,  -> 2 Ore]` is the same as `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Ore]`. So the action is: \n`[Offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Ore]`",
