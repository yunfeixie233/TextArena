This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety. Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach.

This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety.

This move will allow me to challenge Black's position in the center while improving my own piece activity. Specifically, I'll move my knight from b1 to c3, which develops a piece, attacks the knight on e4, and prepares for future kingside castling once my bishop is moved.\n\nMy move: [b1c3]\n[GAME] Player 0 made the following move: b1c3\n[GAME] Current board:\n   +-----------------+\n 8 | r n b q k b . r |\n 7 | p p p p . . p p |\n 6 | . . . . p . . . |\n 5 | . . . . . . . . |\n 4 | . . . . n . . . |\n 3 | . .

Moving my bishop from f1 to c4 develops a key piece, eyes the long diagonal towards Black's kingside, and prepares for potential attacks while supporting my position for kingside castling.\n\nMy move: [f1c4]\n[GAME] Player 0 made the following move: f1c4\n[GAME] Current board:\n   +-----------------+\n 8 | r n b q k b . r |\n 7 | p p p p . . p p |\n 6 | . . . . p n . . |\n 5 | . . . . . . . . |\n 4 | . .
