This aligns with Example 3's emphasis on piece activity.\n- **Alternatives**: \n  - [b1c3] develops the queenside knight but leaves the kingside underdeveloped.\n  - [f1c4] or [f1b5] develops the bishop but is premature before knights (may expose it).\n  - Pawn moves like [d2d4] solidify the center but delay development.\n\n**Decision**: [g1f3] is strongest because:\n1. Develops a knight with tempo (threatens future attacks).\n2. Maintains central control after [e2e4].\n3. Avoids early queen moves (e.g., [d1h5]) that risk tempo loss.\n\n**Move**: [g1f3]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Illegal move: g8h6. This move is not legal in the current position.

Here's my analysis:\n\n1. **Tactical evaluation**: Black's knight on h6 is passive and doesn't threaten the center. I should capitalize by developing aggressively.\n2. **Optimal development**: [g1f3] develops a knight while:\n   - Controlling critical central squares (e5/d4)\n   - Preparing kingside castling\n   - Maintaining pressure for future attacks\n   - Aligns perfectly with Example 3's knight development principle\n3. **Why not alternatives**:\n   - [f1c4]/[f1b5]: Premature bishop development risks exposure\n   - [b1c3]: Less urgent than kingside development\n   - [d2d4]/[e4e5]: Overextending without full development\n   - Queen moves ([d1h5], etc.): Violate opening principles (Example 1)\n\n**Move selection**: [g1f3] is textbook development - it mobilizes pieces efficiently and keeps the initiative.\n\n**Formatted move**: [g1f3]\n[GAME] Player 0 made the following move: g1f3\n[GAME] Current board:\n   +-----------------+\n 8 | r n b q k b . r |\n 7 | p p p p p p p p |\n 6 | . . . . . . . n |\n 5 | . . . . . . . . |\n 4 | . . . .

This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety. Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach.

This follows opening principles from Examples 1-3.\n- **Alternatives**:\n  - Bishop development ([f1c4]) is tempting but premature\u2014knights should typically develop first.\n  - Pawn advances ([d2d4]) solidify the center but delay castling preparation.\n  - Knight maneuvers ([f3g5]) attack h6 but risk tempo loss if Black defends simply (e.g., ...g6).\n- **Avoid**: Passive moves like [h2h3] or premature queen activity.\n\n**Optimal move**: [b1c3]  \n- Develops a piece with purpose  \n- Prepares queenside castling options  \n- Maintains initiative without overextending  \n\n**Formatted move**: [b1c3]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Illegal move: h8g8.

      "response": "[White] As White, I'll prioritize piece development and center control. Black's last move [h8g8] (though flagged as invalid, the board reflects it) is purely defensive and neglects active play. My analysis:\n\n1. **Critical development move**: [b1c3] is essential\u2014it develops the queenside knight to control central squares (d5/e4), prepares queenside castling options, and follows opening principles from the examples.\n\n2. **Why not alternatives**:\n   - Bishop moves ([f1c4]/[f1b5]): Premature without full knight development; risks exposure if Black challenges the center.\n   - Pawn moves ([d2d4]/[e4e5]): Overextend before castling safety is established.\n   - Knight maneuvers ([f3g5]): Attack the weak h6 knight but lose tempo if Black counters with ...g6.\n   - Passive moves ([h2h3]): Wasted tempo, as in Example 1.\n\n3. **Tactical opportunity**: The pinned h6 knight (after Bh6) is a future target, but immediate aggression is unnecessary\u2014fast development is superior.\n\n**Move**: [b1c3] develops a piece, reinforces the center (d5/e4), and maintains fluidity.  \nFormatted: [b1c3]",
