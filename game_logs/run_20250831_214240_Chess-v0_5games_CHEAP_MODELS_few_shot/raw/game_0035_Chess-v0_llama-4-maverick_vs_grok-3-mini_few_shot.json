This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety. Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach.

The most popular and strategic opening moves involve playing 'e2e4' or 'd2d4', as they open up the center and allow for quick development.\n\nI'll choose '[e2e4]' as my first move because it not only controls a central square but also opens up the diagonal for my dark-squared bishop and the possibility of developing other pieces more quickly.\n\nMy move: [e2e4]\n[GAME] Player 0 made the following move: e2e4\n[GAME] Current board:\n   +-----------------+\n 8 | r n b q k b n r |\n 7 | p p p p p p p p |\n 6 | . . . . . . . . |\n 5 | . . . . . . . . |\n 4 | . . . .
