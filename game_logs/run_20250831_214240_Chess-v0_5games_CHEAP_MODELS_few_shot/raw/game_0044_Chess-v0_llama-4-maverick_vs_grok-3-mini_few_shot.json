This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety. Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach.
