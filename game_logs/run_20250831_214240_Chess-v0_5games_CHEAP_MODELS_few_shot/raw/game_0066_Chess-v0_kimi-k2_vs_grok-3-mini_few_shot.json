This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety. Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach.

This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety. Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach.

This creates immediate pressure and potential attacking chances for White. As Black, I must address this threat while developing my pieces and seeking counterplay. Playing [d8f6] develops my queen to a strong central square, directly attacks White's queen on g4, and increases my control over the board.

This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety. Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach.

This creates immediate pressure and potential attacking chances for White. As Black, I must address this threat while developing my pieces and seeking counterplay. Playing [d8f6] develops my queen to a strong central square, directly attacks White's queen on g4, and increases my control over the board. This move also supports my knight on e4 and prepares for further defensive or tactical opportunities, such as potential forks or attacks on White's center.\n\n[d8f6]\n[GAME] Player 1 made the following move: d8f6\n[GAME] Current board:\n   +-----------------+\n 8 | r . . . k b . r |\n 7 | p p p . . p p p |\n 6 | . . p . . q . . |\n 5 | . . . . . . . . |\n 4 | . .

However, h7 is already covered by the queen, and the only real targets are f7 (still defended by the king) and the advanced knight on e4 (protected by both queen and pawn).\n\nRather than moving my queen again, I choose a simple developing move that castles, safeguards my king, and connects my rooks.\n\n[e1g1]\n[GAME] Player 0 made the following move: e1g1\n[GAME] Current board:\n   +-----------------+\n 8 | r . . . k b . r |\n 7 | p p p . . p p p |\n 6 | . . p . . q . . |\n 5 | . . . . . . . . |\n 4 | . .
