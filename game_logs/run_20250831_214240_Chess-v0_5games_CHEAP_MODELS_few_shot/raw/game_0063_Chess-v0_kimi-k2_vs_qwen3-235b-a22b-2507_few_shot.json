This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety. Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach.

This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety.

This is a common fork threat (knight eyeing f7 for a potential fork on h6 or capturing on f7 if undefended).

The best move is **[d7d6]**, which blocks the knight's attack on f7 and supports the e5 pawn while opening the bishop's diagonal.\n\nPlaying [g7g6] also fights for the center and prepares to develop the bishop, but it weakens the dark squares around the king and doesn\u2019t directly address the immediate pressure.\n\nBetter is **[d7d6]** to solidify the center and kick the knight.\n\n[d7d6]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Illegal move: f3g5.

This is better than '[h2h3]' which wastes time on the edge.\n\nExample 2: When your king is in danger, prioritize safety. Castling with '[e1g1]' moves your king to safety behind pawns.\n\nExample 3: Look for tactical opportunities. If opponent's queen is undefended, move your knight with '[g1f3]' to attack it and gain material advantage.\n\nMake your moves in UCI format enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [e2e4]).\n\nInvalid moves include same-square moves (e.g. [e8e8]) and moves to squares you cannot reach.
