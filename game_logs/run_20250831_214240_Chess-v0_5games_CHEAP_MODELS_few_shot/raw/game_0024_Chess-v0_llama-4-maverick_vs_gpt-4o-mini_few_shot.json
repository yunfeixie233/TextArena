However, this would also simplify the position and give Black a chance to develop their pieces more easily.\n\nAnother option is to develop my pieces. [g1f3] is a good move as it develops my knight, prepares to control the center, and supports the d4 pawn indirectly. It also has the potential to develop other pieces more effectively in the subsequent moves.\n\nLet's choose [g1f3] as it is a solid and strategic move that fits into a broader plan of development and central control.\n\nThe move is: [g1f3]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Illegal move: e7e5.
