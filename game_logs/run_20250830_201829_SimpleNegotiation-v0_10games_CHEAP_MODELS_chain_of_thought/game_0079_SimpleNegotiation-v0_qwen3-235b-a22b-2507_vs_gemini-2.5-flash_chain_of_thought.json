      "response": "My current resources are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 14   Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 24   Value: 12\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 19   Value: 15\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 5    Value: 27\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 13   Value: 40\n\nI want to increase the total value of my resources. This means I should try to trade resources I value less for resources I value more.\n\nLet's look at the values:\nWheat: 6 (lowest)\nWood: 12\nSheep: 15\nBrick: 27\nOre: 40 (highest)\n\nI have a good quantity of Wood, and it's relatively low value. I also have a fair amount of Sheep. I have very little Brick, but it's high value, and a decent amount of Ore, which is the highest value.\n\nMy strategy will be to trade lower-value resources (like Wood and Wheat) for higher-value resources (like Ore and Brick). I'll also try to consolidate. For example, trading multiple units of a mid-value resource for a single unit of a high-value resource.\n\nGiven Player 0 made no new trade offer, I should make one.\n\nI have 24 Wood (value 12) and 19 Sheep (value 15). I have only 5 Brick (value 27) and 13 Ore (value 40). My goal is to get more Brick and Ore.\n\nLet's try to offer a quantity of Wood and Sheep for some Brick or Ore.\n\nOption 1: Offer Wood for Brick. 2 Wood (2*12=24) is roughly equal to 1 Brick (27). But I want to make a profit.\nOption 2: Offer Wood for Ore. 3 Wood (3*12=36) is less than 1 Ore (40). I'd be losing.\n\nLet's aim for a favorable exchange rate. I want to spend less value to get more value.\n\nI will try to trade away some Wood and Sheep to get more Brick.\n\nOffer: 2 Wood (24) + 1 Sheep (15) = 39 value. I could ask for 1 Brick (27) + 1 Sheep (15) = 42? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI need to make sure the requested resource value is greater than the offered resource value in total.\n\nLet's try:\nOffer: 3 Wood (3 * 12 = 36 value) for 1 Brick (27 value). This is a bad trade for me. I'm trying to gain value.\n\nLet's aim for a trade where the requested item's value is significantly higher than the offered items' combined value.\n\nI have 24 Wood. It's a lower value item. I have only 5 Brick. I want more Brick.\nHow about offering a good chunk of Wood for a smaller amount of high-value resources?\n\nI will aim for an exchange where I give up resources with a total value X and receive resources with a total value Y, where Y > X.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood and Sheep for Brick.\nValue of 3 Sheep = 3 * 15 = 45 value.\nValue of 1 Brick = 27 value. Value of 2 Brick = 54 value.\nValue of 1 Ore = 40 value. Value of 2 Ore = 80 value.\n\nConsider 3 Sheep for 1 Ore. I give 45 value, get 40 value. Bad for me.\nConsider 2 Sheep (30 value) for 1 Brick (27 value). Also bad for me.\n\nMy strategy is to shed lower-value items for higher-value ones.\nI have a lot of Wood (24 units @ 12 value).\nI have a decent amount of Sheep (19 units @ 15 value).\n\nI want to acquire Brick (27 value) and Ore (40 value).\n\nLet's try to make a profitable offer.\n\nOffer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick\nValue offered: (3 * 12) + (2 * 15) = 36 + 30 = 66\nValue requested: 2 * 27 = 54\nThis is bad for me. I offer 66, request 54.\n\nI need to flip this. I want to request more value than I offer.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 3 Wood, 2 Sheep] (This is what I want, to receive 2 Brick)\nValue requested: 2 * 27 = 54\nValue offered by partner: (3 * 12) + (2 * 15) = 36 + 30 = 66\nThis would be a good trade for me, assuming my partner accepts offering more value than they receive in my suggested trade. However, as Player 1, I am making the offer. The format is `[Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]`. So my resources are on the left, partner's on the right.\n\nSo my offer has to be my resources going out, and the requested resources coming in.\n\nLet\u2019s try to give away Wood and Wheat (my lowest value items).\nI have 14 Wheat (6 value).\nI have 24 Wood (12 value).\n\nLet's offer a combination of Wheat and Wood for something more valuable.\nOffer: 8 Wheat (8 * 6 = 48) + 1 Wood (1 * 12 = 12) = 60 value.\nRequest: 1 Brick (27) + 1 Ore (40) = 67 value.\nThis looks like a good offer for me. I give 60, get 67.\nI have enough Wheat and Wood.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]",
