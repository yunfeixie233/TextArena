Perhaps they don't value Sheep and Wood as highly as I do, or they value Brick and Wheat more than I anticipate. I need to re-evaluate my offer to entice them.\n\nLet's calculate the value of my previous offer and request:\nMy previous offer: 10 Sheep (10 * 14 = 140) + 5 Wood (5 * 11 = 55) = 195\nMy previous request: 8 Brick (8 * 29 = 232) + 3 Wheat (3 * 6 = 18) = 250\nThe offer was beneficial for me, but maybe too much so for Player 1 to accept.\n\nI want to acquire more high-value resources like Ore and Brick. I have a good amount of Wood and Sheep. Wheat is low value, but I have a decent quantity.\n\nLet's try to offer a smaller amount of high value resources, or more of lower value resources to get what I want.\n\nPerhaps Player 1 has a lot of Brick and Wheat and is looking to get rid of them, or they have a shortage of Sheep and Wood. Their initial offer was 10 Sheep, 5 Wood for 8 Brick, 3 Wheat, which is exactly what I offered them. So they are looking for Sheep and Wood.\n\nSince Player 1 initiated an offer where they wanted 10 Sheep and 5 Wood, and I want 8 Brick and 3 Wheat, it means the issue is the quantity of Brick and Wheat. They refused to give me that.\n\nLet's try to offer Sheep and Wood for Ore instead, as Ore has a higher value.\nI will offer a significant amount of Wood and some Sheep, for a smaller amount of Ore.\n\nOffer: 15 Wood (15 * 11 = 165) + 5 Sheep (5 * 14 = 70) = 235\nRequest: 6 Ore (6 * 34 = 204)\nThis is a slightly less greedy offer for me, as the value of what I'm offering (235) is higher than what I'm requesting (204). This might make it more appealing to Player 1.\n[Offer: 15 Wood, 5 Sheep -> 6 Ore]",
