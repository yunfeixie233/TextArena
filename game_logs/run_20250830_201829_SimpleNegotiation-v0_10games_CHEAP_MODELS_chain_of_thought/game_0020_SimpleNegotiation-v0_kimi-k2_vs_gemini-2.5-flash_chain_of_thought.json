Ore (highest value, 39 per unit) \u2013 **do NOT trade away unless gaining significant value**.  \n  2. Brick (23 per unit) \u2013 High value but less than Ore.  \n  3. Sheep/Wood (13 and 11) \u2013 Moderate value; can be used to trade up.  \n  4. Wheat (6) \u2013 Lowest value; ideal for padding trades.  \n\n- **Trade Goal**: Target **Brick or Ore** to maximize per-unit value. I have excess Sheep (20) and Wheat (20), which are weaker.  \n\n- **Opponent Strategy**: Assume the opponent (Player 1) follows similar logic. They likely want Ore/Brick and may offer Sheep/Wheat/Wood.  \n\n---\n\n### Turn-by-Turn Plan  \n**Hypothetical Opponent Holdings** (estimated):  \n| Resource | Qty | Value |  \n|----------|-----|-------|  \n| Wheat    | 8   | 6     |  \n| Wood     | 11  | 11    |  \n| Sheep    | 7   | 13    |  \n| Brick    | 10  | 23    |  \n| Ore      | 6   | 39    |  \n\n**Focus**: Trade 2-3 Sheep + 1 Wheat for 2 Brick or 1 Ore.  \n\n---\n\n### Turn 1 Dialogue  \n**Player 0 (Me)**:  \n\"Hey!
