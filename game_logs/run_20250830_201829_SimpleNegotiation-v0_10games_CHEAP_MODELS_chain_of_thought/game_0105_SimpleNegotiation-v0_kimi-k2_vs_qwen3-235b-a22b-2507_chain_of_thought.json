Brick is abundant and can be traded for Ore.\n   - **Previous Offers**:\n     - Offered 3 Brick (66 value) for 1 Ore (39 value) \u2192 rejected. This was a fair trade (3 Brick = 66 vs. 1 Ore = 39), but Player 1 rejected it, likely because they value Ore highly or don't need Brick.\n     - Need to adjust the offer to make it more appealing to Player 1.\n\n3. **New Offer Design**:\n   - **Problem**: Player 1 rejected 3 Brick for 1 Ore. They might want more Brick or a different resource.\n   - **Solution**: Offer more Brick (4 Brick = 88 value) for 1 Ore (39 value). This is a significant overpay (88 vs. 39), but it might entice Player 1 to accept.\n   - **Alternative**: Include Wheat (low-value for me) to sweeten the deal. For example, 4 Brick + 1 Wheat (88 + 6 = 94) for 1 Ore (39). This is even more overpaying, but Ore is critical for increasing total value.\n\n4. **Final Decision**:\n   - The simplest overpay is 4 Brick for 1 Ore. This is straightforward and might be accepted if Player 1 has spare Ore.\n\nFinal Answer: [Offer: 4 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
