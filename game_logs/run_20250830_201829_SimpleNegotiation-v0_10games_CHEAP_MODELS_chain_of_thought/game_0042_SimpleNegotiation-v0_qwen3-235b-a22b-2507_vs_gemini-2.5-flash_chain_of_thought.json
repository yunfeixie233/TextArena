Player 0 has continually rejected my offers. Player 0 previously offered 5 Brick for 5 Sheep and 3 Wheat, which was a good trade for them (5*28=140 vs 5*13+3*5=80). I rejected. My last offer was 1 Brick for 2 Sheep and 2 Wheat (28 vs 2*13+2*5=36), which would have been a gain of 8.\n\nI'm trying to gain value. The value of my resources are:\nWheat: 5\nWood: 12\nSheep: 13\nBrick: 28\nOre: 39\n\nPerhaps Player 0 is looking for higher quantities of resources to make a trade worth their while, or they have a different internal valuation. I have a lot of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep. My Brick is quite valuable, and Ore is the most valuable.\n\nLet's try to offer a bit more of my less valuable resources to get something more valuable, or at least break even. Or maybe offer a different resource than Brick.\n\nLet's try offering Wood and Sheep, which I have in good quantities, for something more valuable like Ore or Brick.\n\nConsider this: I have 25 Sheep, 19 Wheat, 17 Wood.\nIf I offer 3 Wood and 3 Wheat (3*12 + 3*5 = 36+15 = 51) for 1 Ore (39), it's a loss for me.\nIf I offer 3 Wood (3*12 = 36) for 1 Ore (39), it's a slight gain for me. That's a good offer for me. Let's try that.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
