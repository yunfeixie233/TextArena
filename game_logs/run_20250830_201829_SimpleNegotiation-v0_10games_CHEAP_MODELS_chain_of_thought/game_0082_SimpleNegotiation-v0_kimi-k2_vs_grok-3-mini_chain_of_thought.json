I will decline unless they improve the brick/ore ratio.  \n\n[Deny]\n\nFor my turn, I will try a more compact offer that still moves brick to me and ore to them: I send 3 Ore for 4 Brick and 1 extra Wood to better cover the value gap, which is an even swap of total points (3\u00d732 = 96 vs 4\u00d724 + 9\u00d71 = 96).\n\n[Offer: 3 Ore -> 4 Brick, 1 Wood]",
