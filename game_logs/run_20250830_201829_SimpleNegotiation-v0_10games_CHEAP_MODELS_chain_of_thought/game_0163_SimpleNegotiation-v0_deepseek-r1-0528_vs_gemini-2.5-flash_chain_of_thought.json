      "response": "Based on the previous interaction, I see that my initial offer of 5 Wheat for 1 Ore was rejected, likely because the opponent valued that exchange negatively. To increase the total value of my resources, I need to propose a more balanced trade that offers mutual benefits\u2014even if the gain is incremental. My current resource valuations indicate that Wood (8 each) and Wheat (5 each) are lower-value compared to Ore (33) and Sheep (18). \n\nI propose trading a combination of Wheat and Wood for Ore and Sheep. Specifically:  \n- Offering **5 Wheat and 3 Wood** (total value: 5*5 + 3*8 = 25 + 24 = 49) in exchange for **1 Ore and 1 Sheep** (total value: 33 + 18 = 51).  \nThis results in a **small net gain of 2 value** for me (51 - 49 = 2), while the opponent receives resources that may better suit their strategy. I have ample Wheat (16) and Wood (16) to spare, and securing an additional Ore and Sheep improves my higher-value holdings.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]",
