However, Ore is the single scarcest and highest-value resource for me; giving away any more of it risks pushing my Ore count far below equilibrium. With other players repeatedly asking for Ore, holding the line on Ore stock may outweigh the marginal gain 40 units prior plus the chance to gain 8 even scarcer Bricks. I choose not to trade away more Ore at this rate.\n\n[Deny]",
