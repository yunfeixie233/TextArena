Both of us have already passed through Turns 2 \u2192 4 without sending any new offers; Player 1 keeps rejecting the old ones.  \n2. I do NOT actually need more Sheep (I have 20); I over-offered in my first trade.  \n3. My marginal utility for Wheat is high (I only have 5), Wood is moderate (5), and I have plenty of Brick (25) plus good Ore (9).  \n4. Player 1 clearly isn\u2019t interested in giving away Wheat/Wood/Brick for Sheep; I must pivot to a different resource.\n\nGoal: increase value. The most straightforward way in this static valuation is to swap excess Brick (value 21) for Wood (10) or Wheat (5) 1-for-2, or for Ore (32) 1-for-1.  \nIt\u2019s be better to pick a resource that Player 1 might already have excess of. Wheat and Wood are often the \u201cscarce\u201d ones in Catan-style games, so I\u2019ll target Ore instead: Brick for Ore gives a +11 value swing per piece; a small favour for them (+Brick) in return for a big bump for me.\n\nProposed offer: 4 of my Brick (4\u00d721 = 84 value) for 3 of their Ore (3\u00d732 = 96 value).
