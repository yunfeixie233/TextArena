Good trade!\n\n**New Inventory After Trade:**\n- Wheat: 6 + 10 = 16\n- Wood: 9 + 10 = 19\n- Sheep: 10 - 3 = 7\n- Brick: 15 - 5 = 10\n- Ore: 20 (unchanged)\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\nNow my Wheat and Wood have increased. Wheat has the lowest value per unit (0.83), and Wood is mid-tier (1.33). Brick is valuable (1.93), and Ore is highest (37/20 = 1.85). Sheep is lowest at 1.2. I should try to consolidate high-value resources by trading excess low-value ones.\n\n**Trade Offer Proposal:**\nI have 16 Wheat (highest qty but lowest value) and 19 Wood (also high qty). I want more Ore and maybe Brick. I can offer some Wheat and Wood for Ore/Brick to increase my total value.\n\nLet me offer: [Offer: 8 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 4 Ore, 2 Brick]",
