      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n- Current resources and their values:\n  - [Wheat]: Qty = 9, Value = 5\n  - [Wood]: Qty = 13, Value = 10\n  - [Sheep]: Qty = 21, Value = 14\n  - [Brick]: Qty = 6, Value = 30\n  - [Ore]: Qty = 18, Value = 40\n\n- Total current value = (9*5) + (13*10) + (21*14) + (6*30) + (18*40) = 45 + 130 + 294 + 180 + 720 = 1369\n\n### Negotiation Strategy\nTo increase the total value of resources, we need to identify potentially beneficial trades. We should aim to acquire resources with higher values or increase the quantity of resources we already have that have high values.\n\n### Initial Offer Consideration\nLet's analyze the current resource values:\n- The highest value resource we have is [Ore] with a value of 40 per unit.\n- We should consider not trading away too much [Ore] unless we get a significantly better deal.\n\n### Potential Trades\n1. **Trades involving [Ore]**: We could offer some [Sheep] or [Wood] for more valuable resources or more quantity of a resource.\n\n2. **Trading for [Brick]**: Since [Brick] has a high value (30), increasing its quantity could be beneficial. We currently have 6 [Brick].\n\n### Initial Offer\nLet's make an initial offer that could potentially increase our total value. We have a good quantity of [Sheep] and could potentially trade some for [Brick] since [Brick] is valuable.\n\n### Proposed Trade\nOffer: `[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]`\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 5 Sheep, 0 Ore, 0 Wheat, 0 Wood -> 2 Brick, 0 Sheep, 0 Ore, 0 Wood, 0 Wheat]`\n\nUsing the special token format: `[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]`\n\nLet's send: `[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]`\n\nThis is our action for Turn 1. We are offering 5 [Sheep] (Value = 14 each) for 2 [Brick] (Value = 30 each), which could be a reasonable trade given the values.\n\n### Reasoning\n- We are giving up 5 * 14 = 70 value units.\n- We are gaining 2 * 30 = 60 value units.\nThis specific trade is not favorable in terms of immediate value. Let's reconsider and adjust our strategy for a potentially better trade.\n\n### Reconsideration\nUpon further consideration, a more beneficial trade might involve acquiring more [Ore] or maintaining our current [Ore] level and trading other resources for higher value ones.\n\n### Alternative Trade\nLet's examine trading some [Wood] (Value = 10) for [Ore] (Value = 40), as this could significantly increase our total value.\n\n### Alternative Offer\nIf we had an opportunity to trade [Wood] for [Ore], it could be beneficial. For instance: `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's calculate: \n- Giving up 4 * 10 = 40 value units.\n- Gaining 1 * 40 = 40 value units.\n\nThis trade is value-neutral but could be a starting point.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\nLet's propose: `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis is a reasonable starting point. We will see how the opponent responds.\n\nLet's execute the action for Turn 1: `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]`",

Although this seems not beneficial at first glance because I'm giving away resources worth 80 for resources worth 60, it's actually not a good trade for me. I need to think of a better option.\n\nA potentially good trade could be offering some Sheep for Ore or Brick, as I have a lot of Sheep.\n\nLet's consider:\n- Offering 4 Sheep for 1 Ore (Value of 40). The value given is 4*14 = 56, which is more than the value received (40), so this isn't a good trade.\n- Offering 3 Sheep for 2 Brick. The value given is 3*14 = 42, and the value received is 2*30 = 60. This looks like a potentially good trade because I'm getting more value than I'm giving.\n\nThus, I will make the following offer:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\n\nThe action for this turn is: [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "## Step 1: Review the current state of resources after the previous turns.\nAfter the previous turns, we need to update the resources based on the trades made. Initially, Player 0 had:\n- Wheat: 9 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 13 (Value: 10)\n- Sheep: 21 (Value: 14)\n- Brick: 6 (Value: 30)\n- Ore: 18 (Value: 40)\n\nPlayer 0 made an offer to Player 1: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick, which was accepted. So, the updated resources for Player 0 are:\n- Sheep: 21 - 5 = 16\n- Brick: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nOther trades were either rejected or not accepted, so they didn't change the resources.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the current total value of resources for Player 0.\nLet's calculate the total value after the first accepted trade:\n- Wheat: 9 * 5 = 45\n- Wood: 13 * 10 = 130\n- Sheep: 16 * 14 = 224\n- Brick: 8 * 30 = 240\n- Ore: 18 * 40 = 720\nTotal value = 45 + 130 + 224 + 240 + 720 = 1359\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the last offers and counteroffers made by both players.\nThe last offer from Player 1 to Player 0 was: 2 Brick -> 5 Sheep. We rejected it. Our last offer to Player 1 was: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Ore, which was rejected.\n\n## Step 4: Consider potential trades for the next turn.\nTo increase the total value, we should look for trades that give us more valuable resources. We need to examine what we have and what we can offer or request.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the resources and think about a beneficial trade.\nWe have:\n- Plenty of Sheep and Ore, which are relatively valuable.\n- A decent amount of Wood.\n\nWe can consider offering some of our less valuable resources or a quantity of a valuable resource for something that could potentially increase our total value.\n\n## Step 6: Decide on a trade offer for the next turn.\nLet's examine possible trades:\n1. Offering Wood or Wheat for more valuable resources could be a good start since they are less valuable per unit.\n2. We could offer some Ore for a significant amount of Brick or other valuable resources.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a trade offer based on the current resources and values.\nConsidering our resources and the goal to increase total value, we could offer: [Offer: 4 Wood -> 3 Sheep]. However, we already have a lot of Sheep, so this might not be the best. Another option is to directly try to get more Ore or Brick since they are highly valued.\n\nLet's directly think about making an offer that involves our less valuable resources or negotiating for the more valuable ones.\n\n## Step 8: Make a trade offer.\nLet's offer something reasonable. Since Player 1 previously offered 2 Brick for 5 Sheep and we have Sheep, let's think about our next move carefully.\n\nGiven that we have 16 Sheep and 8 Brick, and considering the value, offering Sheep for Brick or Ore could be reasonable if the rate is right.\n\n## Step 9: Choose a specific trade to propose.\nWe could propose: [Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick] or something similar, checking if it's beneficial.\n\nFor [Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick]:\n- We give up: 4 * 14 = 56 value\n- We gain: 2 * 30 = 60 value\nThis trade slightly increases our value.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick]}$",
