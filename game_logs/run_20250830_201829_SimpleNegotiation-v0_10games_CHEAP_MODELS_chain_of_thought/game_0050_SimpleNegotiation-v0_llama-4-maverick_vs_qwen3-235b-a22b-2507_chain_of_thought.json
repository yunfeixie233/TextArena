      "response": "### Initial Assessment\nTo maximize the total value of my resources, I need to understand the current distribution and value of the resources I hold. Let's calculate the total value of my current resources.\n\n- Wheat: 10 * 5 = 50\n- Wood: 5 * 8 = 40\n- Sheep: 11 * 16 = 176\n- Brick: 9 * 29 = 261\n- Ore: 6 * 36 = 216\n\nTotal Value = 50 + 40 + 176 + 261 + 216 = 743\n\n### Strategy\nTo increase the total value, I should look for opportunities to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but with a potential for future gain. Given the values, Ore and Brick are the most valuable resources per unit, followed by Sheep.\n\n### Initial Offer Consideration\nSince Ore and Brick are highly valued, holding onto them unless there's a very favorable trade is a good strategy. Sheep is also relatively valuable. Let's examine potential trades:\n\n1. **Trading Wheat or Wood for more valuable resources**: Since Wheat and Wood are the least valuable resources per unit, trading them for more valuable resources could be beneficial.\n\n### First Turn Action\nI will start by proposing a trade that involves my least valuable resources. Let's try to trade Wheat or Wood for something more valuable.\n\nLet's offer: '[Offer: 5 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 3 Sheep]'.\n\nThis translates to: '[Offer: 5 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 3 Sheep]' = '[Offer: 40 (5*8) + 25 (5*5) -> 48 (3*16)]'.\n\nThe total value offered is 65, and the total value requested is 48. While this isn't a great trade in terms of immediate value gain, it's not a significant loss either, and gaining Sheep could be strategic. However, let's rethink this offer to be more favorable.\n\nLet's adjust the offer to be more balanced or slightly favorable: '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'.\n\nThis means giving up 4 Wheat (Value = 20) for 1 Sheep (Value = 16). Not ideal, but let's start with a simple trade.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'.\n\nLet's wait for a response. \n\nSince I made the initial offer, I will wait for the opponent's response on the next turn. \n\n### Next Steps\nI will evaluate the opponent's response on the next turn and adjust my strategy accordingly. If they accept, I'll assess the new distribution. If they deny or counteroffer, I'll decide based on the counteroffer or my next best trade. \n\nWaiting for opponent's response...",

We should aim to either retain or acquire more of these high-value resources.\n\n2. **Potential Trades**: Since our last offer was for 2 Sheep in exchange for 1 Ore and was rejected, we should consider if the terms were not favorable or if Player 1 simply doesn't have what we're asking for.\n\n3. **New Offer Consideration**: \n   - We could try to offer resources that we have in surplus or those that are less valuable to us in exchange for higher value resources.\n   - Given that Ore is our most valuable resource and we already have a considerable amount, acquiring more might not be as beneficial as ensuring we have a good mix of other valuable resources.\n\nLet's consider an alternative offer:\n\n- **[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]**  \n  - We are offering relatively lower value resources (Wheat and Wood) in exchange for a higher value resource (Brick).\n  - This could be an attractive offer since it increases our total value.\n\n### Action\n\nLet's make a new offer:  \n`[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n\n### Rationale\n\nBy offering 4 Wheat (value = 4*5 = 20) and 2 Wood (value = 2*8 = 16), totaling 36 in value, we are requesting 1 Brick (value = 29). While it seems we're offering more value than we're getting, the difference isn't drastic, and acquiring Brick is beneficial. However, let's correct the calculation and strategy to fit the goal of increasing total value:\n\n- Offering 4 Wheat and 2 Wood for 1 Brick means giving up 20 + 16 = 36 in value for 29 in value, which is not beneficial.\n\nLet's reconsider and directly propose a potentially more beneficial trade based on the available resources and the goal to increase total value.\n\n### Alternative Action\n\nRevisiting our resources and considering a more strategic offer that could be appealing and beneficial.\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`  \n- Giving up 3 Wheat (3*5 = 15) for 1 Sheep (1*16 = 16) is a slight gain.\n\nLet's execute this action.\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`",

      "response": "### Current Status\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\n- **Current Resources:**\n  - Wheat: 10 - 4 - 4 = 2\n  - Wood: 5 - 2 - 2 = 1\n  - Sheep: 11 - 2 = 9\n  - Brick: 9 + 1 + 1 = 11\n  - Ore: 6\n\n- **Initial Total Value:** (10 * 5) + (5 * 8) + (11 * 16) + (9 * 29) + (6 * 36) = 50 + 40 + 176 + 261 + 216 = 743\n- **Current Total Value:** (2 * 5) + (1 * 8) + (9 * 16) + (11 * 29) + (6 * 36) = 10 + 8 + 144 + 319 + 216 = 697\n\n### Observations\n\n1. The last trade offer made by Player 0 was accepted by Player 1, but it was a repeat offer. The previous turn's trade resulted in:\n   - Losing 4 Wheat, 2 Wood\n   - Gaining 1 Brick\n   - Net change in value: (4*5 + 2*8) - (1*29) = (20 + 16) - 29 = 36 - 29 = 7 (loss)\n\n2. The current resources are not being utilized efficiently for further trades. We need to re-evaluate our resources and consider a new trade that could be beneficial.\n\n### Strategy\n\nTo improve the total value, we should look for trades that give us resources with higher values or reduce the loss.\n\n1. **Resource Re-evaluation:**\n   - We have: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood, 9 Sheep, 11 Brick, 6 Ore\n   - Consider trading lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n2. **Potential Trades:**\n   - We could offer Wheat or Wood (lower value) for Sheep, Brick, or Ore (higher value). However, we are already low on Wheat and Wood.\n   - Consider offering Sheep (Value: 16) for Ore (Value: 36).\n\n### New Trade Offer\n\nLet's formulate a new trade offer:\n- Offer 2 Sheep (Value: 2*16 = 32)\n- Request 1 Ore (Value: 1*36 = 36)\n\nThe net gain in value for this trade would be: 36 - 32 = 4\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis trade has a positive expected value change.
