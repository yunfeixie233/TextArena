      "response": "Player 0, you have the following resources:\n- Wheat: 22 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 17 (Value: 11)\n- Sheep: 5 (Value: 17)\n- Brick: 18 (Value: 30)\n- Ore: 11 (Value: 34)\n\nPlayer 1's last offer was: 3 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick.\nLet's evaluate this offer from Player 1:\n- Offered value: (3 Sheep * 17) + (1 Wood * 11) = 51 + 11 = 62\n- Requested value: (2 Brick * 30) = 60\nPlayer 1 is offering 62 value for 60 value. This offer is slightly in your favor, but you're low on Sheep, which is a valuable resource.\nA key strategy is to get more of the high-value items (Ore, Brick). You might want to hold onto Sheep and Wood.\n\nConsider your current resources and past interactions. You have been trying to acquire Brick. This offer gives you Brick for Sheep and Wood.\n\nIf you accept:\n- Sheep: 5 - 3 = 2\n- Wood: 17 - 1 = 16\n- Brick: 18 + 2 = 20\n\nYour previous offers for Brick were 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick. This offer is 3 Sheep, 1 Wood for 2 Brick. This is effectively 1.5 Sheep + 0.5 Wood for 1 Brick, which is a worse rate for you than your previous offer of 2 Sheep for 1 Brick (you are effectively paying more for Brick).\n\nHowever, you have failed to get any Brick in the previous rounds by offering Sheep. This offer from Player 1 finally proposes something where you gain Brick.\n\nYou have 5 Sheep, so giving up 3 would leave you with 2. This makes Sheep a very scarce resource for you.\n\nGiven your goal of increasing total value, you want to acquire items with a high value. Brick has a high value.\n\nIt's a tough decision. On one hand, you want Brick. On the other hand, the offer is not ideal for you when you look at it from your desired ratio. Let's see if you can counter-offer something better. But you don't have much time left (only 10 turns total, and you are already in turn 7).\n\nLet's try to make a counter offer that is better for you.\nYou want Brick. You have a lot of Wheat and some Wood that are lower value.\nWhat if you offer a combination of lower value items for Brick?\n\nFor example, 4 Wheat + 1 Wood for 1 Brick.\nValue offered: (4 * 5) + (1 * 11) = 20 + 11 = 31\nValue requested: 1 * 30 = 30\nThis is a good offer for you.\n\nLet's look at Player 1's last offer again: 3 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick.\nValue offered by P1: 62. Value requested by P1: 60. You benefit by 2.\nThis is not a bad offer in terms of total value, but it gives away scarce and high-value Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get Brick using your abundant Wheat.\nYou tried 2 Sheep for 1 Brick multiple times, and they denied.\n\nPerhaps you can attempt to get more Brick for fewer Sheep.\nWhat if you offer 1 Sheep and some Wheat for 1 Brick?\n1 Sheep (17) for 1 Brick (30) is bad for them.\n\nLet's consider if you should accept this offer.\n- You gain 2 Brick (value 60).\n- You lose 3 Sheep (value 51) and 1 Wood (value 11).\nNet change in value for you: 60 - 51 - 11 = -2. Oh, wait, the total value for Player 1's offer is **62** for what you \"give\" and you \"receive\" **60**. This means you are losing value!\nMy previous calculation was incorrect. Player 1 is requesting **you** to give 3 Sheep and 1 Wood (total value 62) and offering **you** 2 Brick (total value 60). This means the offer is **not** in your favor; it makes your wealth slightly decrease.\n\nYou should reject this offer.\n\nNow, what to offer? You need Brick.\nYou have plenty of Wheat and Wood. The previous offers for Sheep -> Brick were denied.\nLet's try a different combination.\n\nWhat if you offer a mix? Say, 1 Wood + 7 Wheat for 1 Brick?\nValue offered: (1 * 11) + (7 * 5) = 11 + 35 = 46.\nValue requested: 1 * 30 = 30.\nThis is even worse for you than the current offer!\n\nYou need to find an offer where you gain value, or at least break even, while getting Brick.\nYou have 18 Brick already. You have 11 Ore already. These are high-value.\nYou have 22 Wheat and 17 Wood. These are low-value.\n\nYour previous offers were 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick. Value: 34 -> 30. This was a loss for you.\nIt seems like you've been consistently offering to lose value to get Brick.\nYou have 5 Sheep. If you give 2, you have 3. If you give 3 (as in P1's offer), you have 2.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, since it's the highest value. But P1 has been asking for Brick for something.\n\nLet's re-evaluate what you want. You want to increase total value.\nSo far, you haven't succeeded in making a trade.\n\nWhat if you offer something that looks good for Player 1, but is still profitable for you?\nYour available items and their ratios (current/target for Brick (30)):\n- Wood (11): Need ~3 Wood for 1 Brick. You have 17.\n- Sheep (17): Need ~2 Sheep for 1 Brick. You have 5.\n- Wheat (5): Need ~6 Wheat for 1 Brick. You have 22.\n\nP1 is offering 3 Sheep, 1 Wood for 2 Brick. (You give 62, get 60. Lose 2).\nYou should always ensure you gain value.\n\nHow about trying to gain some Ore, too?\nLet's try to offer cheap items for expensive ones.\n\nOffer: 8 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick\nValue of offer: (8 * 5) + (1 * 11) = 40 + 11 = 51.\nValue requested: 1 * 30 = 30.\nThis is a bad offer for you in terms of value.\n\nYou have been trying to get Brick using Sheep. It didn't work.\nLet's try one more time to get Brick, but with a different resource.\n\nWhat about trying to get Ore?\nOffer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore\nValue offered: 1 * 30 = 30\nValue requested: 1 * 34 = 34\nThis is favorable to you. You have a lot of Brick.\n\nLet's try this. You have 18 Brick. Giving 1 away to get a higher value item is a good move.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
