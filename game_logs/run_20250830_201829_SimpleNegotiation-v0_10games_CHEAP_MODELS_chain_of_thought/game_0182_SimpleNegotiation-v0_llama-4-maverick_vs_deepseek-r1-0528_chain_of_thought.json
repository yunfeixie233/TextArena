      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first calculate the total value of the resources I currently have.\n\n1. Wheat: 25 * 5 = 125\n2. Wood: 14 * 12 = 168\n3. Sheep: 6 * 14 = 84\n4. Brick: 19 * 20 = 380\n5. Ore: 20 * 38 = 760\n\nTotal value = 125 + 168 + 84 + 380 + 760 = 1517\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I should look for trades that give me more value than I give away. Let's examine the resources I have and consider what might be a good trade.\n\nGiven the values, Ore is the most valuable resource per unit, followed by Brick. I have a significant quantity of both, but Ore is more valuable per unit. Wood and Sheep are less abundant for me, and Wheat is the least valuable per unit.\n\nLet's consider making an initial offer that could potentially increase my total value. Since I have a lot of Ore and Brick, I'm looking to trade these for other resources that could either be more valuable or complement my existing resources.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of my less valuable resources (in terms of total value or quantity) for something that could either be used to gain more value or directly increase my total value.\n\nAn initial offer could be:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis offer gives away: (5 * 5) + (2 * 12) = 25 + 24 = 49\nFor: 1 * 38 = 38\n\nThis doesn't seem like a good trade for me since I'm getting less value than I'm giving away.\n\nLet's consider another option:\n'[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis offer gives away: 2 * 20 = 40\nFor: 1 * 38 = 38\n\nStill not beneficial.\n\nLet's think about trading some of my Wheat (the least valuable resource per unit) for something more valuable:\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\nThis offer gives away: 10 * 5 = 50\nFor: 1 * 20 = 20\n\nThis is not a good trade.\n\nConsidering my resources again, let's directly form a trade offer that might appeal to the other player while slightly benefiting me or at least not harming my total value significantly. Since my total value is quite distributed but heavily weighted towards Ore and Brick, I'll think about what the other player might have and want.\n\nTurn 1:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood]'\n\nThis gives away: (5 * 5) + (1 * 14) = 25 + 14 = 39\nFor: 2 * 12 = 24\n\nThis isn't a great trade for me, but let's make it to see the response.\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood]'",

However, it was an attempt to gain Ore.\n\n4. **Decision:**\n   Given that the offer from Player 1 is not beneficial and was made in response to Player 0's initial offer, let's reassess what could be a good trade.\n\n   - Player 0 has a lot of Wheat and Brick but relatively fewer Sheep and Wood compared to other resources.\n   - Ore is very valuable, and gaining more Ore would increase the total value.\n\n   A potential strategy is to think about what resources Player 0 can afford to lose and what would be a fair trade to gain something more valuable.\n\n5. **Counter Offer:**\n   Let's consider making a counteroffer. One possibility is to adjust the initial offer to make it more appealing or to propose a different trade.\n\n   For example, offering fewer resources for 1 Ore or proposing a different set of resources. \n\n   Considering the values, a potential counteroffer could be:\n   - Reducing the amount of Wheat and/or Wood offered for 1 Ore.\n\n   Let's adjust the initial offer. Instead of offering 5 Wheat and 2 Wood for 1 Ore, a more balanced offer could be:\n   - **[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]**\n     - Offered: 4 Wheat (Value: 20), 1 Wood (Value: 12) = 32\n     - Requested: 1 Ore (Value: 38)\n\n   This offer is more reasonable and results in a gain of 6 in value.\n\n   **[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]**",

      "response": "Since I've already accepted a trade offer from Player 1 in the previous turn and made the necessary exchange (3 Wheat, 1 Brick for 1 Ore), my current resources have changed. Let's first update my resources based on the last accepted trade.\n\nInitially, I had:\n- Wheat: 25\n- Wood: 14\n- Sheep: 6\n- Brick: 19\n- Ore: 20\n\nAfter the trade (3 Wheat, 1 Brick for 1 Ore):\n- Wheat: 25 - 3 = 22\n- Wood: 14 (no change)\n- Sheep: 6 (no change)\n- Brick: 19 - 1 = 18\n- Ore: 20 + 1 = 21\n\nNow, let's evaluate the new offer from Player 1: Offered items: 1 Ore -> Requested items: 2 Wheat, 2 Brick.\n\nTo assess this offer, we need to compare the value of what is being offered and requested.\n- 1 Ore = 38 value\n- 2 Wheat = 2 * 5 = 10 value\n- 2 Brick = 2 * 20 = 40 value\n\nTotal value of requested resources = 10 + 40 = 50 value.\n\nSince 38 (value of 1 Ore) is less than 50 (total value of 2 Wheat and 2 Brick), accepting this offer would decrease my total resource value.\n\nGiven that my goal is to increase the total value of my resources, I should reject this offer.\n\nMy action: [Deny]\n\nThe current status of my resources:\n- Wheat: 22\n- Wood: 14\n- Sheep: 6\n- Brick: 18\n- Ore: 21\n\nLet's prepare for the next turn. Considering the values, I should think about making a new offer that could potentially increase my resource value.\n\nMy next action: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Ore]\n\nThis offer is based on the idea of giving away less valuable resources to gain more valuable ones. The value of 2 Sheep and 1 Wood is (2*14) + (1*12) = 28 + 12 = 40. In return, I'm asking for 2 Ore, which is worth 2*38 = 76. This could be a beneficial trade if accepted.\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds.\n\nAction: `[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Ore]`",
