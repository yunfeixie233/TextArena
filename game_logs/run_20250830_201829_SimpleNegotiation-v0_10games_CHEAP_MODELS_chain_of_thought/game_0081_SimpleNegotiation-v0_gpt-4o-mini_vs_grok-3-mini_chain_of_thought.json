      "response": "Let's first summarize the current situation with your resources after the trades:\n\n1. **Initial Resources**:\n   - Wheat: 24 (Value: 5)\n   - Wood: 25 (Value: 12)\n   - Sheep: 7 (Value: 14)\n   - Brick: 10 (Value: 22)\n   - Ore: 5 (Value: 33)\n\n2. **After Trades**:\n   - Accepted trade from Player 1: You traded 5 Wheat and 2 Sheep for 2 Ore.\n   - Accepted trade from Player 1: You traded 2 Brick for 2 Ore.\n   - Traded 4 Brick for 2 Ore.\n\n**Current Resources Summary**:\n- Wheat: 19 (after giving away 5)\n- Wood: 25 (unchanged)\n- Sheep: 5 (after giving away 2)\n- Brick: 6 (after giving away 4)\n- Ore: 9 (after receiving 2 ore from trades)\n\nValue breakdown:\n- Wheat: 19 * 5 = 95\n- Wood: 25 * 12 = 300\n- Sheep: 5 * 14 = 70\n- Brick: 6 * 22 = 132\n- Ore: 9 * 33 = 297\n\n**Total Value of Resources** = 95 + 300 + 70 + 132 + 297 = 894\n\nNext, let's focus on the new trade offer from Player 1:\n\n**Player 1's Offer**: Offered items: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n\n**Decision**: \nYou currently have 9 Ore, and accepting this offer will decrease your Wheat by 3 and Wood by 1. Let's consider the value change:\n\n- If you accept:\n   - Wheat: 19 - 3 = 16\n   - Wood: 25 - 1 = 24\n   - Ore: 9 + 1 = 10\n\nAfter trade:\n- Wheat value: 16 * 5 = 80\n- Wood value: 24 * 12 = 288\n- Sheep value: 5 * 14 = 70\n- Brick value: 6 * 22 = 132\n- Ore value: 10 * 33 = 330\n\n**New Total Value of Resources** = 80 + 288 + 70 + 132 + 330 = 900\n\nSince accepting the trade increases your total resources' value, it\u2019s beneficial for you.\n\n**Next Action**:\n[Accept]",
