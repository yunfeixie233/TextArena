      "response": "I will make another trade offer to Player 1. My goal is to maximize the value of my resources.\n\nLooking at my current resources:\n*   Wheat: 20 (Value 5) = 100\n*   Wood: 17 (Value 8) = 136\n*   Sheep: 9 (Value 18) = 162\n*   Brick: 7 (Value 25) = 175\n*   Ore: 10 (Value 32) = 320\n\nTotal value = 100 + 136 + 162 + 175 + 320 = 893\n\nMy previous offer was 5 Wheat (Value 25), 3 Wood (Value 24) -> 2 Ore (Value 64). This was a good offer for me. Player 1 rejected it, likely because the value was too skewed for them or they didn't need the Wheat/Wood.\n\nI want to try and get more high-value resources like Ore or Brick, by offering lower-value resources. I have a good amount of Wheat and Wood. Player 1 likely needs some of the resources I have a surplus of, or finds more utility in them than I do.\n\nLet's try to offer a more balanced trade from Player 1's perspective, while still being beneficial for me.\n\nMy resources are:\n[Wheat] Qty: 20 Value: 5\n[Wood] Qty: 17 Value: 8\n[Sheep] Qty: 9 Value: 18\n[Brick] Qty: 7 Value: 25\n[Ore] Qty: 10 Value: 32\n\nConsider offering Sheep and Wood for Brick.\nValue of 2 Sheep = 2 * 18 = 36\nValue of 3 Wood = 3 * 8 = 24\nTotal offered value = 60\n\nValue of 3 Brick = 3 * 25 = 75\n\nThis is still good for me. Let's make it a bit more enticing for Player 1.\nWhat if I offer 2 Sheep and 5 Wood for 3 Brick?\nOffered: 2 Sheep (36), 5 Wood (40) = 76\nRequested: 3 Brick (75)\nThis is almost even, but I'm trading lower value items for a higher value item, so it's a good trade if Player 1 needs Wood/Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again.\nWhat about offering some Brick for Ore? I have 7 Brick, and they are valuable.\nMaybe I can get 1 Ore for 1 Brick and some Wheat.\nValue of 1 Brick = 25\nValue of 3 Wheat = 15\nTotal offered = 40 (1 Brick, 3 Wheat)\nRequested = 1 Ore (32)\nThis is not good for me.\n\nLet's rethink my strategy. Player 1 rejected an offer where I was gaining 15 value.\nMaybe Player 1 has a lot of Ore and wants to get rid of it. Or they need Sheep or Brick.\n\nI'll try to offer a slightly more generous deal from my lower-value resources for a higher-value resource, like Ore rather than Brick.\n\nLet's try offering: Some Wheat, some Wood, some Sheep -> Some Ore.\nIf I offer 10 Wheat (Value 50) and 5 Wood (Value 40) = 90\nWhat can I request? 2 Ore (Value 64). Still a good gain for me.\nWhat about 3 Ore (Value 96)? Closer to even, but I get a higher-value resource.\n\nLet's stick with my plan to get a higher value resource.\nI have a lot of Wheat and a good amount of Wood.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Ore]",
