      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\n#### Current Resources:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 9    Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 18   Value: 9\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 11   Value: 17\n- [Brick]   Qty: 11   Value: 29\n- [Ore]     Qty: 11   Value: 33\n\n#### Previous Offers and Responses:\n1. Player 0 offered: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore\n   - Player 1 rejected.\n2. Player 0 offered: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Sheep, 1 Ore\n   - Player 1 rejected.\n\n#### Analysis:\n- The total value of the current resources is calculated as follows:\n  - Wheat: 9 * 5 = 45\n  - Wood: 18 * 9 = 162\n  - Sheep: 11 * 17 = 187\n  - Brick: 11 * 29 = 319\n  - Ore: 11 * 33 = 363\n  - Total Value = 45 + 162 + 187 + 319 + 363 = 1076\n  \n- The previous offers indicate that Player 0 is trying to get higher-value resources (like Brick, Sheep, and Ore) in exchange for lower-value resources (Wheat and Wood).\n- Player 1 has rejected both offers, suggesting that the terms were not favorable for them.\n\n#### Strategy for Next Turn:\n1. **Re-evaluate the Offered and Requested Resources:**\n   - The first offer (5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore) was rejected. The total value given away is (5*5) + (5*9) = 25 + 45 = 70, and the total value received is (2*29) + (1*33) = 58 + 33 = 91. The net gain is +21.\n   - The second offer (4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Sheep, 1 Ore) was also rejected. The total value given away is (4*5) + (3*9) = 20 + 27 = 47, and the total value received is (2*17) + (1*33) = 34 + 33 = 67. The net gain is +20.\n\n2. **Formulate a New Offer:**\n   - Both previous offers resulted in a positive net gain in value. However, they were rejected by Player 1, indicating that Player 1 might not have found the offers beneficial or might not have had the requested resources.\n   - Consider making an offer that still aims to exchange lower-value resources for higher-value ones but adjusts the quantities or types to be more appealing or feasible for Player 1.\n\n3. **Proposed Offer:**\n   - Let's analyze the resources again and consider an offer that gives away resources of lower value for those of higher value.\n   - An example could be: Offering 3 Wheat, 4 Wood for 1 Brick, 1 Ore. \n     - Value given away: (3*5) + (4*9) = 15 + 36 = 51\n     - Value received: (1*29) + (1*33) = 29 + 33 = 62\n     - Net gain: +11\n   - Although the net gain is positive, it's less than the previous offers. We need to consider if Player 1 is more likely to accept this.\n\n### Action:\nGiven the analysis, the next step is to make a new trade offer. Let's propose: \n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]\n\n### Response:\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]`",

      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAfter accepting the trade offer from Player 1, let's analyze the current state of resources for Player 0.\n\n#### Initial Resources for Player 0:\n- Wheat: 9, Value: 5\n- Wood: 18, Value: 9\n- Sheep: 11, Value: 17\n- Brick: 11, Value: 29\n- Ore: 11, Value: 33\n\n#### Resources After the Last Trade:\n- Player 0 offered: None (accepted an offer)\n- Player 0 received: 3 Brick, 2 Ore\n- Player 0 gave: 7 Sheep, 5 Wood\n\n#### New Quantity and Total Value:\n1. **Wheat**: 9 (no change)\n   - Total Value = 9 * 5 = 45\n2. **Wood**: 18 - 5 = 13\n   - Total Value = 13 * 9 = 117\n3. **Sheep**: 11 - 7 = 4\n   - Total Value = 4 * 17 = 68\n4. **Brick**: 11 + 3 = 14\n   - Total Value = 14 * 29 = 406\n5. **Ore**: 11 + 2 = 13\n   - Total Value = 13 * 33 = 429\n\n#### Total Value Before Trade: \n- (9*5) + (18*9) + (11*17) + (11*29) + (11*33) = 45 + 162 + 187 + 319 + 363 = 1076\n\n#### Total Value After Trade:\n- (9*5) + (13*9) + (4*17) + (14*29) + (13*33) = 45 + 117 + 68 + 406 + 429 = 1065\n\n### Decision for Next Turn\n\nThe total value of resources decreased slightly from 1076 to 1065 after the last trade. \n\nTo improve the total value, we need to make a strategic offer. Let's analyze the resources and their values:\n\n1. We have a relatively low quantity of Sheep now (4), which is not very valuable compared to other resources.\n2. We have a good amount of Brick (14) and Ore (13), which are high-value resources.\n\nConsidering the values and quantities, a potential trade could involve offering some of our less valuable resources or those in surplus relative to their value, in exchange for resources that are either more valuable or could potentially be used to get more valuable resources.\n\n### Potential Trade Offer\n\nLet's consider making an offer that involves giving away some Wheat (low quantity and value) and possibly some Wood (we have 13, which is a moderate quantity), in exchange for more valuable resources like Ore or Brick.\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nGiven the current state and the need to increase the total value, let's propose a trade offer.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer aims to exchange resources of lower total value (4 Wheat = 20, 4 Wood = 36, Total = 56) for resources of higher total value (1 Brick = 29, 1 Ore = 33, Total = 62), potentially increasing our total resource value.\n\n### Action in Required Format\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]",
