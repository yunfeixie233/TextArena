Trading 10 Sheep (which cost me 120 in value) for 4 Ore (gaining 140 in value) results in a net gain of 20 value, optimizing my holdings.

Instead, I'm proposing a new trade: I'll give you Wood, which is versatile and useful, in exchange for Ore. Specifically, I'm offering 5 Wood for 2 Ore. This gives you a solid resource for building or trading, while helping me balance my stock. What do you think?\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
