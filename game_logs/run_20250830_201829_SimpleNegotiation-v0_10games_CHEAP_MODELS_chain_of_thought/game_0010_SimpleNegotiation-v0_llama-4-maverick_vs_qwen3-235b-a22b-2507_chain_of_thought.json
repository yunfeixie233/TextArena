      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to strategize my trades effectively. Let's first calculate the total value of my current resources.\n\n1. Wheat: 18 * 5 = 90\n2. Wood: 7 * 12 = 84\n3. Sheep: 5 * 13 = 65\n4. Brick: 23 * 25 = 575\n5. Ore: 13 * 32 = 416\n\nTotal value = 90 + 84 + 65 + 575 + 416 = 1230\n\nAt the start, I have a good distribution of resources but need to think about what my opponent might have and what they might be looking for. Since I have a significant amount of Brick and Ore, which are high in value, I should look to trade some of these for other resources that might be underrepresented in my inventory or for resources that I have in abundance but are of lower value, potentially getting a better deal.\n\nLet's start by thinking about what I can offer. I have a lot of Brick (23), so giving away some Brick might be a good start if I can get something valuable in return. Similarly, I have a fair amount of Ore (13), so Ore could also be a bargaining chip.\n\nFor my first move, I will propose a trade that involves giving away some Brick, as it's one of my most abundant resources relative to its value compared to others like Ore. Let's say I offer 3 Brick for something that is either abundant or less valuable to me but potentially valuable to them.\n\nGiven the options and my resources, a reasonable trade could involve offering Brick in exchange for something else. However, without knowing the opponent's resources, I'll start by making an offer that could be generally appealing.\n\nI will propose: '[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]' is not a good idea since Ore is valuable to me. Instead, let's think about offering something less valuable for something more or equally valuable. \n\nLet's start with: '[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep]'.\n\nThis trade aims to get more Sheep (Value: 13) by giving away resources worth (2*5 + 1*12 = 22). This is not a very favorable trade for me in terms of immediate value (I get 13 worth of Sheep for 22 worth of resources), so let's reconsider.\n\nA potentially better strategy is to directly look for a trade that increases my total value. Let's directly analyze a more straightforward offer.\n\nSince I have plenty of Brick and Wheat, let's think about getting rid of some Wheat (least valuable resource per unit) and getting something more valuable.\n\nLet's make a more straightforward offer: '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood]'. This trade involves giving away 5 Wheat (5*5 = 25 value) to get 1 Wood (1*12 = 12 value), which doesn't seem advantageous.\n\nRevisiting my initial thought, if I can get more Ore or Sheep (higher value), it might be worth considering. \n\nFor Turn 1, I will make an offer that could be reasonable: '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'. Here, I'm giving away 4 Wheat (value: 20) to gain 1 Ore (value: 32), which is a gain of 12 in total value.\n\nSo, my action for Turn 1 is: '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'",

However, we should also be cautious and strategic about our next offer.\n\nCurrent state:\n+ [Wheat] Qty:18 Value:5\n+ [Wood] Qty:7 Value:12\n+ [Sheep] Qty:5 Value:13\n+ [Brick] Qty:28 Value:25\n+ [Ore] Qty:10 Value:32\n\nLet's make a new offer. We can try to get more resources that are valuable. One potential trade could involve offering some of our less valuable resources for something more valuable.\n\nFor instance, we could offer some Wheat (Value:5) for something more valuable like Ore (Value:32) or Sheep (Value:13).\n\nLet's propose: [Offer:2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]\n\nThis is a reasonable starting point because we're offering something of relatively low value for something more valuable.\n\n## Step 1: Determine the action.\nThe action is to make a trade offer.\n\n## Step 2: Decide on the resources to offer and request.\nWe will offer 2 Wheat and request 1 Sheep.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate the trade offer using the special tokens.\n[Offer:2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer:2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]}$",
