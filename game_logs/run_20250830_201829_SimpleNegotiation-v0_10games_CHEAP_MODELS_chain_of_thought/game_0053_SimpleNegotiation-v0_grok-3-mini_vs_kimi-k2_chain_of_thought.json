Trading away even 1 Ore for 5 Wheat would reduce my Ore count further, potentially making it harder to leverage Ore for higher-value trades later.\n   - Although the immediate value increases, Ore's scarcity makes it more valuable in future turns. Holding Ore might allow me to get better deals (e.g., trading Ore for multiple higher-value items later).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The trade is fair in terms of immediate value (+14), but the strategic value of Ore (high scarcity and importance for future trades) outweighs the immediate gain. Therefore, rejecting the trade is the better long-term decision.\n\nAction: [Deny]",
