      "response": "After reviewing the trade history and my current resource valuation, I see that Ore remains highly valuable (39 per unit) while Wood is less valuable (10 per unit). My previous offers of 2 Sheep for 1 Ore were successful once but recently rejected, indicating Player 1 may be less willing to part with Ore now. To adapt, I'll propose a new trade that leverages my surplus Wood while minimizing Sheep usage. Offering 1 Sheep and 2 Wood for 1 Ore maintains a slight net gain for me (38 value given vs. 39 received) while being more appealing than pure Sheep offers. This conserves Sheep for other opportunities and uses abundant Wood.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
