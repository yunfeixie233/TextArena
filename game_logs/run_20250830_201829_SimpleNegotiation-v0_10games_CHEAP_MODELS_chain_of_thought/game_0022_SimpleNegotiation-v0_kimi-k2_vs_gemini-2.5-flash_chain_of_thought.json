      "response": "Alright, let's analyze the situation and plan my next move.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- **Turns Left**: Since the game lasts 10 turns and we've had some back and forth, let's assume we're at turn 5 or 6 (based on the sequence provided). I'll proceed carefully with the remaining turns.\n- **Current Resources & Values**:\n  - Wheat: 10 (Value: 6)\n  - Wood: 15 (Value: 12)\n  - Sheep: 22 (Value: 16)\n  - Brick: 17 (Value: 29) - This seems high compared to others, so Brick is valuable.\n  - Ore: 20 (Value: 36) - Highest value, so expensive to give away.\n\n### Previous Offers:\n- **Offer 1**: 2 Ore for 4 Brick (rejected)\n- **Offer 2**: 8 Ore for 12 Brick (rejected)\n\nBoth offers were Ore for Brick, with increasing amounts. The rejections suggest Player 1 values Brick highly (or doesn't value Ore enough). Maybe the ratio is off, or Player 1 doesn't want to part with Brick.\n\n### Strategy:\nPlayer 1 seems unwilling to trade Brick for Ore. Maybe they need Brick more, or they see Ore as overvalued. Since Brick is already my second-highest valued resource (after Ore), perhaps I should shift focus to other resources. Alternatively, I might need to offer more Ore for Brick (though previous ratios were already steep).\n\nAlternatively, Player 1 might be hoarding Brick for their own strategy. Maybe offering different resources or exploring what Player 1 lacks/currently has could help.\n\n### Next Move:\nSince pure Ore-for-Brick isn't working, I'll explore trading something else. Maybe Sheep (I have a surplus: 22) or Wood (15). Let's see if Player 1 wants less valuable resources for Brick.\n\nI'll offer Sheep for Brick at a rate Player 1 might find attractive. \n\n[Offer: 6 Sheep -> 4 Brick]",

I still hold 20 Ore. That\u2019s more than I need, and each Ore is worth 9 value points to me (greater than any other resource).\n2. Player 1 values Brick very highly; any request for Brick must be made generous.\n\nA concession: 3 Ore for 3 Brick is a \u201c1:1\u201d ratio; I gain 9\u20133\u00d7(9-29/3)\u22482 absolute value, but for Player 1 this is still 3 of the most desirable ore for only 3 brick, which may appear less attractive since Brick > Ore to them.\n\nAlternative: give them more Mid-value resources they might accept.  \nSheep are worth only 16 each to me but are abundant (22 units). So maybe Offer 6 Sheep + 1 Ore \u2192 5 Brick.\n\nQuick math on that:  \nI lose (6\u00d716)+(1\u00d79)=105 value, gain (5\u00d729)=145 value \u2192 net +40 value.  \nPlayer 1 gains 105 - 5\u00d729 = 105 - 145 = \u201340, which is too steep on their side; rejection likely.\n\nMore balanced option: 5 Sheep + 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick  \nI lose 5\u00d716 + 2\u00d79 = 80 + 18 = 98  \nI gain 5\u00d729 = 145  \u2192 +47 value.  \nThey still give up 145 value of Brick to gain only 98 value, so same problem.\n\nConclusion: To actually secure Brick from someone protecting it, I probably have to pay the premium in Ore directly but still sweeten.\n\nOffer I will make now, turn 7\nGive 2 Ore and 1 Sheep for 2 Brick.\n\nValue split:  \n- Me: out 2\u00d79 + 1\u00d716 = 34, in 2\u00d729 = 58.

A fair Brick-to-Sheep ratio is about 1.8 : 1 in my favor, so I\u2019d like at least 1 Brick for every 1 Sheep given, or ideally a better deal.  \n\u2022 Player 1 seems to value Brick highly. If I counter-offer at 1 Brick = 1 Sheep, the trade is slightly favorable to me (1.8 vs 2.0), but still acceptable. It also keeps the dialogue alive and shows flexibility.\n\nNew offer  \n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 2 Sheep]",
