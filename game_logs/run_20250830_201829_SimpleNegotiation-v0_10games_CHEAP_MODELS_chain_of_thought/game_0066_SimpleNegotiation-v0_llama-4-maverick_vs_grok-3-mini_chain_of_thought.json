Brick and Sheep are also valuable.\n   - We can consider giving away Wheat and Wood as they are of lower value.\n\n5. **First Turn Action:**\n   - Let's start by making an offer that tries to exchange lower-value resources for higher-value ones. We have a considerable amount of Wheat, so let's try to get rid of some Wheat for something more valuable.\n\nConsidering the values:\n- Let's offer 10 Wheat for 1 Ore, as Ore is very valuable and we have a lot of Wheat.\n\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis is our first offer.

      "response": "Since the task is to follow the required format and make a decision based on the Negotiation Game, I will analyze the given situation and respond accordingly.\n\n## Step 1: Review Current Resources and Values\nThe current resources and their values are:\n- Wheat: 20 - 10 (given to Player1) - 4 (offered but rejected) + 5 (received from Player1) - 4 (offered but rejected) - 3 (offered but rejected) + 5 (offered by Player1) = 20 - 10 - 4 + 5 - 4 - 3 + 5 = 9, Value: 5\n- Wood: 11, Value: 8\n- Sheep: 11 - 2 (traded to Player1) = 9, Value: 15\n- Brick: 7 + 1 (received from Player1) + 1 (received from Player1) = 9, Value: 21\n- Ore: 11 + 1 (received from Player1) = 12, Value: 32\n\nLet's correct the calculation based on the transactions:\n- Initially, Wheat = 20, \n- After giving 10 Wheat to Player1: Wheat = 20 - 10 = 10\n- Then, received 5 Wheat: Wheat = 10 + 5 = 15\n- Offered 4 Wheat: Wheat = 15 - 4 = 11\n- Player1 offered 4 Wheat, then 5 Wheat, and it was accepted: Wheat = 11 + 5 = 16\n- Offered 3 Wheat: Wheat = 16 - 3 = 13\n- So, Wheat = 13\n- Wood = 11\n- Sheep = 11 - 2 = 9\n- Brick = 7 + 1 + 1 = 9\n- Ore = 11 + 1 = 12\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Current Total Value\nLet's calculate the total value of the current resources:\n- Wheat (13): 13 * 5 = 65\n- Wood (11): 11 * 8 = 88\n- Sheep (9): 9 * 15 = 135\n- Brick (9): 9 * 21 = 189\n- Ore (12): 12 * 32 = 384\nTotal Value = 65 + 88 + 135 + 189 + 384 = 861\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the Last Offer from Player1\nPlayer1 made an offer: [Offered items:5 Wheat -> Requested items:1 Ore]\nThis means Player1 is offering 5 Wheat in exchange for 1 Ore.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the Offer\nTo evaluate if the offer is beneficial:\n- Giving 1 Ore (Value: 32) \n- Receiving 5 Wheat (Value: 5 * 5 = 25)\nSince 32 > 25, accepting this offer would decrease the total value of resources.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on the Offer\nGiven that accepting the offer would result in a loss of value (32 for 25), it's not beneficial. Thus, the offer should be denied.\n\n## Step 6: Consider Making a New Offer\nSince it's the last turn or near the end, we should consider if there's a beneficial trade. However, the task now is to respond to the given situation.\n\n## Step 7: Respond According to the Game Rules\nFor the offer [Offered items:5 Wheat -> Requested items:1 Ore] from Player1, the response should be '[Deny]' since it's not beneficial.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Deny]}$",
