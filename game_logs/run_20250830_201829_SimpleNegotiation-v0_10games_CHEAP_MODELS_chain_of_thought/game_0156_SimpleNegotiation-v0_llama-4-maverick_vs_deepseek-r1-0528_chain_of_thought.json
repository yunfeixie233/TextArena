      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to analyze what I have and what might be beneficial to trade for. Let's first calculate the total value of my current resources.\n\n1. Wheat: 25 * 5 = 125\n2. Wood: 7 * 12 = 84\n3. Sheep: 20 * 17 = 340\n4. Brick: 24 * 25 = 600\n5. Ore: 24 * 35 = 840\n\nTotal value = 125 + 84 + 340 + 600 + 840 = 1989\n\nMy resources are valued at 1989. To increase this value, I need to make trades that either increase the quantity of higher-value resources or exchange lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\nSince the values of the resources are given, we can see that Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat. A good strategy would be to try to get more Ore or Brick if possible, or at least not trade away the resources with higher values.\n\nLet's start by making an initial offer. I notice that I have a significant quantity of Brick and Ore, which are high-value resources. I should be cautious about trading them away. However, I also have a decent amount of Sheep. I could potentially trade some Sheep, which is of moderate to high value, for other resources if it benefits me.\n\nLet's consider making an offer that involves trading some of my Wheat (the lowest value resource) for Wood (a higher value resource than Wheat but lower than the others). \n\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 5 Wood]'\n\nThis is a reasonable starting offer as it doesn't risk losing high-value resources.\n\nResponse: '[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 5 Wood]'",

I offered 10 Wheat -> 5 Wood (Accepted)\n   - Wheat: 25 - 10 = 15\n   - Wood: 7 + 5 = 12\n\n2. I offered 8 Wheat -> 4 Sheep (Rejected)\n   - No change\n\n3. I offered 5 Sheep -> 3 Wood (Accepted)\n   - Sheep: 20 - 5 = 15\n   - Wood: 12 + 3 = 15\n\nCurrent state:\n- Wheat: 15\n- Wood: 15\n- Sheep: 15\n- Brick: 24\n- Ore: 24\n\nThe current total value is:\n- Wheat: 15 * 5 = 75\n- Wood: 15 * 12 = 180\n- Sheep: 15 * 17 = 255\n- Brick: 24 * 25 = 600\n- Ore: 24 * 35 = 840\nTotal = 75 + 180 + 255 + 600 + 840 = 1950\n\nNow, let's evaluate the last offer made by Player 1: Offered items: 3 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n\nIf I accept this offer:\n- Wood: 15 + 3 = 18\n- Ore: 24 - 1 = 23\n\nNew total value:\n- Wheat: 15 * 5 = 75\n- Wood: 18 * 12 = 216\n- Sheep: 15 * 17 = 255\n- Brick: 24 * 25 = 600\n- Ore: 23 * 35 = 805\nTotal = 75 + 216 + 255 + 600 + 805 = 1951\n\nThe total value increases by 1. Considering the relatively small gain and the current state of resources, I should be cautious and think about the future turns.\n\nHowever, I will accept this offer because it is a slight improvement and we are in the 10th turn, so there is limited opportunity for further trades.\n\nMy action: [Accept]",
