      "response": "### Negotiation Game Strategy for Player0\n\n#### Initial Resources and Values:\n\n+ [Wheat] Qty:6 Value:5\n+ [Wood] Qty:9 Value:12\n+ [Sheep] Qty:25 Value:13\n+ [Brick] Qty:9 Value:28\n+ [Ore] Qty:7 Value:38\n\n#### Game Plan:\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources through strategic trades over 10 turns. To achieve this, we need to identify which resources are likely to be less valuable to us and more valuable to our opponent, and vice versa.\n\n#### Initial Assessment:\n1. **Total Initial Value**: Calculate the total value of resources.\n   - Wheat: 6 * 5 = 30\n   - Wood: 9 * 12 = 108\n   - Sheep: 25 * 13 = 325\n   - Brick: 9 * 28 = 252\n   - Ore: 7 * 38 = 266\n   - **Total**: 30 + 108 + 325 + 252 + 266 = 981\n\n2. **Prioritizing Trades**: We should look to trade resources that are less valuable or abundant for those that are more valuable or scarce.\n\n#### First Turn Strategy:\nTo initiate a trade, we should consider what we have in abundance and what we lack. We have a significant quantity of Sheep, which, while valuable, might be used to negotiate for resources that are either more valuable or scarcer.\n\nLet's observe the opponent's first move and react accordingly. If they make an offer, we'll assess it based on the value exchange.\n\n#### If Opponent Makes an Offer:\n- If it's a reasonable trade (i.e., we gain value or improve our resource diversity), we might consider accepting it.\n- If not, we'll deny it and potentially make a counteroffer.\n\n#### If Opponent Doesn't Make an Offer or We Start:\nSince we have a good quantity of Sheep and a decent amount of other resources, we might offer something like:\n```\n[Offer:3 Wheat,2 Wood -> 4 Sheep,1 Ore]\n```\nHowever, this is not an optimal starting offer since we have plenty of Sheep. Let's rethink:\n\nA more strategic initial offer could involve trading some of our less valuable resources or those we have in sufficient quantity for something more valuable.\n\nSince I don't have an incoming offer to react to on the first turn, I'll make a trade offer. Let's think...\n\nWe have plenty of Sheep and some Ore, which is quite valuable. Let's consider offering some Wheat (least valuable per unit) and possibly some Brick (valuable but we still have 9) for more Ore or another valuable resource.\n\n#### Proposed First Turn Action:\nLet's make an offer that could potentially increase our value:\n```\n[Offer:2 Wheat,1 Brick -> 2 Ore,1 Wood]\n```\nThis offer gives away relatively less valuable resources for potentially more valuable ones, aiming to increase our total value.\n\nLet's execute the first turn:\n```\n[Offer:2 Wheat,1 Brick -> 2 Ore,1 Wood]\n```\n#### Monitoring and Adjusting:\nWe'll monitor the opponent's response and adjust our strategy accordingly. If they accept, we'll assess the new distribution. If they deny, we'll either make a new offer or react based on their counteroffer.\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response...",

Offered 3 Wheat, 2 Wood for 4 Sheep, 1 Ore (Rejected)\n2. Offered 2 Wood, 3 Sheep for 4 Wheat, 1 Brick (Accepted)\n3. Offered 5 Wheat, 4 Sheep for 2 Ore, 1 Brick (Rejected)\n4. Offered 4 Sheep, 2 Wood for 3 Ore, 1 Brick (Rejected)\nPlayer 1 accepted a trade that involved gaining Wheat and Brick while giving away Wood and Sheep.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a new trade offer based on the current resources and the history of trades.\nConsidering the last accepted trade, Player 1 seems interested in Wood and Sheep if the offer is right. Currently, we have 7 Wood and 22 Sheep. We need to think about what we can offer and what we can request.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the resources to offer and request.\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- We have a surplus of Sheep and a decent amount of Wood.\n- We could offer some Sheep and/or Wood for resources that are valuable (like Ore or Brick).\n\n## Step 6: Propose a new trade.\nConsidering the current quantities and values:\n- Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> Request: 1 Ore, 1 Brick (This is a potential trade as it involves resources we have in surplus and requests valuable resources).\n\n## Step 7: Format the trade offer according to the game's syntax.\nThe proposed trade in the required format is: [Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]\n\n## Step 8: Check if the proposed trade is beneficial.\nCurrent quantities: 10 Wheat, 7 Wood, 22 Sheep, 10 Brick, 7 Ore.\nAfter the proposed trade: 10 Wheat, 4 Wood, 20 Sheep, 11 Brick, 8 Ore.\nCalculate the new total value:\n- 10 Wheat * 5 = 50\n- 4 Wood * 12 = 48\n- 20 Sheep * 13 = 260\n- 11 Brick * 28 = 308\n- 8 Ore * 38 = 304\nNew total value = 50 + 48 + 260 + 308 + 304 = 970\n\n## Step 9: Decide on the action.\nSince 970 is greater than 966, the trade is beneficial.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]}$",

Offering Wheat (low value) or Wood (moderate value) for higher-value resources like Ore or Brick.\n2. Offering Sheep (moderate value) for higher-value resources.\n\n#### Potential Requests:\n1. Requesting Ore or Brick as they have higher values.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate a Trade Offer\n\nLet's formulate a trade offer based on our analysis.\n\nWe have:\n- A surplus of Wheat and Sheep relatively.\n- A moderate amount of Brick and Ore.\n\nWe can offer some Sheep or Wheat for Ore or Brick.\n\nConsidering the values:\n- Offering 4 Sheep (Value: 4*13 = 52) for 1 Ore (Value: 38) is not beneficial.\n- Offering 2 Wheat (Value: 2*5 = 10) and 1 Sheep (Value: 13) for 1 Brick (Value: 28) could be a good trade because we're giving away (10 + 13 = 23) for (28), which is beneficial.\n\nLet's propose: Offered items: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Brick\n\n### Step 5: Output the Trade Offer in the Required Format\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",
