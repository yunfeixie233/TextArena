I'm looking to acquire more Brick, which I value highly for my own needs, and I see you might have resources to trade. In exchange, I'm offering Wheat and Wood, which could be useful to you if you're lacking in those. Specifically, I propose trading my 3 Wheat and 1 Wood for your 1 Brick. This would help balance our inventories in a fair way, and I'm open to discussing alternatives in future turns. What do you think?\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "Given the recent trade where I successfully traded 3 Wheat and 1 Wood for 1 Brick, I made a net value gain of 4 (Brick value 28 minus 3 Wheat at 15 and Wood at 9).

Brick remains attractive (28 per unit), and since the opponent accepted a Wheat-focused offer before, I\u2019ll attempt a similar trade. Offering 5 Wheat for 1 Brick gives:  \n- **Cost to me**: 5 Wheat \u00d7 5 = 25  \n- **Gain**: 1 Brick \u00d7 28 = 28  \n- **Net value increase**: +3  \n\nThis aligns with my strategy to leverage surplus Wheat while targeting Brick.

Although I would gain a little diversity (I still have only 6 Wheat vs. 20 Brick), the loss of absolute value outweighs this. I therefore decline.\n\n[Deny]\n\nNew Offer (for the current negotiation window):\nI am heavy on Sheep (21) and slightly over-supplied on Wood (23). Brick remains my scarcest positional need, and although I also have a lot of Ore (25) it is the highest\u2013valued material, so I prefer not to part with it in quantity. My target is to move Sheep+Wood into Brick while keeping close to parity in value.\n\nI offer:\n\n4 Sheep (4\u00d716 = 64) and 3 Wood (3\u00d711 = 33)  \n\u2192 combined outgoing value \u2248 97\n\nfor\n\n3 Brick (3\u00d726 = 78)\n\nNet value benefit \u2248 +19 to you, \u201319 to me, but you reduce an over-stock of Brick while acquiring useful Sheep for knight upgrades and Wood for roads; I tighten my surplus. Note I am deliberately *not* offering Ore so as to minimize risk to my high-ticket stack.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 3 Brick]",
