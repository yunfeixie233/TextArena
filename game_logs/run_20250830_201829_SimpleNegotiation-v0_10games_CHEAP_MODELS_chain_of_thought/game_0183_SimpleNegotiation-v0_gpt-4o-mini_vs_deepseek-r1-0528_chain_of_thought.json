Generally, focus on trading surplus resources for those that have higher value.\n\nLet\u2019s create an initial trade offer:\n- Given that you have a lot of Ore and are looking to gain Brick, we will offer a few Ore for some Brick.\n\n### Trade Offer:\n- **Proposed Trade:** Offer 3 Ore for 5 Brick (or something similar to maximize the value).\n\n### My First Move:\nLet's make the initial trade offer:\n\n**[Offer: 3 Ore -> 5 Brick]** \n\nThis trade could potentially increase your resources of Brick, which is a valuable resource, considering its high trade value.
