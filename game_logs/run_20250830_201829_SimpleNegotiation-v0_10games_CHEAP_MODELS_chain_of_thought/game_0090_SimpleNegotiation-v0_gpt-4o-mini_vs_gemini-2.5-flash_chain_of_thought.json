Here\u2019s a summary of my current resources after the trades:\n\n### Resources after trades:\n- **Wheat**: 9 (13 - 4 + 1 = 10; traded 4 Wheat for 3 Ore, 4 Brick, and received 1 Wheat back, then traded 1 Wheat for 2 Ore, 4 Brick \u2192 9)\n- **Wood**: 18 (25 - 5 - 5 + 5 = 20; traded 5 Wood for 2 Ore, 1 Brick and then accepted 5 Wood from Player 1)\n- **Sheep**: 8 (13 - 5 + 5 = 8; traded 5 Sheep and received 5 Wood)\n- **Brick**: 14 (15 + 4 - 1 = 17; gained 4 Brick from Player 1 and then returned 1 back in other trades)\n- **Ore**: 10 (8 - 2 + 4 = 10; gained 2 Ore from trades)\n\n### Current Resources Summary:\n- **Wheat**: 9 Value: 5\n- **Wood**: 20 Value: 12\n- **Sheep**: 8 Value: 17\n- **Brick**: 17 Value: 28\n- **Ore**: 10 Value: 39\n\nNow, I will evaluate potential offers made by Player 1. The last offer from Player 1 was:\n- **Offered**: 5 Wood, 1 Wheat\n- **Requested**: 2 Ore, 4 Brick\n\nPlayer 0's assessment of the current situation:\n1. 2 Ore are valued at 39 each, total value is 78.\n2. 4 Brick are valued at 28 each, total value is 112.\n\nTotal value Player 1 is requesting is (78 + 112 = 190). The offered items are worth significantly less thereby making it a less preferable option. \n\nBased on that, I will offer:\n- **[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 3 Ore, 3 Brick]**\n\nLet's continue the negotiation process.",
