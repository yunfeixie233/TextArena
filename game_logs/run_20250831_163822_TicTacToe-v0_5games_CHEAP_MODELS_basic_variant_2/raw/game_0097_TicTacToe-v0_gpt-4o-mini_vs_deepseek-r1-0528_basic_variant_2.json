This threat must be neutralized immediately.  \n\nBy selecting cell 6 (bottom-left corner), I achieve two critical objectives:  \n1. **Block opponent's winning threat:** Disrupting the 2-4-6 diagonal.  \n2. **Establish strategic influence:** Securing a corner, which controls the left column (cells 0, 3, 6) and the bottom-left to top-right diagonal (cells 6, 4, 2).
