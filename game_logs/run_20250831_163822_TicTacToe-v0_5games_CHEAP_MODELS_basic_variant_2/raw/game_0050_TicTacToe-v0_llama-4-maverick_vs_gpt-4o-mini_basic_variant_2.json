Let's re-evaluate the last known correct state and proceed from there.\n\nThe last known correct state was:\n```\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | 8 \n```\nAvailable Moves: '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n\nLet's continue from this state.\n\n Current Board:\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | 8 \nAvailable Moves: '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n\nAnalyzing the current state, I see that 'X' has been placed in '[3]', altering the board. Given the corrected state, my next move should focus on securing a win or blocking 'X' from winning.\n\nSince 'O' is in the bottom-left corner ('[6]'), and there are 'O's in the middle row, I should consider the available moves to either block 'X' or create a winning line.\n\nMy next move will be to place 'O' in '[8]', aiming to potentially create a diagonal or prepare for a win.\n\nMy move: `[8]`\n\nThis results in the following board state:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | O \n\nLet's await the opponent's response.\n\nPlease provide the updated board state after the opponent's move in the specified format.\n\nFormat: \n Current Board:\n// updated board state\nAvailable Moves: // list of available moves\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] Current Board:\n```\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | 8 \n```\nAvailable Moves: '[7]', '[8]'\n\n Given the current board state, I notice that Player 0 has occupied two 'O's in the second column and one in the bottom row at cell '[6]', creating a strong position. However, I also need to maximize my own chances to win.\n\nChecking the available moves, I see that placing 'X' in cell '[7]' will not create a winning line directly but can add to my presence on the board, while also positioning myself away from a potential 'O' win.\n\nThus, my next move is to occupy cell '[7]'.\n\nMy move: `[7]`\n\nThis results in the following board state:\n\n```\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n O | X | 8 \n```\n\nPlease provide the updated board state after the opponent's move in the specified format.\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n O | X | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[8]'",
