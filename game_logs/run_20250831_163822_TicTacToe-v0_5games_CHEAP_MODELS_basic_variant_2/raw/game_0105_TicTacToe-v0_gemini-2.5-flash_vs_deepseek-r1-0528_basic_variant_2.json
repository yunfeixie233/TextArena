The game log indicates I attempted cell 3, but the board analysis clearly showed **cell 3 was occupied by O** (as seen in the current board). My intended move\u2014**[5]**\u2014was valid but communicated in the reasoning without explicit formatting. This is a strict reminder to never resubmit invalid positions.  \n\n### Current Board Threat Assessment:  \n- **Immediate Loss Risk**:  \n  Player 0 (O) threatens a **game-winning horizontal line** via the middle row (positions 3-4-5). If I do **not** block cell 5, O takes it and wins.  \n\n### Optimal Defensive Action:  \nOccupying **[5]** is **mandatory** to block O's win condition. There is no alternative that prevents defeat.  \n\n### Final Decision:  \n**[5]**\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[6]'\n[Player 0]   Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 6.\n Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | X | O \n\nNo Available Moves.\n Game Over.
