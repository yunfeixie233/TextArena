With O at 1 and 4, Player 0 can threaten victory by claiming cell 7 next turn.  \n   - Player 1 cannot counter both cell 7 (O's threat) and other emerging lines simultaneously.  \n\n**Move Rationale:**  \n- Choosing any other move (e.g., 3, 5, 6, 7) allows Player 1 to win instantly via cell 1.  \n- Claiming cell 1 also disrupts Player 1's momentum and forces them into defense.  \n\n### [MOVE SELECTION]  \n**Chosen Move: Position 1**  \n`[1]`  \n\n**Projected Board After Move:**  \n```\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n```  \n- **Outcome:** Player 1\u2019s top-row threat is neutralized.
