Brick and Ore still command the largest premiums (27 and 36).  \n\nI have 23 Brick but only 24 Ore, so I could safely ship 6 Brick for 3 more Ore (exact 2-for-1 ratio). Net value change for me:  \n+3 \u00d7 36 = +108  \n\u20136 \u00d7 27 = \u2013162 \u2192 \u201354 total value  \n\nI need to sweeten the ratio so Player 0 sees gain too. A 5-for-3 swap is fair on face value (5 \u00d7 27 = 135 vs 3 \u00d7 36 = 108, so Player 0 gains 27 net). That is still negative for me (135 \u2013 108 = \u201327), but Ore is scarcer than Brick in later rounds. I\u2019ll risk it; the liquidity advantage is worth keeping Player 0 engaged and it\u2019s still small enough to not hurt too badly.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 3 Ore]",
