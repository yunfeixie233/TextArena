      "response": "I understand the game instructions. To summarize:\n\n1. My goal is to grow my fortune by trading resources.\n2. My current assets are:\n\t* Wheat: 10 (Value: 6)\n\t* Wood: 25 (Value: 9)\n\t* Sheep: 23 (Value: 12)\n\t* Brick: 17 (Value: 30)\n\t* Ore: 23 (Value: 33)\n3. I will use action tokens to make decisions:\n\t* `[Offer: My_Contribution -> My_Demand]`: Propose a trade.\n\t* `[Accept]`: Accept the current offer.\n\t* `[Deny]`: Reject the current offer (or do nothing to deny).\n\nI'm ready to play. Since it's the first turn and there's no current offer, I will make an initial offer. I'll analyze my resources to decide on a trade.\n\nMy strategy for the first turn is to try to acquire resources that are relatively more valuable. I notice that Ore (Value: 33) is one of the most valuable resources, and I already have some. However, I can try to trade for something else that's valuable or try to get more of a valuable resource if possible.\n\nLet's examine potential trades. I can see that I have a good quantity of Wood (25) and Sheep (23), and their values are relatively lower compared to Brick and Ore. \n\nI'll make an offer to trade 5 Wood (Value: 9) and 4 Sheep (Value: 12) for 2 Brick (Value: 30). The total value I'm offering is (5*9) + (4*12) = 45 + 48 = 93, and the total value I'm demanding is 2*30 = 60. This is not a great trade for me as I'm giving up more value than I'm getting.\n\nLet's adjust the strategy: I'll offer something more balanced.\n\nI'll propose: `[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Brick]`. This is a more balanced start.\n\nMy action for Turn 1: `[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Brick]`.",

The game will last for 10 turns.\n\nI'm ready to play. Since it's the first turn and there's no current offer, I will make an initial offer. I'll propose a trade that could potentially add value to my holdings.\n\nLet's analyze my resources and look for opportunities. I notice that I have a good quantity of Ore (Value: 33), but I also have a significant amount of Wood (Value: 9). Trading some of my less valuable resources for something more valuable could be a good strategy.\n\nMy first offer:\n`[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis trade would give away 5 Wood (Total Value: 45) for 1 Brick (Value: 30), which doesn't seem immediately beneficial. Let me reconsider...\n\nUpon reevaluation, I think a more sensible initial trade would involve offering resources that are less valuable to me in exchange for something of higher or comparable value. Since Brick is quite valuable and I already have a decent amount of it, I'll think about other options.\n\nMy revised first offer:\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Sheep]`\n\nThis trade involves giving away 3 Wheat (Value: 18) and 2 Wood (Value: 18), totaling 36, for 2 Sheep (Value: 24). While it doesn't immediately increase my total value, it's a relatively balanced trade. Let's see how it goes.\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Sheep]`",
