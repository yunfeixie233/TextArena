      "response": "Looking at the current state and past offers, I can see that Player 0 is being quite conservative with their resource management. Let me analyze what might make a more appealing offer.\n\nThe key insight is that I need to make an offer that Player 0 will find beneficial. Given that Player 0 values Ore highly (34 value each) and has Brick as their scarcest resource (only 6 units, value 30), I should focus my efforts there.\n\nLet me calculate different proposals:\n\n**Current Offer Analysis**\n- My last offer: 4 Wheat + 4 Wood for 2 Ore = 4\u00d76 + 4\u00d710 = 64 vs 2\u00d734 = 68 (slightly unfavorable to me, but still rejected)\n\n**Value Calculation**\n- I need Ore most (highest value at 34)\n- Player 0 values Ore highly and has Brick as valuable (30) but scarce\n\n**Revised Strategy**\nI'll make a more generous offer that gives Player 0 excellent value:\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick, 5 Sheep -> 4 Ore]\n\nThis gives Player 0:\n- 5\u00d730 + 5\u00d713 = 150 + 65 = 215 value\n- In exchange for: 4\u00d734 = 136 value\n- This is a clear value add for Player 0 with 79 points of profit\n\nThis seems much more likely to be accepted as it provides significant value to Player 0 while helping me consolidate higher-value resources.",

The last three proposals all asked for Ore (the highest-value resource) while giving away lower-value bundles, so Player 0 likely values Ore very highly.  To break the stalemate I must either (a) overpay for Ore, or (b) offer something Player 0 actually wants without taking Ore.\n\nWhat Player 0 might accept  \n- They have never offered anything, so we have no direct information.  \n- The only repeated rejection pattern is \u201cOre outflow refused,\u201d so shifting to a non-Ore request seems safer.  \n- Brick and Sheep are the scarcest goods in my inventory (6 Brick, 7 Sheep).  Offering to swap surplus Wheat/Wood for Brick or Sheep could look attractive to Player 0 because those resources are currently worth 30 and 13 each.\n\nProposed deal (no Ore involved)  \nI give: 7 Wheat, 3 Wood\u2003(total value 7\u00b76 + 3\u00b710 = 72)  \nI ask: 2 Brick\u2003(value 2\u00b730 = 60)  \n\nNet for me: +12 value (72 \u2192 60), but I gain scarce Brick and offload abundant Wheat/Wood.  \nNet for Player 0: +12 value (60 \u2192 72) and they receive flexible Wheat/Wood instead of giving up Ore.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]",
