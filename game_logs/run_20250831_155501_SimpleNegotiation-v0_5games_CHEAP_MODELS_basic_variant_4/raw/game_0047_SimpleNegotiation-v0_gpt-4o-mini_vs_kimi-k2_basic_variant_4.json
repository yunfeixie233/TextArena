My strategic posture is \u201ctake small incremental positive-value trades when presented, never give discounts.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll start Turn X (next up) with the following small profit one:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 2 Wheat]  \n\nNet to Player 0 (if accepted): sends 36 + 10 = 46, receives 45 + 50 = 95 \u2192 +49 for them  \nNet to me: receives 46, sends 95 \u2192 although outwardly negative, that is because I initiated the syntax.  Re-phrase so I give 3 Sheep+2 Brick, I get 1 Ore+2 Wheat:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 2 Wheat]\n\nValue to me (if accepted):  \nBEFORE  \u2026 3*15 + 2*25 = 45 + 50 = 95  \nAFTER   \u2026 1*36 + 2*5  = 36 + 10 = 46 \u2192 still negative!  Need slightly more.  \n\nBumping offer wheat to 3:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 3 Wheat]  \nMy gain if accepted: (36+3\u00d75) \u2013 (45+50) = 51 \u2013 95 = -44  (still loss)\n\nIncrease Ore demanded to 2:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 2 Ore]  \nMy gain: 2*36 \u2013 (45+50) = 72 \u2013 95 = -23\n\nStill negative.  There is no way I can extract strictly positive value from the above components.\n\nNote my Ore stack has grown to 9 (highest valuation resource), and Brick is precisely the costlier mid-tier resource most vulnerable to over-supply dumps elsewhere in the meta-game.\n\nTherefore the most rational positive leverage I have is to swap the opposite direction: offload excess Ore for Brick AND replenish the Sheep I\u2019ve been hemorrhaging.\n\nRefining:\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick, 2 Sheep]  \n\nValue to me BEFORE: 36  \nValue to me AFTER : 2*25 + 2*15 = 50 + 30 = 80 \u2192 net +44 pure alpha  \nThat is strictly EV-positive only if I trade the opposite way (\u201cgive Ore, receive stuff\u201d), but the transfer financials positive for me.\n\nIn that structure, I am the giver of Ore.  The syntax needs me as the left side:\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick, 2 Sheep]\n\nI offer the one Ore I can spare comfortably (still leaving me 8), while grabbing two Brick (which Player 0 will suddenly value highly after depleting theirs) plus regenerating the Sheep supply \u2013 Sheep valuation is capped but still popular downstream.\n\n===== Final proposal =====  \n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick, 2 Sheep]",
