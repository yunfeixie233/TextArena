Here are a few potential strategies for your next move:\n\n1. **Diversify Offers**: Instead of focusing on just Ore, consider offering different combinations that involve other resources as well. This might attract a better response.\n\n2. **Trade for More Valuable Resources**: Aiming for resources that have a high value-to-quantity ratio could be beneficial.\n\n3. **Lower Demand for Ore**: Since Player 1 has rejected offers for Ore, it might be useful to lower your expectations or include items they value more.\n\n**Next Offer Suggestion:**\nI propose the following trade offer:\n\n``` \n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Ore, 2 Sheep]\n```\n\nThis offer includes a good quantity of Wheat and Wood while requesting an Ore and additional Sheep, potentially aligning more with what Player 1 may find appealing. \n\nPlease let me know if you want to proceed with this offer or if you would like to adjust it!",
