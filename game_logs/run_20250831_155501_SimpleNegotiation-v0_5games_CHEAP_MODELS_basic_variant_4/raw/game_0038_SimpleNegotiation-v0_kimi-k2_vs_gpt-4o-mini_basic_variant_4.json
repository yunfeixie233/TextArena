A trade that involves utilizing Sheep or Wood to obtain Ore could be advantageous.\n   \n3. **Proposed Action**:\n   - As Player 1, I will make the following offer to Player 0:\n\n```plaintext\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 4 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\n```\n\nThis offer uses excess Wood and Sheep to acquire more ore, which is critical for growing resources further. \n\nLet\u2019s proceed with the trade action!",
