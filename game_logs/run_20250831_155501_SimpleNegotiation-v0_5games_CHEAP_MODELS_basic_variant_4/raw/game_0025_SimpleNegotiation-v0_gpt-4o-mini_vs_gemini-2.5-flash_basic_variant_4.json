I need to make an offer.\n\nLooking at my resources, I have a good amount of [Brick] and [Ore].\n[Brick] is worth 22 and I have 12.\n[Ore] is worth 34 and I have 9.\n\nI want to trade for resources that are of high value or that I have a low quantity of and need more of.\n[Wheat] is my lowest quantity resource, only 5. It's also the lowest value per unit and I have it in low quantities.\n\nLet's try to trade something I have in abundance for something I might need more of or is highly valuable.\nI have a lot of [Wood], 13 units, but its value is quite low (12).\n[Sheep] is also decent at 8 units, value 13.\n\nPlayer 0 previously offered 10 Wheat, 3 Sheep for 1 Ore, 2 Brick.\nMy Offer: 1 Ore + 2 Brick = 34 + 2*22 = 34 + 44 = 78\nPlayer 0's Demand: 10 Wheat + 3 Sheep = 10*5 + 3*13 = 50 + 39 = 89\nThis was a bad deal for me in terms of raw value. My previous offer where I copied Player 0's request for my offer was also a bad deal. I should not have copied that.\n\nLet's analyze what player 0 was asking for. They were offering items worth 89 for items worth 78. That was a good deal for them, which is why I rejected it.\nMy previous offer to Player 0 was a copy of their previous request:\n[Offer: 1 Ore, 2 Brick -> 10 Wheat, 3 Sheep]\nMy Offer: 1 Ore + 2 Brick = 34 + 2*22 = 78\nMy Demand: 10 Wheat + 3 Sheep = 10*5 + 3*13 = 89\nThis means I was offering 78 value for 89 value. This means it was a good deal for me. I should have made this offer previously.  Player 0 rejected it.\n\nPlayer 0 rejected it, probably because they wanted to gain value themselves, not give it away.\n\nLet's try to offer something I have a decent amount of for something more valuable.\nI have a good amount of [Brick] (12 units, value 22).\nI have a good amount of [Wood] (13 units, value 12).\n\nWhat if I try to trade my low-value [Wood] for something more valuable?\nI have a lot of [Wood]. Player 0 might need it.\nPerhaps 5 Wood for 1 Ore?\nMy offer: 5 Wood = 5*12 = 60\nMy demand: 1 Ore = 34\nThis is bad for me. What about 1 Ore for 5 Wood? That would be good for me.\n\nLet's try to trade some of my excess [Brick] for [Ore].\nHow about 1 [Ore] for 2 [Brick]?\nMy offer: 1 [Ore] = 34\nMy demand: 2 [Brick] = 2 * 22 = 44\nThis is a good deal for me. Player 0 might not accept it as it gives me value.\n\nWhat about something balanced or slightly in my favor?\nMaybe I can trade some [Wood] and [Sheep] for [Ore].\nI have 13 Wood (value 12) and 8 Sheep (value 13).\nHow about 5 Wood + 5 Sheep for 3 Brick?\nOffer: 5 Wood + 5 Sheep = 5*12 + 5*13 = 60 + 65 = 125\nDemand: 3 Brick = 3*22 = 66\nThis is a terrible offer for me.\n\nLet's look at the previous offer rejected by Player 0, where I tried to get 89 value for 78 value.\n[Offer: 1 Ore, 2 Brick -> 10 Wheat, 3 Sheep]\nPlayer 0 rejected it. This means Player 0 likely will not accept offers where they lose significant value.\n\nI should try to offer something I have in high quantity or low value for something I need or is high value.\nI have 12 [Brick] and 9 [Ore]. These are my most valuable per unit.\nI have 13 [Wood]. This is my lowest value per unit in high quantity.\n\nLet's try to trade some [Wood] for some [Ore] or [Brick].\nOffer: 5 Wood = 60\nDemand: 2 Brick = 44 (Bad for me)\nDemand: 1 Ore = 34 (Bad for me)\n\nWhat about offering several low-value items for one high-value item?\nOffer: 8 Wood -> 2 Ore\nMy offer: 8 * 12 = 96\nMy demand: 2 * 34 = 68\nThis is bad for me.\n\nI need to make an offer that is appealing to Player 0 while still increasing my net worth.\nI am trying to convert lower value items into higher value items.\nI have plenty of [Wood] and [Brick].\nWhat if I offer a mix of items?\n\nLet's try to get more [Ore] or [Sheep]. [Ore] is highest value. [Sheep] I have only 8. [Wheat] only 5.\n\nLet's try to get rid of some [Wood] and [Brick] to get [Ore].\nOffer: 5 Wood, 3 Brick -> 2 Ore\nOffer value: 5*12 + 3*22 = 60 + 66 = 126\nDemand value: 2*34 = 68\nThis is absolutely terrible for me. I am giving away double the value. Player 0 would accept this. But I shouldn't offer this.\n\nI need to make an offer where the value of what I get is more than what I give.\nWhat if I offer 1 [Brick] for 2 [Sheep]?\nOffer: 1 Brick = 22\nDemand: 2 Sheep = 2*13 = 26\nThis is a good deal for me. I give 22 value and get 26 value. Player 0 might accept this if they need [Brick]. I have 12 [Brick], so I can spare one.\n\nLet's try to get more [Wheat]. I only have 5. But [Wheat] isn't very valuable.\nHow about I try to consolidate my resources into fewer, more valuable types if possible, or increase quantities of higher-value items.\n\nLet's stick with an offer that favors me slightly, but is not outrageous.\nMy previous offer to Player 0 was a good deal for me, but they rejected it.\nOffer: 1 Ore, 2 Brick (Value 78) -> 10 Wheat, 3 Sheep (Value 89) (Rejected by Player 0)\n\nWhat if I reverse that and offer Player 0 a deal that is slightly in their favor?\nIf I offer 10 Wheat, 3 Sheep (value 89) for 1 Ore, 2 Brick (value 78).\nI give 89 value and get 78 value. This is a net loss of 11 for me. I should NOT DO THIS.\n\nI need to offer a deal that is beneficial for me. My objective is to grow my fortune.\nLet's try to get some [Ore]. I have 9. I want more.\nMaybe I can trade some [Brick] for [Ore].\nIf 1 [Ore] is 34, and 1 [Brick] is 22.\nWhat if I offer 2 [Brick] for 1 [Ore]?\nOffer: 2 Brick = 44\nDemand: 1 Ore = 34\nThis is bad for me. I give 44 for 34.\n\nWhat about 3 [Sheep] for 1 [Brick]?\nOffer: 3 Sheep = 3*13 = 39\nDemand: 1 Brick = 22\nThis is bad for me.\n\nI need to focus on what I want to obtain. I want high-value items, or items I am short on (Wheat, Sheep).\nWhat about trading some [Wood]? I have a lot of [Wood].\nOffer: 5 Wood -> 1 Ore\nValue offer: 5*12 = 60\nValue demand: 1*34 = 34\nThis is a terrible deal for me. Player 0 would probably accept.\n\nHow about trying to trade some [Brick] for [Ore]?\nI have 12 [Brick]. [Brick] is pretty valuable. Maybe I can trade 3 [Brick] for 2 [Ore]?\nMy Offer: 3 Brick = 3 * 22 = 66\nMy Demand: 2 Ore = 2 * 34 = 68\nThis is a small gain for me (+2 value). Player 0 might accept this as it is relatively balanced. I am slightly increasing my value and getting more high-value [Ore].\nI have enough [Brick] (12) to make this trade. I have 9 [Ore]. Gaining 2 [Ore] would be nice.\n\nLet's go with this. It's a fair offer for Player 0 (they lose only 2 value), and I gain 2 value, and convert some [Brick] to [Ore].\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]",
