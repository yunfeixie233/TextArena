Wood is relatively less abundant compared to others.\n\n#### Making an Offer\n\nConsidering our resources and their values, a potential trade could involve offering some of our abundant or moderately valued resources for something that either increases our count of highly valued resources or complements our existing resources.\n\nLet's create an offer:\n- We could offer some Brick (abundant and valuable) and possibly some Sheep (valuable) for Ore (extremely valuable) or other valuable resources.\n\nExample Offer:\n```\n[Offer: 8 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 4 Ore]\n```\n\nLet's send this offer:\n```\n[Offer: 8 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 4 Ore]\n```\n\n### Action\n\n```\n[Offer: 8 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 4 Ore]\n```",

Starting inventory  \n   Wheat 24, Wood 16, Sheep 15, Brick 9, Ore 22  \n\n2. First accepted trade (Turn 3)  \n   Gave: 9 Brick + 5 Sheep  \n   Got: 3 Ore + 8 Wood  \n   New totals:  \n   Wheat 24, Wood 24, Sheep 10, Brick 0, Ore 25  \n\n3. Second accepted trade (Turn 4)  \n   Gave: 6 Ore + 6 Wood  \n   Got: 5 Sheep + 8 Wheat  \n   New totals:  \n   Wheat 32, Wood 18, Sheep 15, Brick 0, Ore 19  \n\n4. No trades accepted since Turn 4, so my current inventory is:  \n   Wheat 32, Wood 18, Sheep 15, Brick 0, Ore 19  \n\n5.
