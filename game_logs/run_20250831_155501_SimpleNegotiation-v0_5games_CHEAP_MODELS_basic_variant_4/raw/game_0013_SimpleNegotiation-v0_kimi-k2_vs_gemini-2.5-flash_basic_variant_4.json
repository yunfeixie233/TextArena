      "response": "[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 3 Wood] is a bad offer for Player 1.\n- Player 0 is offering 5 Sheep, which is worth 5 * 16 = 80.\n- Player 0 is asking for 3 Wood, which is worth 3 * 11 = 33.\n- Player 1 would lose 80 - 33 = 47 value.\n\nPlayer 1's best counter-offer is to try and get more value for their Wood, or less Wood for Player 0's Sheep.\nLet's try to get more for the Wood:\nMaybe 1 Wood for 5 Sheep?\n- 1 Wood is worth 11.\n- 5 Sheep is worth 80.\n- Player 1 would gain 80 - 11 = 69 value. This is a very good deal.\n\nLet's check the current inventory:\n- Wheat: 16 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 24 (Value: 11)\n- Sheep: 23 (Value: 16)\n- Brick: 19 (Value: 28)\n- Ore: 10 (Value: 36)\n\nPlayer 1 has plenty of Wood to offer.\nPlayer 1 has enough Sheep.\n\nThe best strategy for Player 1 is to maximize the value received from any trade.\n\nConsider the initial offer from Player 0: 5 Sheep -> 3 Wood.\nPlayer 1's perspective:\n- Giving away 3 Wood (value 3 * 11 = 33)\n- Receiving 5 Sheep (value 5 * 16 = 80)\n- Net gain for Player 1 = 80 - 33 = 47.\nWait, my initial assessment was wrong. Player 0 is offering 5 Sheep *to* Player 1, and asking for 3 Wood *from* Player 1.\nSo, Player 1 *receives* 5 Sheep and *gives* 3 Wood. This is a good deal for Player 1!\n\nMy previous analysis had it reversed. Let me re-evaluate.\nPlayer 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 5 Sheep -> Requested items: 3 Wood\n\nThis means: Player 0 gives 5 Sheep to Player 1. Player 1 gives 3 Wood to Player 0.\nValue for Player 1:\n+ 5 Sheep (5 * 16 = 80)\n- 3 Wood (3 * 11 = 33)\nNet value change for Player 1 = +80 - 33 = +47.\n\nThis is a **good offer** for Player 1.
