      "response": "Here's my thought process for responding to the game prompt:\n\n1.  **Understand My Role:** I am \"Player 1,\" a competitive game player. My goal is to grow my fortune.\n\n2.  **Analyze Current State:**\n    *   **My Assets:**\n        *   Wheat: 22 @ 5 = 110\n        *   Wood: 5 @ 8 = 40\n        *   Sheep: 24 @ 12 = 288\n        *   Brick: 19 @ 27 = 513\n        *   Ore: 19 @ 38 = 722\n        *   **Total Value: 1673**\n    *   **Opponent's Last Action:** \"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 2 Ore\"\n\n3.  **Evaluate Player 0's Offer (Value Calculation):**\n    *   **Player 0 Offers (to me):**\n        *   5 Wheat @ 5 = 25\n        *   2 Wood @ 8 = 16\n        *   *Total Value Offered to Me = 41*\n    *   **Player 0 Requests (from me):**\n        *   2 Ore @ 38 = 76\n    *   **Analysis:** Player 0 is asking for 76 value for a mere 41 value. This is a *terrible* deal for me. It diminishes my fortune. I should *never* accept a deal where the value I give up is significantly higher than the value I receive.\n\n4.  **Consider Previous Turn's Context:**\n    *   Last turn: Player 0 offered `5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 4 Sheep`. I *rejected* this.\n        *   Value Offered to me: 5 Wheat (25) + 2 Wood (16) = 41\n        *   Value Requested from me: 1 Ore (38) + 4 Sheep (48) = 86\n        *   This was also a terrible deal. My rejection was correct.\n    *   My previous action: \"Player 1 made no new trade offer.\" This implies I *could* have made an offer after rejecting Player 0's offer. This is an important mechanic to remember.\n\n5.  **Formulate a Strategy:**\n    *   **Reject current offer:** The offer `5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore` is massively unfavorable (41 value for 76 value). I must reject it.\n    *   **Counter-offer for value:** Since I rejected, I should now make *my own* offer. My objective is to increase my fortune. This means I want to trade away resources I have in abundance or those that are less valuable *to me* for resources that are more valuable *to me* or that I want to accumulate.\n    *   **What do I have?**\n        *   Wheat (22 qty, low value 5)\n        *   Wood (5 qty, low value 8) -- *Low quantity, might want to keep or trade carefully.*\n        *   Sheep (24 qty, mid value 12)\n        *   Brick (19 qty, high value 27)\n        *   Ore (19 qty, high value 38)\n    *   **What might Player 0 want?** They just offered Wheat and Wood. This suggests they might have a surplus of those or need Ore/Sheep.\n    *   **What do I want?** I want to acquire high-value items, especially Ore or Brick, by giving up lower-value items (Wheat, Sheep).\n    *   **How to make a profitable offer?** I need to offer less value than I request. However, Player 0 won't accept a *huge* discrepancy. I need to make an offer that feels *slightly* favorable to me but *plausible* for Player 0 to accept.\n    *   **Brainstorming Trade Ideas:**\n        *   Trade Wheat/Sheep for Ore/Brick.\n        *   Target Ore: It's the highest value.\n        *   Target Brick: Also high value.\n    *   **Let's try to get 1 Ore (value 38):**\n        *   What can I give for it?\n            *   Say 5 Sheep (5 * 12 = 60) - Too much.\n            *   Say 3 Sheep (3 * 12 = 36) - Hmm, slightly less, P0 might accept if they value sheep less.\n            *   Say 7 Wheat (7 * 5 = 35) - Close, but I have a lot of Wheat.\n            *   What about a mix? 2 Sheep (24) + 2 Wheat (10) = 34. This is slightly in my favor.\n            *   What if I offer something P0 *just* offered? They offered 5 Wheat, 2 Wood (value 41) for 2 Ore (value 76).\n            *   If I want 1 Ore (38), maybe I can offer something they seem to have a surplus of and value less.\n            *   Let's try to get 1 Ore for something clearly less valuable to me, but acceptable to P0.\n            *   What about 3 Sheep (36) for 1 Ore (38)? That's too close to equal. I want a profit.\n            *   What about 4 Sheep (48) for 1 Ore (38)? This would be profitable for P0, bad for me.\n            *   **My goal:** Receive > Give.\n            *   Let's aim for 1 Ore (38 value).\n            *   I have 22 Wheat (Value 5). I can afford to shed Wheat.\n            *   I have 24 Sheep (Value 12). I can afford to shed Sheep.\n            *   Offer: 8 Wheat (40 value) -> 1 Ore (38 value)? Still not profitable enough.\n            *   Offer: 7 Wheat (35 value) for 1 Ore (38 value) - Good for me! But P0 might reject.\n            *   Offer: 6 Sheep (72 value) for 2 Ore (76 value)? Good for me.\n            *   Let's try a small profit.\n            *   **Consider their last offer rejected:** P0 offered 5 Wheat (25) + 2 Wood (16) = 41 total value to get 2 Ore (76 total value). This means P0 is willing to give low-value items for high-value items.\n            *   My strategy should be similar: give low-value for high-value.\n            *   I have plenty of Wheat and Sheep. Ore and Brick are my most valuable.\n            *   **Let's try to get Ore.**\n            *   If I offer 3 Wheat (15) and 2 Sheep (24) for 1 Ore (38).\n                *   Value given: 15 + 24 = 39.\n                *   Value received: 38.\n                *   Still not profitable for *me*.\n            *   What if I offer stuff that's truly abundant and low value for *their* abundant stuff? No, I want high value.\n            *   What if I offer 1 Brick (27) for 1 Ore (38)? Profitable! But why would P0 accept? They probably want to *keep* their Ore.\n            *   **Let's look at relative values:**\n                *   Wheat: 5\n                *   Wood: 8\n                *   Sheep: 12\n                *   Brick: 27\n                *   Ore: 38\n            *   **Possible profitable trades for me:**\n                *   Trade Wheat/Sheep for Brick/Ore.\n                *   Example: 6 Wheat (30) for 1 Brick (27)? Minor loss.\n                *   Example: 3 Sheep (36) for 1 Ore (38)? Minor personal loss, gain for P0. No.\n                *   Example: 2 Sheep (24) for 1 Brick (27)? Profitable for *me* (+3 value). This is a good candidate. I have plenty of Sheep, 19 Brick.\n                *   Example: 3 Wheat (15) for 1 Wood (8)? No.\n                *   Example: 5 Wheat (25) for 2 Wood (16)? No.\n                *   Example: 8 Wheat (40) for 1 Brick (27)? Loss for me.\n                *   **I need to gain value.**\n                *   Offer: 4 Sheep (48) for 1 Ore (38)? No, loss for me.\n                *   Offer: 3 Sheep (36) for 1 Ore (38)? No, loss for me.\n                *   Okay, I need to make an offer where the value of what I *give* is *less* than the value of what I *receive*.\n                *   What if I target *their* low-value items to improve my high-value items? No, I only want *more* value.\n                *   **Let's try to get 1 *Brick* (27) because it's slightly easier to trade for than Ore.**\n                *   What can I give for 1 Brick that's less than 27 value but plausible for P0?\n                    *   5 Wheat (25) for 1 Brick (27)? This gains me 2 value. It's a small gain, but a gain. Player 0 might accept because they want Wheat. I have 22 Wheat. Seems plausible.\n                    *   `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n                *   What about 2 Sheep (24) for 1 Brick (27)? Gains me 3 value. I have plenty of Sheep. This is better.\n                    *   `[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]`\n                *   What about combining?\n                    *   3 Wheat (15) + 1 Wood (8) = 23 value. For 1 Brick (27)? Gain of 4. I only have 5 Wood, so I'm hesitant to trade it unless the profit is significant.\n                *   Let's stick with my abundant resources. Wheat and Sheep.\n                *   `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n                *   `[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]`\n                *   The 2 Sheep option is slightly better for me in terms of value gained (+3 vs +2) and Sheep is a higher base value resource, so trading them for an even higher one makes sense.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   Reject Player 0's offer `5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore` (Value 41 -> Value 76). This is a clear loss for me.\n    *   Make a counter-offer that gains me value.\n    *   My chosen counter-offer: `[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]`.\n        *   Value given: 2 Sheep * 12 = 24\n        *   Value received: 1 Brick * 27 = 27\n        *   Net gain for me: +3 value.\n        *   This is a plausible offer for Player 0 if they value Sheep or need them, and are willing to part with a Brick.\n\n7.  **Format the Response:** Follow the specified action tokens.\n\n```\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\n```",
