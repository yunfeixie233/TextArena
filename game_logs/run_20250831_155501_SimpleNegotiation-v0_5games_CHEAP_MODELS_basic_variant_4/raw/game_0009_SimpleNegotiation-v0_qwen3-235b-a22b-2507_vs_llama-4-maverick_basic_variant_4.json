Your lowest value item is Wheat (Value: 5).\n\n2. **Trade Strategy:** To maximize your fortune, you should aim to trade lower-value items for higher-value ones.\n\n3. **Current Holdings:** You have a good quantity of Ore and Brick, which are high-value. However, trading away too much of these might not be strategic unless you're getting a significantly better deal.\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nTo make a strategic move, let's examine potential trades:\n\n1. **Consider Trading Lower-Value Items:** You have 24 Wheat (Value: 5) and 7 Wood (Value: 9). Trading these for higher-value items could be beneficial.\n\n2. **Formulate an Offer:** An example could be trading some Wheat or Wood for Sheep (Value: 16), as it's a higher value than Wheat and Wood.\n\nLet's formulate an offer: `[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]`.\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 10 Wheat, 0 Wood -> 0 Ore, 2 Sheep]`, simplifying the offer format to match the required pattern.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]`\n\nOr, in the required format:\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat, 0 Wood -> 0 Ore, 2 Sheep]`\n\nLet's proceed with the action in the correct format:\n\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat, 0 Wood -> 2 Sheep]` is adjusted to fit the exact pattern as: \n`[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]` is the core, so in the exact required format, it is `[Offer: 10 Wheat, 0 Wood -> 0 Ore, 2 Sheep]`.\n\nThe final action in the required format is: \n `[Offer: 10 Wheat, 0 Wood -> 0 Ore, 2 Sheep]`.",

We have a good quantity of Ore but are somewhat low on Brick after the last trade.\n\n2. **Needs and Surpluses**:\n   - We are relatively low on Sheep (Qty: 4) and could benefit from more.\n   - We have a surplus of Wheat and Ore.\n\n3. **Trade Strategy**:\n   - Since our previous offers were rejected, we need to rethink our proposal. \n   - Given our surplus and needs, a reasonable offer could involve exchanging some of our surplus for Sheep or other valuable resources.\n\n4. **Proposed Trade**:\n   - Considering our need for Sheep and the rejection of our previous offers involving Wheat and Ore, let's try offering something different. We could offer some Brick (our second most valuable resource after Ore) for Sheep.\n\n#### Action:\nLet's propose: `[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Sheep]`\n\nThis offer is less demanding in terms of what we are asking for (2 Sheep) and involves giving away Brick, which we still have a considerable quantity of, but not as much as Ore or Wheat.\n\n**Action Token**: `[Offer: 3 Brick, 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Ore -> 2 Sheep]` simplifies to `[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Sheep]`.\n\nLet's execute: `[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Sheep]`",
