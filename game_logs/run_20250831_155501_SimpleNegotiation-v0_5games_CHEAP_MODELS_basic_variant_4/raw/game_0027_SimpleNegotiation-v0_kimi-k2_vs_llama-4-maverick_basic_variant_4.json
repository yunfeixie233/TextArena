Total value given away = 96 + 100 = 196.\n- Receiving: 10 Ore (Value: 10*37 = 370) and 4 Brick (Value: 4*24 = 96). Total value received = 370 + 96 = 466.\n\nThe total value received (466) is greater than the total value given away (196), indicating the offer is favorable in terms of value. However, we need to consider if we can actually fulfill the offer.\n\nSince we only have 5 Sheep and the offer requires 8 Sheep, we cannot fulfill this part of the demand. Thus, we cannot accept this offer as it stands because it requires more Sheep than we possess.\n\nGiven this, our best course of action is to '[Deny]' the offer because we cannot fulfill the requested quantity of Sheep.\n\nAction: [Deny]",

They demanded 8 Sheep and 10 Wood in the first turn and 5 Sheep and 5 Wood in the third turn.\n\nLet's formulate a new offer that could be more appealing to Player 0 and still beneficial to us.\n\n### Proposed Offer:\n- We could offer something that aligns with their interests while considering our own resource valuation.\n\nLet's directly propose: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]`\n\n- **Our Offer:** 3 Wheat (Value: 3*6 = 18) and 1 Sheep (Value: 1*12 = 12), totaling a value of 30.\n- **Our Demand:** 2 Brick (Value: 2*24 = 48).\n\nThis offer seems more balanced as we're not overpaying relative to what we're getting.

      "response": "To respond to the last state of the game, let's analyze the situation and the last trade offer made by Player 0.\n\n### Current Holdings After Last Trade:\nAfter accepting Player 0's offer: [Offered items: 7 Wheat -> Requested items: 2 Sheep, 2 Wood], let's update Player 1's holdings.\n\n- Before the trade:\n  + [Wheat]   Qty: 14   Value: 6\n  + [Wood]    Qty: 9    Value: 10 (since 3 were given in the previous turn)\n  + [Sheep]   Qty: 3    Value: 12 (since 2 were given in the previous turn)\n  + [Brick]   Qty: 8    Value: 24\n  + [Ore]     Qty: 16   Value: 37\n\n- After receiving 7 Wheat and giving 2 Sheep and 2 Wood:\n  + [Wheat]   Qty: 21   Value: 6\n  + [Wood]    Qty: 7    Value: 10\n  + [Sheep]   Qty: 1    Value: 12\n  + [Brick]   Qty: 8    Value: 24\n  + [Ore]     Qty: 16   Value: 37\n\n### Analysis:\nThe last trade significantly boosted Player 1's Wheat quantity, which might not be the most valuable resource but can be useful for future trades. The reduction in Sheep and Wood could be a concern, but the current holdings still have a good mix.\n\n### Next Action:\nTo make a new offer, let's look at the current market and holdings. A strategic move could involve trying to acquire more valuable resources or getting rid of less valuable ones.\n\nConsidering the value and quantity:\n- Acquiring more Brick or Ore would be valuable as they have high values (24 and 37 respectively).\n- Wheat is relatively less valuable (Value: 6), so potentially offering some Wheat for a more valuable resource could be a good strategy.\n\nLet's make an offer that gives away some Wheat (since it's not very valuable) and tries to acquire a more valuable resource.\n\n### Proposed Trade:\n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\n\nThis trade gives away 8 Wheat (reducing the quantity to 13) in exchange for 1 Brick, which would increase the Brick quantity to 9.\n\n**Action:** [Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
