I want to try to trade some less valuable resources for more valuable ones, or consolidate some resources.\n\nLet's try to trade Ore for Brick or Sheep, as I have a lot of Ore, and Brick and Sheep are also quite valuable. Alternatively, I can trade some low value resources for higher value ones.\n\nI'll try to trade some Wheat and Wood for something more valuable like Brick or Ore.\nHowever, I have plenty of Ore, so I'd rather get Brick or Sheep.\n\nLet's try to trade some of my excess Ore for Brick, as Brick is also valuable and I have a good amount of Ore. I want to make sure the value of what I receive is greater than what I offer.\n\nValue of 1 Ore: 40\nValue of 1 Brick: 23\n\nIf I offer 1 Ore, I'd want at least 2 Brick (46 value) to make it worthwhile.\nOr, I could offer some lower value items for something more valuable.\n\nLet's test an offer to get more value.\nI have a lot of Ore. I could perhaps trade 1 Ore for something like 2 Brick.\n1 Ore (40) -> 2 Brick (46). This is a good trade for me, value-wise.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]",
