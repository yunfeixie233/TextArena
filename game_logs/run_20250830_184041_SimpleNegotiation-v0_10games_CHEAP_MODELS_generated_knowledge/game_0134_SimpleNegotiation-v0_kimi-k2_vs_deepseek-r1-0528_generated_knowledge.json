Either way, the counts above are what I need to use from here onward.\n\nCurrent inventory and marginal value:\n\nWheat  12 \u00d7 5  = 60  \nWood   15 \u00d7 8  = 120  \nSheep  17 \u00d7 14 = 238  \nBrick  18 \u00d7 21 = 378  \nOre    25 \u00d7 33 = 825  \n\nTotal so far \u2192 1 621.\n\nIn the last offer I received:  \n[Offer: 1 Sheep \u2192 2 Wood, 1 Wheat]\n\nI lose 1 Sheep (14 value), gain 2 Wood (16 value), 1 Wheat (5 value).  \nNet change: 21 - 14 = +7 value.\n\nSince this is the only potato left on the table and it is mildly favourable, let\u2019s take it.\n\n[Accept]",
