Offered 130, Requested 160. This would be a good deal for me (+30 value).\nI want to get Brick and Ore, those are the highest value.\nLet's try something that is slightly beneficial to me but not outrageously so, to encourage acceptance.\nWhat if I offer a mix of low and medium value items.\nI'll offer some Wheat and Wood.\nI have 10 Wheat (60) and 7 Wood (63).\nWhat if I offer 5 Wood (45) + 5 Wheat (30) = 75 value.\nFor this, I would request something like 2 Brick (48) + 1 Ore (32) = 80 value. This is a small gain of 5. Or maybe 3 Brick (72) + 1 Ore (32)? That's 104. Too much gain for me.\n\nLet's rethink my strategy. I need to ensure I'm proposing deals that are beneficial for me.\nMy current strategy is to gain higher-value items by giving away lower-value items.\n\nHow about trading a lot of low-value items for fewer high-value items?\nI have 10 Wheat (6) and 15 Sheep (13).\nI want to get Brick (24) and Ore (32).\n\nLet's try offering:\n5 Sheep (65) and 5 Wheat (30) = 95\nFor: 2 Brick (48) and 2 Ore (64) = 112.\nThis is a gain of 17 for me. It's a modest gain, so it might be accepted.\nIt also uses up some Wheat and Sheep, which are lower value.\n\nLet's try this offer.]\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 2 Brick, 2 Ore]",
