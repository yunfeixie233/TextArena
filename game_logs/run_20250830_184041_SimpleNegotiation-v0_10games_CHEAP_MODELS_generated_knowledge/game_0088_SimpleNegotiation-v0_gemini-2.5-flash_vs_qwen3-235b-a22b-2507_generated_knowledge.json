      "response": "Based on the last turn, Player 1 rejected my previous offer of 5 Wheat, 3 Wood for 2 Ore. This suggests they might value Ore highly or don't want to part with it for my current offer.\n\nMy goal is to increase the value of my resources. Ore and Brick have high individual values (36 and 24 respectively), while Wheat and Wood are lower (6 and 10). I have a good quantity of Sheep (17) which are moderately valued (13).\n\nLooking at my current inventory and what Player 1 might accept:\nI have a good amount of Wheat (15) and Wood (11). I can afford to offer more of these lower-value resources to gain higher-value ones.\nPlayer 1 accepted my previous offer of 5 Wheat, 3 Wood for 2 Brick. This indicates they might be willing to trade Brick for Wheat/Wood.\nPlayer 1 rejected 5 Wheat, 3 Wood for 2 Ore. This tells me I need to offer more for Ore, or aim for other high-value resources.\n\nLet's try to get Brick again, as Player 1 accepted that trade previously.\nI will offer a similar quantity of Wheat and Wood for Brick, but perhaps slightly more appealing if they are hesitant after the Ore refusal.\n\nCurrent Resources:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 15 Value: 6 (Total Value: 90)\n*   [Wood] Qty: 11 Value: 10 (Total Value: 110)\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 17 Value: 13 (Total Value: 221)\n*   [Brick] Qty: 8 Value: 24 (Total Value: 192)\n*   [Ore] Qty: 8 Value: 36 (Total Value: 288)\nTotal Value: 90 + 110 + 221 + 192 + 288 = 901\n\nConsider the previous accepted trade: 5 Wheat (30 value), 3 Wood (30 value) -> 2 Brick (48 value). I lost 12 value but increased my high-value resource count.\n\nLet's try to get more high-value resources.\n\nMaybe try a different combination or slight increase in the offer for Brick.\nWhat if I offer a mix including Sheep?\n\nLet's stick with the previously accepted resource type (Brick).\nIf 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick was accepted (value 60 for 48), maybe I can get more Brick for a similar offer.\nAlternatively, I can try to get Ore again, but I'll need to sweeten the deal significantly after the last rejection.\n\nLet's try for 3 Brick instead of 2.\n5 Wheat (30) + 3 Wood (30) = 60 value\n3 Brick = 72 value. This is a net gain for me (72-60 = 12). If accepted, it's a good trade.\n\nI will formulate another offer for Brick, as that was previously successful.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 3 Brick]",
