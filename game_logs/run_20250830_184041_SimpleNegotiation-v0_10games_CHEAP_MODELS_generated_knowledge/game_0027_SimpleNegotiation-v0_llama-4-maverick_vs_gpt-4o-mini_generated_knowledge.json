      "response": "To begin, let's assess the current situation and resources.\n\n### Current Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: 5 units, Value: 5 each\n- Wood: 18 units, Value: 12 each\n- Sheep: 9 units, Value: 15 each\n- Brick: 10 units, Value: 28 each\n- Ore: 6 units, Value: 34 each\n\n### Total Value Calculation:\nTo understand the initial total value, we calculate:\n- Wheat: 5 units * 5 = 25\n- Wood: 18 units * 12 = 216\n- Sheep: 9 units * 15 = 135\n- Brick: 10 units * 28 = 280\n- Ore: 6 units * 34 = 204\n- **Total Value = 25 + 216 + 135 + 280 + 204 = 860**\n\n### Strategy:\nTo increase the total value of resources, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or at least maintain the value while gaining more quantity if possible. \n\n### Initial Offer:\nLet's consider making an initial offer. We can look for opportunities to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values.\n\n1. **Identify Lower Value Resources:** We have Wheat (Value: 5) and Wood (Value: 12) as relatively lower value resources compared to others.\n   \n2. **Potential Trades:**\n   - We could trade Wheat for a resource that might be more valuable or keep its value.\n   - Trading Wood for a resource of equal or higher value per unit could be beneficial.\n\nGiven the values, a potential trade could involve offering some Wheat or Wood for other resources. Let's examine a potential trade:\n\n- Offering 5 Wheat (Value: 25) for resources. Since Wheat is the least valuable, we could consider trading it for any other resource. For instance, if we could get 2 Wood (Value: 24), it wouldn't be a significant gain, but it might be a starting point. However, a better deal would be to trade for resources with higher individual value like Sheep, Brick, or Ore.\n\nLet's make an initial offer that tries to exchange Wheat for Sheep, as Sheep is more valuable than Wheat and Wood:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'\n\nThis is a simple starting point. If the opponent accepts, we'll have 0 Wheat, 18 Wood, 10 Sheep, 10 Brick, and 6 Ore.\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.\n\n### Turn 1 Action:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'",

However, I need to carefully consider if this trade is beneficial. \n\nTo increase the total value, let's directly make a counteroffer or respond.\n\nGiven that my previous offers were rejected and the current offer from Player 1 is not very favorable, I'll make a counteroffer that could be more mutually beneficial.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]' is a possible counteroffer.

The value of 3 Brick = 3/10 * 28 = 8.4, and the value of 1 Ore = 34/6 \u2248 5.67.

      "response": "### Current State\n\nAfter analyzing the given information:\n\n- Current Resources:\n  - [Wheat]   Qty: 3    Value: 5\n  - [Wood]    Qty: 13   Value: 12\n  - [Sheep]   Qty: 9    Value: 15\n  - [Brick]   Qty: 10   Value: 28\n  - [Ore]     Qty: 7    Value: 34\n\n### Analysis of Previous Turns\n\n1. Initial Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep (Rejected)\n   - This offer was not beneficial as it decreased the total value (5 Wheat = 25, 1 Sheep = 15).\n\n2. Second Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore (Rejected)\n   - Although this increased the total value (4 Wheat = 20, 1 Ore = 34), it was rejected.\n\n3. Third Offer: 6 Wood -> 1 Ore (Rejected)\n   - The value of 6 Wood is 72 (6*12), and 1 Ore is 34, so this was not a good trade.\n\n4. Counter Offer from Player 1: 6 Wood -> 1 Ore (Rejected initially, later a variant was accepted)\n   - Initially rejected, but a modified version (5 Wood -> 1 Ore) was accepted, indicating that Player 1's offers were on the right track but needed some adjustment.\n\n5. Last Offer: 2 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 1 Ore (Rejected)\n   - The total value offered is (2*5) + (4*12) = 10 + 48 = 58, and the value requested is 34 (1 Ore). This was not a good trade.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\n\nGiven that the last trade offer (5 Wood -> 1 Ore) was accepted, it's clear that Player 1 is willing to trade Wood for Ore at a certain ratio. We should continue to explore trades that involve Ore, as it has a high value.\n\n1. **Evaluate Remaining Resources and Values:**\n   - We have 3 Wheat, 13 Wood, 9 Sheep, 10 Brick, and 7 Ore.\n\n2. **Formulate a New Offer:**\n   - Since the last accepted trade was 5 Wood for 1 Ore, we should think about what we can offer next that involves Ore or other valuable resources.\n\n3. **Potential Trades:**\n   - Offering Wood for Ore again could be viable if the ratio is right. We have 13 - 5 = 8 Wood left after the last trade.\n   - Another option is to see if we can negotiate for Sheep or Brick, as we have a considerable quantity of Wood.\n\n4. **Proposed Trade:**\n   - Let's consider offering some Wood for another Ore: [Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n     - Value given: 4 Wood = 48\n     - Value received: 1 Ore = 34\n     - This is not a good trade as it decreases our total value.\n\n   - Alternatively, let's think about other resources: [Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick]\n     - Value given: (3*15) + (2*12) = 45 + 24 = 69\n     - Value received: 2 Brick = 2*28 = 56\n     - This is not a good trade.\n\n### Decision\n\nLet's propose a trade that might be more balanced or beneficial. Since we've accepted a trade involving Wood and Ore, let's stick with a similar theme but adjust the quantities.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
