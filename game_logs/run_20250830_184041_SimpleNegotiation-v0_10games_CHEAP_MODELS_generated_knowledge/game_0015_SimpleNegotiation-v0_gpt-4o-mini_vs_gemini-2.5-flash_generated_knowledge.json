      "response": "The negotiations so far indicate that Player 0 is looking to acquire Brick and Sheep. My current analysis of their offers has led me to reject them, as I don't see a significant value increase for me in the terms they've proposed. For instance, their last offer of '3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 4 Brick, 3 Sheep' would involve me giving up 18 Wheat (value 108), 20 Wood (value 200) in exchange for 4 Brick (value 120) and 3 Sheep (value 39). This results in a loss of value for me, rather than a gain.\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I will aim for trades where the value of resources I receive significantly outweighs the value of resources I offer. Given the current situation, I should focus on leveraging my abundant Wheat, Wood, and Sheep, but only if they yield a good return in rarer, higher-value resources like Brick and Ore.\n\nI have 11 Wheat (Value 66), 23 Wood (Value 230), 19 Sheep (Value 247), 17 Brick (Value 510), and 19 Ore (Value 703). The total value of my resources is 1756.\n\nPlayer 0's last offer was: Offered items: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 4 Brick, 3 Sheep.\nThis offer is still not favorable to me.\n\nI will make a counter-offer that aims to increase my total resource value, specifically targeting more high-value resources like Brick or Ore. I will offer a combination of Wheat and Wood, as these are my most abundant and least valuable items.\n\nI will propose a substantial trade that would provide me with a clear value increase. I need to get at least 2 Brick per 100 value of resources I give away. Also, Player 0 seems interested in acquiring Brick and Sheep.\n\nLet's try to offer a good amount of my less valuable resources for some Brick.\n\nMy offer:\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 5 Brick]\nValue of 10 Wheat = 60\nValue of 10 Wood = 100\nTotal value offered = 160\n\nValue of 5 Brick = 150\nThis offer does not provide a value increase. I need to reconsider.\n\nLet's think about what Player 0 might need. They've asked for Brick and Sheep.\n\nI have a lot of Wood and Sheep. My Brick and Ore are very valuable to me, so I want to acquire more, not give them away.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wheat and Wood for some Ore?\n\nLet's propose something more beneficial to me. I need to increase my total value.\n\nMy current resource values:\nWheat: 11 * 6 = 66\nWood: 23 * 10 = 230\nSheep: 19 * 13 = 247\nBrick: 17 * 30 = 510\nOre: 19 * 37 = 703\nTotal: 1756\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 3 Wheat (18), 2 Wood (20) -> 4 Brick (120), 3 Sheep (39). This is terrible for me. Value given: 38. Value received: 159. This is good for me, so I should accept? Ah, I am Player 1. Player 0 offers me resources. Player 0 offered 3 Wheat, 2 Wood and requested 4 Brick, 3 Sheep. So Player 0 is offering 3 Wheat and 2 Wood. Player 0 is asking for 4 Brick and 3 Sheep.\nThis means I give 4 Brick (value 120) and 3 Sheep (value 39) for 3 Wheat (value 18) and 2 Wood (value 20).\nValue out: 120 + 39 = 159\nValue in: 18 + 20 = 38\nThis offer is terrible for me. I should reject it.\n\nLet's propose an offer that helps me.\nI have plenty of Wood and Sheep. Player 0 seems to want Brick and Sheep. I want more Brick and Ore.\n\nLet's offer some Wood and Sheep for Brick.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wood, 5 Sheep -> 3 Brick]\nValue offered: 10 Wood (100) + 5 Sheep (65) = 165\nValue requested: 3 Brick (90)\nThis is not good for me.\n\nI need to aim higher. I am player 1. I need to make an offer.\n\nLet's try to acquire Ore, my highest value resource.\n\n[Offer: 15 Wood, 5 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\nValue offered: 15 Wood (150) + 5 Sheep (65) = 215\nValue requested: 3 Ore (111)\nStill not good for me.\n\nI seem to be valuing my resources too highly or their resources too low. I should prioritize getting more high-value resources while giving away low-value resources.\n\nMaybe I look at it the other way: offer my plentiful cheap resources for scarce expensive ones.\n\nWhat if I offer a lot of Wheat and Wood for some Brick? Brick is decent value.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 4 Brick]\nValue of 10 Wheat = 60\nValue of 10 Wood = 100\nTotal value offered = 160\n\nValue of 4 Brick = 120\nStill a value loss for me.\n\nLet's make a more aggressive offer. I need to profit from the trade.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 6 Brick]\nValue Offered: 160\nValue Received: 180\nThis is a gain of 20. Let's try this.\n\nThis offers a small increase in value (+20). It also offloads some of my abundant Wheat and Wood inventories.\n\nI will also explicitly reject Player 0's last offer, as it was very unfavorable.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 6 Brick]",
