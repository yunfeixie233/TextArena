High quantity, and we tried trading 4 Sheep for 2 Ore (value 4.5 per Ore, which is below market value).

Player 1 rejected trading away Ore, suggesting they value it highly. We should **not** trade Ore away unless the return is excellent.\n3. **Brick**: Second-highest value (29/21 \u2248 1.38 per unit). Good to trade away if we can get higher-value items like Wheat/Wood/Ore.\n4. **Wheat**: Now 14 (value 7), but only 0.5 per unit \u2013 we should **avoid acquiring more Wheat**. The prior trade (5 Sheep for 2 Wheat) was poor in hindsight (Sheep: 1 per unit vs Wheat: 0.5 per unit).\n5. **Wood**: Only 6 quantity with value 12 (2 per unit). Good to acquire if possible.\n\n### Strategy\n- **Target**: Trade away excess Sheep or Brick for Ore or Wood (higher value per unit).\n- **Avoid**: Trading for Wheat or giving up Ore unless heavily overpaid.\n- **Next Offer**: Try trading **Brick** (less Sheep-heavy since prior Sheep trades failed).  \n\n### Proposed Offer\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 4 Ore]  \n- 5 Brick = 5 * 1.38 \u2248 6.9 value  \n- 4 Ore = 4 * 2.24 \u2248 8.96 value  \nThis slightly favors us but is reasonable since Brick\u2019s unit value is lower.  \n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 4 Ore]",

Thanks!  \nWith my updated totals, the valuations now look like this:\n\n- Wheat: 14 (still at value 6)  \n- Wood: 6 (value 12)  \n- Sheep: 13 (value 18)  \n- Brick: 16 (value 29)  \n- Ore: 18 (value 38)\n\nSheep is still my least-valuable (18 total), while Ore is the most valuable (38). To keep increasing the total value in my possession, I\u2019d like to convert more Sheep into Ore.  \nCould you do:\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 3 Ore]",
