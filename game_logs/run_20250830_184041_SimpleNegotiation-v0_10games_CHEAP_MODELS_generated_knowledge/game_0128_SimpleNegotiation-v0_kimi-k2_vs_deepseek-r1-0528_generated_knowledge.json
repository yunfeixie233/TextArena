That is worse for me.\n\nTherefore I must decline.\n\nAdditionally, the earlier pattern suggests I have too little Ore, Wood, or both from Player 1\u2019s perspective. I can remedy that while still turning a profit for myself.\n\nWhat I really need is more of the scarce high-value Ore, but giving up lots of Wheat or Wood at a 5-to-1 or 12-to-1 rate is painful. Brick, on the other hand, is plentiful to me (24 value), yet Player 1 seems hungry for it (they asked for 4 Brick earlier).\n\nPlan: Offer Player 1 Brick in exchange for Ore at a ratio that improves my total value while still sounding reasonable to them.\n\nValue check on a 4 Brick \u2192 1 Ore swap (which Player 1 previously signaled is acceptable):\n- Me: \u20134 Brick \u00d7 24 = \u201396 value; +1 Ore \u00d7 37 = +37 value \u2192 net \u201359 (unattractive).\nSo a straight 4:1 is bad for me. I can afford to give up only 3 Brick for 1 Ore while still eking out a modest gain (since 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 < 37).\n\nBut let\u2019s tempt them a bit more. I will offer 3 Brick + 2 Wheat (total value 3\u00d724 + 2\u00d75 = 82) for 2 Ore (worth 74). To me that\u2019s a loss; instead let\u2019s try 3 Brick for 2 Ore (which Player 1 surely will never take). We meet at 3 Brick for 1 Ore (I still lose 35).\n\nA better middle ground is 3 Brick + 2 Sheep for 2 Ore:\nI lose 3\u00d724 + 2\u00d714 = 100, gain 2\u00d737 = 74 \u2192 net \u201326 (still bad).\n\nMust achieve net positive to me. So the correct ask is at least 3 Ore for 3 Brick plus whatever low-value stuff I\u2019m willing to move.\n\nOffer: I give 8 Wheat + 3 Brick \u2192 get 3 Ore.\nValue to me: \u20138\u00d75 \u20133\u00d724 = \u2013112, +3\u00d737 = +111 \u2192 net \u20131. Close.\n\nActually the minimum to break even, leveraging low-value Wheat:\n\nOffer 8 Wheat + 2 Brick (value 8\u00d75 + 2\u00d724 = 88) for 3 Ore (value 111) \u2013 net +23.
