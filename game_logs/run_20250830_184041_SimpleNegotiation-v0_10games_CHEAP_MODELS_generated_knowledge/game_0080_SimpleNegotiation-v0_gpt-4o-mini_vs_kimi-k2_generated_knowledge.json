Looking at the values:\n- Wheat (6) and Wood (8) are low-value, so I want to trade these away.\n- Ore (36) and Sheep (15) are high-value, so I want to acquire more of these.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat (21) and Wood (20), and relatively low Brick (10). I could offer some Wheat/Wood for Brick or Sheep/Ore.\n\nProposed trade:\nI will offer 4 Wheat and 3 Wood (total value: 4*6 + 3*8 = 24 + 24 = 48) in exchange for 2 Sheep (2*15 = 30) and 1 Ore (36). This totals 66 for me, which is a net gain of 18 (66 - 48 = 18).\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Sheep, 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Based on the current resources and trade offers, here's how Player 0 should respond:\n\n1. After accepting Player 1's last offer, Player 0 has gained 7 Brick and traded away 2 Ore and 1 Wood. \n\n2. Current resources after the trades:\n   - Wheat: 11\n   - Wood: 21 (22 - 1)\n   - Sheep: 23\n   - Brick: 25 (18 + 7)\n   - Ore: 15 (17 - 2)\n\n3. Player 1's new offer is: Offered items: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> Requested items: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore. \n\nLet's evaluate Player 0's response:\n\n- The value of Player 0's current Wheat (5 each) and Wood (9 each) suggests a total value contribution of 4 Wheat * 5 + 3 Wood * 9 = 20 + 27 = 47.\n- Player 0 would be giving away 2 Sheep (17 each = 34) and 1 Ore (36 each = 36), totaling a value of 34 + 36 = 70.\n- This trade would yield a net decrease in value for Player 0 (shown by total: -23 value).\n\nThus, Player 0 should respond to Player 1's offer with a denial. \n\nFinal action:\n\n[**Deny**]",
