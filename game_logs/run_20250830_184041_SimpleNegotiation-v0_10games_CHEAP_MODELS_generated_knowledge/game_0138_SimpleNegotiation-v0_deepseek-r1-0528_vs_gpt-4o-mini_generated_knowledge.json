Updated Resources:\n   - Wheat: 0 (reduce to zero since you cannot have negative)\n   - Wood: 15\n   - Sheep: 1\n   - Brick: 10\n   - Ore: 22\n\nConsidering Player 0's last trade offer of 3 Sheep and 2 Wood for 2 Ore, it's not possible for you to accept that given you only have 1 Sheep.\n\nLet's create a strategic offer since we need valuable resources. Noting the high value of Ore, we could consider offering some resources that we have in surplus. \n\n### New Trade Offer:\n- Offer 1 Wood, 3 Sheep for 4 Ore.\n- Format: [Offer: 1 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 4 Ore].\n\nLet's proceed:\n\n[Offer: 1 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 4 Ore]",

      "response": "After considering Player 1's offer to trade 1 Wood and 3 Sheep for 4 Ore, I've determined this trade is highly unfavorable. From my perspective, giving up Ore (valued at 37 each) for Wood (8) and Sheep (14) results in a significant net loss of value for me: specifically, trading 4 Ore (148 value) for resources worth only 50 total (1 Wood = 8, 3 Sheep = 42). \n\nTherefore, I cannot accept this deal. Instead, I propose a new offer that should be mutually beneficial. I'll trade 1 Brick (21 value) and 2 Sheep (28 value) for 2 Ore (74 value). This maintains a fair value exchange while allowing both of us to adjust our resources productively.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
