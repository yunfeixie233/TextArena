You want to trade in a way that maximizes the total value of your resources. \n\n### Trade Offer Strategy:\n\n1. **Trading Resources**: Consider trades that get you more valuable resources. For example, Brick and Ore are highly valued in your collection.\n  \n2. **Sample Trade**: \n   - Since you have a surplus of Sheep, you could offer a few along with Ore in exchange for Brick, which has a lower quantity in comparison to your other resources.\n\n### Proposed Trade Offer for Turn 1:\n- Offer: 4 Sheep and 1 Ore for 3 Brick\n- This impacts as follows:\n  - You're giving away resources of total value = (4 \u00d7 18) + (1 \u00d7 38) = 72 + 38 = 110\n  - You are acquiring resources worth = (3 \u00d7 29) = 87\n\nSince the resource exchange results in a net loss of 23 in value, let\u2019s consider a better proposal focused on other resources.\n\n### Better Trade Offer for Turn 1:\n- Offer: 3 Sheep and 2 Ore for 5 Brick\n- Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n  - Value given away = (3 \u00d7 18) + (2 \u00d7 38) = 54 + 76 = 130\n  - Value gained = (5 \u00d7 29) = 145\n\nThis proposal gives you a net value gain of 15.\n\n### Final Offer for Turn 1:\nI will proceed with:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep] \n\nLet\u2019s see how the opponent responds!",

      "response": "To evaluate the current situation and decide on my next action, I will first summarize my current resources after accepting trades:\n\n### Current Resources after Trades:\n- **Wheat**: 13 (Value: 5)\n- **Wood**: 20 - (2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 10) = 20 - 25 = -5 (Need to clarify total transacted)\n- **Sheep**: 24 - 3 - 2 = 19 (After accepting 3 Sheep for 1 Ore and 2 Sheep)\n- **Brick**: 0 + 2 (From trade with Player 1) = 2 (After accepting 3 Wood for 2 Brick)\n- **Ore**: 0 + 2 (From trades of 4 Wood and 6 Wood for 2 Ore and 3 Ore) = 5\n\nBased on this, I need to clarify the Wood count due to incorrect math above, but I will focus on what I currently hold:\n\n#### Action Options:\n1. I have 19 Sheep, 5 Ore, and 2 Brick.\n2. I don\u2019t have any Wood after the trades, which limits my trading options with Player 1 since they are offering Wood.\n\nBefore I make my next move, observing that Player 1 is currently proposing to trade Wood for Ore, it\u2019s important that I only accept trades that increase my total value.\n\n### Analysis of Player 1's Offer:\n- **Playing quantity versus value**: \n  - Current offer: 10 Wood for 5 Ore\n    - If I accept this offer, I will exchange 5 Ore for 10 Wood.\n    - My total resource count and the value increase must be justified. \n\n### Current Value of Resources:\n- Wheat: 13 x 5 = 65\n- Wood: 0 x 12 = 0 \n- Sheep: 19 x 18 = 342\n- Brick: 2 x 29 = 58\n- Ore: [After offering previously] 5  x 38 = 190\n\n### Total Current Value Calculation:\n- Total Value = 65 + 0 + 342 + 58 + 190 = 655\n\n### Next Move:\nWhile Player 1's offer of 10 Wood for 5 Ore could seem attractive due to immediate resource gain, I should analyze if I need to maintain my Ore resources. Therefore, given the situation, I will evaluate my upcoming moves.\n\nAt this moment, I want to counter offer Player 1 based on resources that balance the value:\n\n### Counter Offer to Player 1: \n**[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 5 Wood]** (If that aligns with your resource demands)\n\nThis exchange maintains the balance of resources and allows for future trades. \n\n#### Next Action:\n**Counter Offer**: \n```\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 5 Wood]\n```",
