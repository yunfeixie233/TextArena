Player 1 values Brick highly (rejected 6 Wheat for 6 Brick)\n2. Player 1 wants Ore (offered 7 Wheat for 1 Ore)\n3. Player 1 wants Wood (offered 3 Wheat for 2 Wood)\n\nGiven the current state (seems like turn 9 out of 10), I need to make a strategic offer. Based on their patterns:\n\n[Offer: 10 Sheep, 5 Wood -> 5 Brick, 2 Ore]",
