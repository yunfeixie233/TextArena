Ore is the highest, followed by Brick.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a trade offer based on the current situation and the goal to increase total value.\nI can offer some Wheat for Ore or Brick.\n\n## Step 4: Check if there's an opportunity to trade Wheat for a more valuable resource.\nOffering 4 Wheat for 1 Ore could be a good start, as it increases my Ore quantity.\n\nThe action I want to take is: [Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe response should be in the format: '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'",
