P0 just proposed giving {5 Wood, 3 Wheat} for {3 Brick, 1 Sheep} from P1.  \n   \u2013 Value lost by P0: 5\u00b79 wood + 3\u00b76 wheat = 63  \n   \u2013 Value gained by P0: 3\u00b720 brick + 1\u00b713 sheep = 73 \u2192 a net +10 for P0, but naturally P1 saw no reason to agree.  \n2. P1 refused and submitted no new offer of their own.\n\nBased on their refusal, I infer P1 probably wants more generous exchanges (better perceived value for them) or resources they value more highly.\n\nKey observations from the price list  \n- Current valuations for me (P0):  \n  Ore 38 >> Brick 20 >> Sheep 13 >> Wood 9 > Wheat 6.  \n- I still have a commodity surplus: 23 Wood and 6 Wheat (my two lowest-valued items) are still much larger than my need.  \n- My Ore stack is very valuable; I\u2019d prefer not to let any go unless the return is dramatically positive.\n\nWith one turn used, I have 9 left.  To begin increasing my holdings I need to show Player 1 a package that looks good to them while still improving my own value.\n\nNext plan  \n- Offer a clear value tilt toward Player 1 (at least +8 for them according to the numbers above) so they feel incentivised.  \n- Target their slightly-excess stock of Wood & Sheep since they already rejected Green/light-color swaps.  \n\nProposed opening:\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood \u2192 2 Brick, 3 Sheep]\n\nInternal check:  \n- P0 gives away 6\u00b76 + 4\u00b79 = 72 value.  \n- P0 receives 2\u00b720 + 3\u00b713 = 67 value.  \nThat tiny short-term loss (-5) is intentional to entice P1.  If P1 values wheat/wood more highly than I do (as is likely) this has a good chance of acceptance.  Getting Brick (my highest non-Ore target) is worth the small concession.",
