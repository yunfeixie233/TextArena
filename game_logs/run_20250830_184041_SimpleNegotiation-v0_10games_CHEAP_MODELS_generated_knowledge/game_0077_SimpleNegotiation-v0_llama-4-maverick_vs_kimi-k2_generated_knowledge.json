Given the values, Ore is the most valuable per unit, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\n### Turn 1 Analysis:\nLet's examine potential trades. I have a significant quantity of Brick, which is valuable. I could consider offering some Brick for Ore or Sheep, as they are also relatively valuable.\n\n### Potential Trade:\nI have 22 Brick, and while it's valuable, having more Ore or Sheep could be beneficial. Let's consider offering some Brick for Ore.\n\n### Action for Turn 1:\nSince I have a good amount of Brick and Ore is very valuable, I'll make an offer to see if I can get some Ore in exchange for Brick.\n\n`[Offer: 4 Brick -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis is a reasonable starting point. I'm offering 4 Brick (total value of 100) for 1 Ore (value of 36), which might not be attractive. Let's adjust the offer to be more appealing.\n\n`[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis offer gives away 2 Brick (value of 50) for 1 Ore (value of 36), which is still not very appealing to me but could be a starting negotiation point.\n\nLet's make the offer: \n`[Offer: 3 Brick, 1 Wood -> 2 Ore]`\n\nHere, I'm offering 3 Brick (value of 75) and 1 Wood (value of 8), totaling 83, for 2 Ore (value of 72). This is not a great deal for me, but it's a negotiation starting point.\n\nLet's see the opponent's response.\n\n### My Action:\n`[Offer: 3 Brick, 1 Wood -> 2 Ore]`",
