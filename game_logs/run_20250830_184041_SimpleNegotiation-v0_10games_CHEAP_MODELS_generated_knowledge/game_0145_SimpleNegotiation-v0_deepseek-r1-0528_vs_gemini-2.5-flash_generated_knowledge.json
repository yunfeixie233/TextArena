      "response": "After reviewing your offer, I've considered the value implications for my current resources. You're offering 10 Wheat, 6 Sheep, and 3 Ore in exchange for 5 Brick and 5 Wood. \n\nHere\u2019s my analysis:\n- **Current values per unit**:  \n  Wheat: 5, Wood: 12, Sheep: 18, Brick: 22, Ore: 40  \n- **Value of your offer**:  \n  (10 Wheat \u00d7 5) + (6 Sheep \u00d7 18) + (3 Ore \u00d7 40) = 50 + 108 + 120 = **278**  \n- **Value of my give-up**:  \n  (5 Brick \u00d7 22) + (5 Wood \u00d7 12) = 110 + 60 = **170**  \n- **Net gain for me**: 278 - 170 = **+108**  \n\nThis trade increases my total resource value significantly (from 992 to 1100). Since Wood and Brick are less valuable to me than Ore, and we\u2019re nearing the end of the game, I\u2019m willing to accept.  \n\nLet\u2019s proceed:  \n[Accept]",
