      "response": "As Player 0, I need to trade strategically to increase my total resource value. I currently have a lot of low-value Wheat and Wood, but I want to acquire high-value resources like Ore or Brick to boost my overall worth. At the same time, I cannot accept trades that cause a net value loss. After reviewing my resources, I propose a balanced offer that gives the other player a reason to trade while ensuring I gain value. \n\nI'll offer a trade that leverages my overabundance of low-value resources by requesting a smaller quantity of higher-value resources. Based on the value ratios, I calculate that giving 8 Wheat and 6 Wood (total value: 8*6 + 6*10 = 48 + 60 = 108) for 2 Ore (total value: 2*38 = 76) would result in a net loss for me, which is unacceptable. To avoid this, I'll aim for a more equitable distribution. Instead, I'll offer a mix that includes a request for Brick, which is high-value but not as scarce for me as Ore.\n\nMy offer: I'll give 10 Wheat (low value, I have 19) and 5 Wood (low value, I have 19) in exchange for 3 Brick (high value, you benefit by offloading some if you have excess). \n\n**Value analysis from my perspective:**\n- Giving: 10 Wheat * 6 = 60, 5 Wood * 10 = 50 \u2192 Total given = 110\n- Receiving: 3 Brick * 28 = 84\n- Net outcome for me: 84 - 110 = -26 (loss) \u2192 Unacceptable. I must adjust.\n\nTo ensure a small gain for me while making it appealing to you, I'll reduce the ask. Let's try 10 Wheat and 5 Wood for 4 Brick:\n- Giving: 110 (as above)\n- Receiving: 4 Brick * 28 = 112\n- Net gain for me: 112 - 110 = +2\n\nThis gives me a small increase (2 value units) while potentially freeing up surplus Brick for you if you have it. It also helps me reduce low-value clutter. If you have excess Brick or need Wheat/Wood for your own reasons (e.g., to complete a set for another trade), this could be mutually beneficial.\n\n**Final offer:**  \n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 4 Brick]\n\nLet me know if this works for you, or counteroffer! I'm open to discussion for a better deal that works for both of us.",
