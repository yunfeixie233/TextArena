Actually look again: the ONLY accepted deal after initial 5B\u21923O2W was when I accepted the mirror 7W2S\u21924O, which did NOT change my Brick at all. The only other accepted deal so far is the **first trade**, so Brick now is 25-5 = 20.)\n\nOre   11 (14-3+4 =15, THEN- 4 from the accepted mirror deal, so 11 total)\n\nSheep 15 (17 \u2013 2 when I accepted P1\u2019s mirror offer)\n\nWheat 29 (24 \u2013 2 in first trade gained 3 Mine, then +7 from the accepted P1 offer)\n\nWood  10  \n\nValues per unit \u2013 Wheat 5, Wood 12, Sheep 12, Brick 26, Ore 38  \n\nCurrent total value \u2248 (29*5)+(10*12)+(15*12)+(20*26)+(11*38)  \n= 145 + 120 + 180 + 520 + 418 = 1,383.\n\nOpponent just offered  \n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 4 Brick]\n\nValue to me: I lose 2 Ore and gain 4 Brick.  \n-2\u00d738 = -76. +4\u00d726 = +104.

This is indeed profitable because the absolute value rises (76 vs 104), and it smooths my resource mix slightly.\n\nTherefore I will immediately accept.\n\n[Accept]",
