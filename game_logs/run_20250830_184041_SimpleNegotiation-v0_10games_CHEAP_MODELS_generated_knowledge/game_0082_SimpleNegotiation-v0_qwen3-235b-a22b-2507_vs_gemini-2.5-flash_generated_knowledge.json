Player 0 also rejected their own offer of 10 Sheep, 5 Ore for 10 Brick, 5 Wheat.\n\nI want to increase the total value of my resources. My current total value is:\n10*6 + 12*10 + 19*17 + 10*28 + 24*38 = 60 + 120 + 323 + 280 + 912 = 1695.\n\nLooking at the rejected offers, Player 0 seems interested in Brick and Wheat, and they offered Sheep and Ore.\nMy last offer (5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 10 Sheep) was rejected.\n(5*6 + 5*10) = 30 + 50 = 80 value offered.\n(10*17) = 170 value requested.\nThis was a good offer for me.\n\nPlayer 0's offer (10 Sheep, 5 Ore -> 10 Brick, 5 Wheat) \n(10*17 + 5*38) = 170 + 190 = 360 value offered by Player 0.\n(10*28 + 5*6) = 280 + 30 = 310 value requested by Player 0.\nThis offer was not good for player 0, so I can see why they rejected it.\n\nLet's try to offer high value items for lower value items.\nI have plenty of Ore (24) and Sheep (19).\nPlayer 0 seems to prioritize Brick. I have 10 Brick.\nI want to increase my values, so I should try to trade for items that have higher values.\nOre is my highest value item. Wheat is the lowest.\n\nLet's offer a small amount of Ore for a higher value item, or some Brick.\nMaybe Player 0 wants to trade away Sheep since they offered it.\n\nI will try to offer something that benefits Player 0 while also increasing my value.\nLet's try to get more Brick, since it has a high value.\nI have plenty of Wheat. The value of Wheat is 6.\nI also have plenty of Wood. The value of Wood is 10.\n\nIf I offer 20 Wheat (value 120) for 5 Brick (value 140). This would be good for me. But I only have 10 Wheat.\nLet's offer something I have a lot of for something I need more of.\nI have a lot of Ore and Sheep. I have 10 Brick.\n\nLet's try offering some Ore for Brick.\nValue of 1 Ore is 38. Value of 1 Brick is 28.\nSo 1 Ore for 2 Brick would be (38 vs 56). That's good for me.\nBut maybe Player 0 doesn't want to give up that much Brick.\n\nLet's try getting rid of Wheat or Wood for some higher value items.\nI'll offer Wheat and Wood for Brick or Ore.\nHow about offering 5 Wheat (30) and 5 Wood (50) for 3 Brick (84)?\nThis gives me a slight advantage in value.\n\nLet's try to acquire more Ore or Brick.\nI have a significant amount of Sheep.\nIf I offer 5 Sheep (85) for 2 Ore (76). That's not great for me.\n\nLet's assume Player 0 is also trying to increase their total value.\nI should try to offer something appealing to them.\nThey offered Sheep and Ore. They wanted Brick and Wheat.\n\nSo they have a surplus of Sheep and Ore, and a deficit of Brick and Wheat.\nI have a surplus of Sheep and Ore. I have some Brick and Wheat.\n\nSince they seem to want Brick, perhaps I can trade some of my lower value items for Brick.\nI have 10 Wheat (6), 12 Wood (10).\n\nLet's try offering my lower value items (Wheat, Wood) for their higher value items (Brick, Ore).\nMy previous offer of 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 10 Sheep was rejected. (80 -> 170). This was good for me.\n\nLet's try to get Brick.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Brick]\nValue Offered: (5 * 6) + (5 * 10) = 30 + 50 = 80\nValue Requested: (3 * 28) = 84\nThis is a small gain for me (+4 value).
