      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, I will analyze my current resources and their associated values:\n\n- Wheat: Qty = 20, Value = 5\n- Wood: Qty = 11, Value = 11\n- Sheep: Qty = 18, Value = 17\n- Brick: Qty = 15, Value = 21\n- Ore: Qty = 12, Value = 36\n\nMy total value is calculated as follows:\n- Total Value = (20 * 5) + (11 * 11) + (18 * 17) + (15 * 21) + (12 * 36)\n- Total Value = 100 + 121 + 306 + 315 + 432 = 1274\n\n### Strategic Consideration\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I need to strategically decide which resources to trade and which to acquire. Resources with higher values are generally more desirable. My highest value resources are Ore (Value = 36) and Sheep/Brick (Values = 17 and 21, respectively). I should aim to maintain or increase my holdings in these high-value resources while potentially trading away lower-value resources.\n\n### Initial Offer\n\nUpon examining my resources, I notice that Wheat has the lowest value per unit (Value = 5). Trading Wheat for other resources that have a higher value could be beneficial. \n\nLet's consider making an initial offer that trades some Wheat for a resource that could potentially increase my total value. Since Ore is my most valuable resource per unit, I should be cautious about trading it away. However, I can consider trading some of my lower-value resources for more Ore or maintaining my high-value resources.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nI'll start by offering to trade some Wheat for Ore, as Ore is my most valuable resource and I believe acquiring more could be beneficial, but I actually have Ore, so I'll look to trade Wheat for something else valuable.\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]' is a potential offer because Brick is a relatively high-value resource, and trading low-value Wheat for it could be beneficial.\n\nHowever, let's refine this thought: given that Brick is already one of my resources and I have a considerable quantity of it, trading for another Brick might not be the most optimal unless the terms are very favorable.\n\nA more balanced initial offer could involve trading Wheat for Wood, as both are relatively lower in value compared to the other resources I have.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 2 Wood]' doesn't seem to improve my total value significantly since both Wheat and Wood are among the lower-value resources.\n\nLet's directly offer for a higher-value resource by giving away some Wheat:\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis offer directly aims to increase my total value by acquiring more of the highest-value resource (Ore) by giving away some of the lowest-value resource (Wheat).\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' is my action for Turn 1.\n\nLet's see the response from my opponent.",

Let's consider offering Wheat for Ore or Brick since they are more valuable.\n\n## Step 6: Determine a reasonable trade.\nGiven that I already have a significant amount of Ore, trading Wheat for Brick might be more beneficial as Brick is the second most valuable resource I don't have excessively compared to Ore.\n\n## Step 7: Make a trade offer based on the current situation and the remaining turns.\nLet's offer 4 Wheat for 1 Brick.

      "response": "Let's analyze the current situation and make a decision for the next turn.\n\n### Current Resources and Values\n\nAfter the trades so far, let's update the resources and their values.\n\nInitially:\n- Wheat: 20 * 5 = 100\n- Wood: 11 * 11 = 121\n- Sheep: 18 * 17 = 306\n- Brick: 15 * 21 = 315\n- Ore: 12 * 36 = 432\n\nTotal initial value = 100 + 121 + 306 + 315 + 432 = 1274\n\nAfter trades:\n1. Offered 5 Wheat for 1 Brick: \n   - Wheat: 20 - 5 = 15, Value: 15 * 5 = 75\n   - Brick: 15 + 1 = 16, Value: 16 * 21 = 336\n   Total value after 1st trade = 1274 - 25 + 21 = 1270\n\n2. Traded 4 Wood for 1 Ore with Player 1:\n   - Wood: 11 - 4 = 7, Value: 7 * 11 = 77\n   - Ore: 12 + 1 = 13, Value: 13 * 36 = 468\n   Total value after 2nd trade = 1270 - 44 + 36 = 1262\n\n3. Traded 3 Wheat for 1 Ore with Player 1:\n   - Wheat: 15 - 3 = 12, Value: 12 * 5 = 60\n   - Ore: 13 + 1 = 14, Value: 14 * 36 = 504\n   Total value after 3rd trade = 1262 - 15 + 36 = 1283\n\nCurrent resources and values:\n- Wheat: 12, Value: 60\n- Wood: 7, Value: 77\n- Sheep: 18, Value: 306\n- Brick: 16, Value: 336\n- Ore: 14, Value: 504\n\nTotal current value = 60 + 77 + 306 + 336 + 504 = 1283\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe total value of resources has increased from 1274 to 1283 after the trades. We need to continue making strategic trades to increase this value further.\n\n### Possible Trades\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. **Sheep for Brick or Ore**: We have a good quantity of Sheep, and trading them for either Brick or Ore could be beneficial since Ore is highly valued and Brick is moderately valued.\n\n2. **Wheat for Other Resources**: We still have Wheat, and trading it for higher-value resources like Ore or Brick could be a good strategy.\n\n3. **Wood for Ore**: Since we've already traded some Wood for Ore and it was beneficial, we might consider doing it again if the offer is reasonable.\n\n### Next Move\n\nLet's make an offer. We can offer 2 Sheep for 1 Ore. This is because Sheep are valued at 17 each, and Ore is valued at 36. So, offering 2 Sheep (total value of 34) for 1 Ore (value of 36) is a good deal as it increases our total value.\n\n`[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThe response should be in the format: `[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`",
