This is a negative trade for me (-15 value). I should deny this.\n\nI have a significant amount of Sheep and Wood, which have lower individual values. Ore and Brick have higher values, and I have a decent amount of Brick. I want to acquire more high-value resources (Ore, Brick) by trading away low-value resources (Sheep, Wheat, Wood) or by making deals where the value received is higher than the value given.\n\nPlayer 0 has previously offered Wheat and Brick, suggesting they might have those. Their previous offers often seem to try and acquire Sheep or Wheat from me.\n\nI have a decent amount of Sheep and a very high value on Ore. I should continue to try and convert my low-value resources into high-value resources.\n\nMy previous successful trade helped me. I will continue to target Ore.\n\nI have 21 Sheep. Perhaps I can offer more Sheep, or a combination of Sheep and Wood, for some Ore or Brick.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again. If 3 Sheep was good for 1 Ore, what if I offer more Sheep for more Ore?\n\nConsider asking for Brick. If I trade 3 Sheep for Brick, what's a good ratio?\nBrick value is 28. Sheep value is 12.\n2 Sheep (24) for 1 Brick (28) is a good trade for me (+4).\n3 Sheep (36) for 1 Brick (28) is a bad trade for me (-8).\n\nI should check what Player 0 might need. They've previously offered Ore and Brick for Sheep and Wheat. This means they are interested in Sheep and Wheat.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep. I'll propose a trade that converts multiple Sheep into something valuable.\n\nLet's try offering two low-value items for one high-value item.\nWhat about Sheep and Wood for Ore or Brick?\n\nSheep (12) + Wood (11) = 23.\nThis is less than Brick (28) or Ore (39).\nSo, 1 Sheep + 1 Wood for 1 Brick would be a good trade for me (+5).\n1 Sheep + 1 Wood for 1 Ore would be even better for me (+16).\n\nLet's offer a small amount of my lower value resources for one of their higher value resources.\nI have plenty of Sheep and Wood.\n\nI will offer a reasonable amount for a desirable item. My last trade was 3 Sheep for 1 Ore. Player 0 accepted. That was good for me.\n\nPlayer 0 just offered 1 Ore for 2 Sheep. This suggests they have Ore and want Sheep. This is good information.\nI will counter-offer leveraging this. I want their Ore and they want my Sheep.\n\nI have 21 Sheep.\nThey offered (1 Ore -> 2 Sheep) Value: (39 -> 24). Bad for me.\nMy previous offer (3 Sheep -> 1 Ore) Value: (36 -> 39). Good for me.\n\nThis means there's a range where we can meet.\nI want to get Ore. They seem to want Sheep.\n\nI will try to make another good trade for myself.\nIf they offered 1 Ore for 2 Sheep, maybe they will accept 4 Sheep for 1 Ore.\nValue of 4 Sheep: 4*12 = 48.\nValue of 1 Ore: 39.\nThis would be a loss of 9 for me. Not acceptable.\n\nWhat about 3 Sheep for 1 Ore again?\nOr perhaps something else they might want in addition to Sheep?\nMaybe 2 Sheep + 1 Wood for 1 Ore?\n(2*12) + 11 = 24 + 11 = 35.\nFor 1 Ore (39). This is a good trade for me (+4).\nI have plenty of Wood (18) and Sheep (21).\n\nLet's try this. It's similar to my previous good trade (3 Sheep for 1 Ore), but uses some wood.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
