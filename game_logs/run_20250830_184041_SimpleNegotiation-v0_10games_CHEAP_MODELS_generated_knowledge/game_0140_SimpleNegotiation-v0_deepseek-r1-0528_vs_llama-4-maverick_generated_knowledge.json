I have 7 Brick, so receiving 3 Brick would increase my Brick quantity.\n\nTo counter or potentially improve this offer, I could make a counteroffer. One possible counteroffer could involve requesting more value or adjusting the quantities to be more favorable.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer that could be more balanced. For instance, I could propose:\n'[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]' \nThis means I give 1 Ore (value = 35) and get 2 Brick (total value = 40), which is a bit more balanced.\n\nHowever, considering the original offer and the fact that I have a surplus of Sheep relative to other resources and not as much Ore relative to the demand, I'll think about making a more strategic offer or accepting/denying the current offer.\n\nThe current offer is not very favorable, so I might want to deny it and potentially make a different offer or wait for another turn to see what other offers come in.\n\nLet's deny the current offer and make a more strategic offer: \n'[Deny]'\n'[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 2 Ore]'\n\nThis action involves denying the current offer and making a new one that could be more appealing or beneficial. It involves giving up 2 Sheep (value = 36) and 1 Brick (value = 20), totaling 56, in exchange for 2 Ore (value = 70), which is a gain.\n\nThe response will be:\n'[Deny][Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 2 Ore]'",

Let's propose a counteroffer:\n- Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore\n  - Value given: 4 * 10 = 40\n  - Value received: 1 * 35 = 35\n  - This is not favorable due to the negative net value change.\n\nHowever, considering the available resources and the fact that Ore is highly valued, let's think about other possibilities:\n- **[Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Brick]**: This involves giving up Sheep (Value: 18) and Wheat (Value: 10), total = 28, for 2 Brick (Value: 40), which is a gain.\n\nLet's examine the values:\n- Giving: 1 Sheep (18) + 2 Wheat (10) = 28\n- Receiving: 2 Brick = 40\n- Net gain = 12\n\nThis seems like a reasonable trade.\n\nAction: [Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\n\nThus, the response is: [Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",

I need to think about what I have and what I need, and try to make a trade that will increase my total value.\n\nI notice that I have a relatively high quantity of Sheep and a decent quantity of Wheat, but their values are not as high as Ore or Brick. I have gained Brick in the last trade and lost Ore. Considering my current resources, I can think of making an offer that involves giving away some Sheep or Wheat for something more valuable.\n\nOne potential offer could be: [Offer:2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]. \n\nSo, my action for this turn will be: [Offer:2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
