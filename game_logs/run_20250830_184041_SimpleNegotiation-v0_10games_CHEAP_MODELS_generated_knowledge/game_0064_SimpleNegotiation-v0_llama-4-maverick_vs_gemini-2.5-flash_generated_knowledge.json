      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nTo effectively play the Negotiation Game, let's first analyze the current state of our resources and their values.\n\n#### Current Resources and Values\n\n- Wheat: Qty = 14, Value = 6\n- Wood: Qty = 7, Value = 11\n- Sheep: Qty = 5, Value = 17\n- Brick: Qty = 17, Value = 26\n- Ore: Qty = 19, Value = 39\n\n#### Total Value Calculation\n\nTo understand our starting position, we need to calculate the total value of our resources.\n\n1. Wheat: 14 * 6 = 84\n2. Wood: 7 * 11 = 77\n3. Sheep: 5 * 17 = 85\n4. Brick: 17 * 26 = 442\n5. Ore: 19 * 39 = 741\n\nTotal Value = 84 + 77 + 85 + 442 + 741 = 1429\n\n#### Strategy\n\nOur goal is to increase the total value of our resources through trading. To do this effectively, we should:\n1. Identify resources that are likely to be undervalued in our portfolio.\n2. Identify resources that are highly valued.\n3. Make offers that exchange lower-value resources (or those we have in abundance relative to their value) for higher-value resources.\n\n#### Initial Observation\n\n- Ore is the most valuable resource we have, followed by Brick.\n- Wheat is the least valuable resource.\n\n#### Potential Trade\n\nTo start, we could consider offering some of our less valuable resources in exchange for more valuable ones. Since Wheat is the least valuable and we have a considerable quantity of it, it might be a good starting point for a trade.\n\n### Initial Trade Offer\n\nLet's consider making an offer that involves Wheat. We need to think about what we can reasonably request in return. Given that Ore is our most valuable resource, we should be cautious about trading it away. However, we can start by offering Wheat for something slightly more valuable.\n\n### Action\n\nLet's make an initial offer: `[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`. This offer is a test to see how the opponent values Wheat relative to Ore. We are offering a significant quantity of Wheat (half of what we have) for a relatively small amount of Ore (compared to what we already possess).\n\nHowever, upon further consideration, we realize that offering Wheat for Ore might not be the most strategic since Ore is very valuable. Let's adjust our strategy to offer something that might be more reasonable.\n\n### Alternative Action\n\nLet's offer some Wheat for Wood: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Wood]`. This exchange could potentially be beneficial if the opponent values Wheat more than we do relative to Wood.\n\n### Response\n\nWe will wait for the opponent's response to our offer. If they accept, we'll proceed with the trade. If they deny it, we'll reassess and potentially make a new offer or consider their counteroffer if they made one.\n\n### First Turn Action\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Wood]`\n\nLet's see how the opponent responds.",

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the current situation and the offer made by Player 1.\n\nCurrent Resources and Values for Player 0:\n- Wheat: 14 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 7 (Value: 11)\n- Sheep: 5 (Value: 17)\n- Brick: 17 (Value: 26)\n- Ore: 19 (Value: 39)\n\nPlayer 1's Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore\n\nLet's evaluate the offer:\n- Player 0 is being offered 5 Wheat in exchange for 1 Ore.\n- The value of 5 Wheat = 5 * 6 = 30\n- The value of 1 Ore = 1 * 39 = 39\n\nSince 30 (value of 5 Wheat) is less than 39 (value of 1 Ore), accepting this offer would decrease the total value of Player 0's resources.\n\nHowever, let's consider the opposite trade (what Player 0 initially offered):\n- Player 0 offered 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore\n- The value of 7 Wheat = 7 * 6 = 42\n- This is still more than the value of 1 Ore (39), so it was correctly rejected by Player 1.\n\nLet's think about making a counteroffer or a new offer that could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 1: Evaluate the resources and their values.\nWe need to identify which resources we can spare and which are valuable to us.\n\n## Step 2: Consider potential trades.\nTo increase the total value, we should look for trades where we give away resources of lower value and receive resources of higher value.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze possible trades based on the current resources.\n- We have a lot of Wheat (14), Brick (17), and Ore (19). \n- Wood (7) and Sheep (5) are less in quantity.\n\n## Step 4: Think about a beneficial trade.\nSince Ore is very valuable and we already have a lot of it, giving away some Wheat (less valuable) for something more valuable could be a good strategy. However, we need to ensure the trade is beneficial.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a new offer based on the analysis.\nLet's consider offering Wheat for a resource that is more valuable than Wheat but perhaps less abundant or valuable than Ore. For example, offering Wheat for Brick or Sheep could be considered, but we need to check if it's beneficial.\n\n## Step 6: Propose a new trade.\nOne potential trade could be offering Wheat for Sheep because Sheep is more valuable than Wheat. \n- For example: Offer 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep\n- Value of 4 Wheat = 4 * 6 = 24\n- Value of 1 Sheep = 1 * 17 = 17\nThis trade is not beneficial as it stands because 24 (Wheat) is greater than 17 (Sheep).\n\n## Step 7: Adjust the proposal to make it more attractive.\nLet's directly consider making an offer that is more likely to be accepted and is beneficial or at least less costly.\n\n## Step 8: Consider an alternative trade that could be beneficial.\nLet's analyze giving away Wheat for Ore again or other resources, or think about other combinations.\n\n## Step 9: Decide on a counteroffer or a new offer.\nLet's directly make a new offer: '[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep]' is not a valid consideration since we're not sure what Player 1 has. However, we can think about: '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the value of the proposed trade.\n- For '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]': \n  - Value of 3 Wheat = 3 * 6 = 18\n  - Value of 1 Sheep = 1 * 17 = 17\nThis trade is slightly unfavorable because 18 is greater than 17.\n\n## Step 11: Finalize the decision.\nSince the last offer from Player 1 was not in our favor, and our initial offer was rejected, let's think about a trade that is more balanced or beneficial.\n\nLet's directly formulate a response:\nGiven that Player 1 made an offer that wasn't in our favor, and considering our resources, we could make a new offer that is potentially more beneficial.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]}$",

This trade is not very favorable since it results in a net gain of -1.\n\nLet's reassess the values and consider making a new offer. \n\nSince Ore is very valuable and we are rich in Wheat, let's try to negotiate a better deal for Ore, keeping in mind that our last rejection was for 5 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n\n**New Offer:** Considering the previous rejection for 5 Wheat for 1 Ore and the high value of Ore, we might need to adjust our offer slightly.

I notice that I have a very low quantity of Wheat left, so I should avoid offering it. I can try to offer some Brick (Value: 26) or Wood (Value: 11) to get Sheep (Value: 17) or Ore (Value: 39).\n\nConsidering my resources and the goal to increase total value, I can make a new offer. I will offer 2 Wood (Value: 22) to request 1 Ore (Value: 39). This trade increases my total value.\n\nMy new offer: [Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nSo, my response is: [Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
