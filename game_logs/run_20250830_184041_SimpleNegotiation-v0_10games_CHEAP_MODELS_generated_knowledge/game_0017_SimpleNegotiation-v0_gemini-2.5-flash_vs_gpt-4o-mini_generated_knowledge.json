Player 1 may want to increase the total value of resources. To achieve this, Player 1 needs to consider how to best leverage their remaining resources, particularly focusing on maximizing value from Wheat, Wood, Brick, and Ore.\n\nSince the game has progressed, here is my next offer to Player 0:\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Brick -> 2 Ore]\n\nThis offer leverages what is available and seeks to return to a higher Ore count, which has significant value.",
