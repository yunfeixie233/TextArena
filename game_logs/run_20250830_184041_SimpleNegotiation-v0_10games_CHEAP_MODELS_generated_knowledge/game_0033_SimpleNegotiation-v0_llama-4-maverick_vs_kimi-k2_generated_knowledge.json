      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the current state of resources and the history of trades.\n\nInitially, the resources and their values were:\n+ [Wheat] Qty:20 Value:5\n+ [Wood] Qty:20 Value:8\n+ [Sheep] Qty:20 Value:16\n+ [Brick] Qty:6 Value:20\n+ [Ore] Qty:12 Value:34\n\nThe history of trades is as follows:\n1. Player0 offered 2 Sheep for 2 Brick, and Player1 accepted.\n   - After this trade: \n     - [Sheep] Qty:20 - 2 = 18\n     - [Brick] Qty:6 + 2 = 8\n2. Player0 offered 4 Wood for 1 Ore, and Player1 rejected.\n3. Player1 offered 3 Sheep for 1 Brick, and Player0 accepted.\n   - After this trade:\n     - [Sheep] Qty:18 + 3 = 21\n     - [Brick] Qty:8 + 1 = 9\n4. Player1 offered 2 Wood for 1 Brick, and Player0 rejected.\n5. Player0 offered 5 Wood for 2 Ore, and Player1 rejected.\n\nLet's update the quantities based on the trades:\n- [Wheat] Qty:20\n- [Wood] Qty:20 - 4 (first offer) - 5 (second offer) = 20 - 9 = 11\n- [Sheep] Qty:21\n- [Brick] Qty:9\n- [Ore] Qty:12\n\nCurrent quantities and values:\n- [Wheat] Qty:20 Value:5\n- [Wood] Qty:11 Value:8\n- [Sheep] Qty:21 Value:16\n- [Brick] Qty:9 Value:20\n- [Ore] Qty:12 Value:34\n\nTo maximize the total value, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given the current state and the history of trades, it seems that Ore (Value:34) is the most valuable resource, followed by Brick (Value:20), then Sheep (Value:16), Wood (Value:8), and Wheat (Value:5).\n\nSince the last offer made by Player0 (5 Wood for 2 Ore) was rejected, we should consider alternative trades that could be more appealing to Player1. \n\nOne potential trade could involve offering resources that are not as valuable to us but could be more valuable to Player1 in exchange for Ore or Brick.\n\n## Step 1: Determine the current state of resources.\nWe have: \n- [Wheat] Qty:20\n- [Wood] Qty:11\n- [Sheep] Qty:21\n- [Brick] Qty:9\n- [Ore] Qty:12\n\n## Step 2: Identify potential trades based on value.\nTo increase total value, we should look to acquire Ore or Brick if possible, as they are the most valuable.\n\n## Step 3: Consider a new trade offer.\nLet's think about offering Wheat (the least valuable resource) or Wood for Ore or Brick.\n\n## Step 4: Propose a trade.\nOffering 5 Wheat for 1 Ore could be a good start since Wheat is the least valuable resource, and Ore is the most valuable. \nThe value exchange is: 5 * 5 = 25 (for Wheat) vs. 1 * 34 = 34 (for Ore), which is a gain.\n\n## Step 5: Format the proposed trade according to the game's rules.\n[Offer:5 Wheat,0 ->1 Ore,0] is not the correct format; instead, we should directly specify the resources being traded. So, the correct format for the trade \"5 Wheat for 1 Ore\" is: [Offer:5 Wheat ->1 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer:5 Wheat ->1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Current Resources and Values\n\nAfter the last turn, let's review the current state of resources and values for Player 0:\n\n- Initial Resources and Values:\n  - [Wheat]   Qty: 20   Value: 5\n  - [Wood]    Qty: 20   Value: 8\n  - [Sheep]   Qty: 20   Value: 16\n  - [Brick]   Qty: 6    Value: 20\n  - [Ore]     Qty: 12   Value: 34\n\n- Changes Due to Trades:\n  1.

Offered 5 Wood for 2 Ore (rejected, no change).\n  5. Offered 5 Wheat for 1 Ore (accepted):\n     - [Wheat] decreased by 5, [Ore] increased by 1.\n     - New Qty: [Wheat] = 15, [Ore] = 13.\n\n- Current Resources and Values:\n  - [Wheat]   Qty: 15   Value: 5\n  - [Wood]    Qty: 20   Value: 8\n  - [Sheep]   Qty: 21   Value: 16\n  - [Brick]   Qty: 7    Value: 20\n  - [Ore]     Qty: 13   Value: 34\n\n### Next Action\n\nTo decide the next action, we should evaluate the current portfolio and consider potential trades that could increase the total value.\n\n1. **Evaluation of Current Portfolio:**\n   - Total Value = (15*5) + (20*8) + (21*16) + (7*20) + (13*34)\n   - Total Value = 75 + 160 + 336 + 140 + 442 = 1153\n\n2. **Potential Trades:**\n   - We should look for opportunities to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but potentially useful in future trades.\n\n3. **Proposed Trade:**\n   - Considering the values, Ore (34) is the most valuable. We could offer resources to gain more Ore if possible.\n   - Let's examine if we can offer something for Ore. We have Wheat (5), Wood (8), Sheep (16), and Brick (20). \n   - A potential trade could involve offering a less valuable resource or a combination that is still considered a good deal by the opponent.\n\n4. **Action:**\n   - Since Player 1 made no new offer last turn, we should make a new offer.\n   - Let's propose a trade: Offer 4 Brick (4*20 = 80) for 2 Ore (2*34 = 68). Although this seems to be a loss, having more Ore could be strategic. However, it's not a good trade in terms of immediate value.\n   - A better trade could be: Offer 3 Sheep (3*16 = 48) for 1 Ore (1*34 = 34). This is still not ideal but less unfavorable.\n   - A more balanced trade could be considered, but given the last successful trade (5 Wheat for 1 Ore), let's try something similar or slightly more valuable.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nLet's make a trade offer: `[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]`.\n\n- This translates to: `[Offer: 10 Wheat, 0 Other Resources -> 2 Ore, 0 Other Resources]`\n- In the required format: `[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]`\n\n### Response\n\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]`.",
