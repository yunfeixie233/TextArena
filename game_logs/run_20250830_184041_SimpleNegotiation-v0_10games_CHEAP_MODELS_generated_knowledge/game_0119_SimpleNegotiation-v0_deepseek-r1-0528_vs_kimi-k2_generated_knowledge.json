      "response": "[Accept]  \n*(After reviewing the trade parameters: Receiving 8 Brick (valued at 184) for 11 Sheep (valued at 132) results in a net gain of +52 to my total resource value. This trade leverages the high valuation of Brick (23) against Sheep (12) and aligns with my strategy to increase overall holdings by exchanging lower-value resources for higher-yield ones. With no immediate risk to critical stockpiles and limited turns remaining, accepting secures guaranteed profit.)*",
