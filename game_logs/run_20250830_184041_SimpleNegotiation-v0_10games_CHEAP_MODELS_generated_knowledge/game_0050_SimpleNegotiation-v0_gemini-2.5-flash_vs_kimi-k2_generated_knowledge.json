Conclusion: I now have Sheep 0 (not 6).  \n(Therefore my final update is: Sheep 6 \u2013 10 + 0 = \u20134, so effectively 0.)\n\nSo my current stock is:  \nWheat 19, Wood 9, Sheep 0, Brick 18, Ore 13.\n\nI currently have 0 Sheep, which makes their repeated 10-Wood-for-5-Ore offers irrelevant to me, because five Ore is a lot to pay for Wood whose value per unit is 10, and I only lose value.\n\nMy goal is always to finish every trade with higher total value than before, so I will propose an offer that is small, balanced, and gives me something I lack at a good rate.\n\nI need Sheep urgently, and I have plenty of Brick and Wheat. Wood would also be handy, though I already own it. I\u2019ll go for the simplest move: try to convert 2 excess Brick (21 value each) into 3 missing Sheep (12 value each). For me the value change is: \u20132 Brick (\u201342) vs +3 Sheep (+36) \u2192 net \u20136, so strictly worse than \u201cbreak-even.\u201d However, since Brick is currently bulky and Sheep is scarce, I\u2019ll try to offset the loss by also receiving 1 Wood. That would be: \u20132 Brick (\u201342) vs +3 Sheep (+36) +1 Wood (+10) \u2192 net +4. That looks profitable for me and still attractive for them, because they are being asked to give up only 3 Sheep (36 value) while receiving 2 Brick (42 value) and paying 1 Wood (10) on top of it \u2014 for them it is a loss of 4. We can call it an \u201ceven\u201d day-6 deal since they repeatedly declined to negotiate earlier, and 4 value is merely the price of doing business.\n\nSo here\u2019s my attempt:\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 3 Sheep, 1 Wood]",
