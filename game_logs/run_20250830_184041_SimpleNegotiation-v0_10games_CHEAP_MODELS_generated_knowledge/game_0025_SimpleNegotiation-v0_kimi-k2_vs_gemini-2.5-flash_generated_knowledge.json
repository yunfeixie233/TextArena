Brick is worth 28 each, and Wood is worth 12 each, so 5 Wood is worth 60 (12 * 5). This is a bad trade for me (losing 28 value for 60 value is good, but I don\u2019t need Wood worse, and Brick is more valuable).\n\n3. **My Offers**: My previous offer was 9 Wood for 5 Sheep, 4 Ore. This was rejected. possibly because Player 1 values Sheep or Ore more than I do. I need to find a trade where both sides see value.\n\n4. **Potential Trades**: \n   - Player 1 seems to have excess Wood (offering Wood repeatedly). I do not value Wood highly (12), so trading my higher-value resources for Wood is unwise. Instead, I might offer Wood for other resources if I can get a better ratio.\n   - I could try to convert some of my Brick or Ore (high value for me) into Sheep or Wood, but only if the trade improves my total value.\n\n5. **Smart Trade Proposal**: Player 1 seems to want Brick and is offering Wood. I can leverage this:\n   - 1 Brick is worth 28. If I trade 2 Brick (56 value) for 5 Wood (60 value), I gain 4 value. Player 1 might accept this since they seem to value Brick highly.\n   - Alternatively, I could ask for Sheep or Ore in a way that increases my value.\n\n6. **Final Decision**: I\u2019ll propose trading 2 Brick for 5 Wood and 2 Sheep. This gives me 5 Wood (60 value) + 2 Sheep (28 value) = 88 total for 2 Brick (56 value), netting +32 value.
