      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, let's analyze the initial state of my resources and their values:\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 23, Value: 6\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 5, Value: 12\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 20, Value: 15\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 22, Value: 27\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 14, Value: 37\n\nThe total value of my current resources is calculated as follows:\n- Total Value = (23 * 6) + (5 * 12) + (20 * 15) + (22 * 27) + (14 * 37)\n- Total Value = 138 + 60 + 300 + 594 + 518 = 1610\n\n### Negotiation Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or at least maintain the value while gaining a quantity that could be beneficial in future trades.\n\n### Initial Offer\n\nObserving the values, **[Ore]** has the highest value per unit (37), and **[Brick]** is the second-highest (27). My strategy could involve maintaining or increasing the quantity of these high-value resources.\n\nLet's start by making an offer. I have a considerable quantity of **[Sheep]** (Value: 15) and some **[Wood]** (Value: 12), which are relatively lower in value compared to **[Ore]** and **[Brick]**. \n\nI will offer **[3 Sheep]** (Value: 3*15 = 45) and **[2 Wood]** (Value: 2*12 = 24), totaling a value of 69, in exchange for **[1 Ore]** (Value: 37) and **[2 Brick]** (Value: 2*27 = 54), totaling a value of 91. This trade increases my total value by 22.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 2 Brick]`\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis initial offer is designed to gain higher-value resources (**[Ore]** and **[Brick]**) in exchange for relatively lower-value resources (**[Sheep]** and **[Wood]**), thus potentially increasing the total value of my resources.\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response and adjust our strategy accordingly.",

We can try to get rid of some Wheat (Value: 6) for other resources if possible.\n2. We can try to accumulate more of the higher-value resources like Ore (Value: 37), Brick (Value: 27), or Sheep (Value: 15) by trading our lower-value resources.\n\nConsidering the values, a potential trade could involve offering some Wheat and/or Wood for more valuable resources.\n\nLet's make an offer to trade 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep. The rationale is to get more valuable resources (Ore and Sheep) in exchange for less valuable ones (Wood and Wheat).\n\nThe action in the required format is: \n[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]\n\nLet's send this offer to Player 1.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]",
