      "response": "I am Player 0.\nMy current resources are:\n  - 6 Wheat (Value: 5)\n  - 8 Wood (Value: 8)\n  - 21 Sheep (Value: 14)\n  - 13 Brick (Value: 21)\n  - 11 Ore (Value: 33)\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources.\n\nI will start by making an offer that benefits me based on the value of resources. I have a lot of Sheep, and they have a relatively low value compared to Brick or Ore. I also have a good amount of Ore.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of my current resources:\nWheat: 6 * 5 = 30\nWood: 8 * 8 = 64\nSheep: 21 * 14 = 294\nBrick: 13 * 21 = 273\nOre: 11 * 33 = 363\nTotal Value: 30 + 64 + 294 + 273 + 363 = 1024\n\nI want to increase my valuable resources like Brick and Ore, potentially by trading away less valuable Sheep or Wood.\n\nOffer: I will offer some Sheep and request Brick.\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\nValue Offered: 5 * 14 = 70\nValue Requested: 2 * 21 = 42\nThis offer is not good for me. I need to make an offer where the value of requested items is higher.\n\nLet's try to trade Sheep for Ore. My Sheep value is 14, Ore is 33.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue Offered: 3 * 14 = 42\nValue Requested: 1 * 33 = 33\nThis is also not good for me.\n\nI need to be careful with the value exchange. My goal is to increase my *total* value. So, I should aim for offers where I receive more value than I give.\n\nLet's try to get more high-value resources. I have a lot of Sheep and a decent amount of Wood.\nI want more Ore or Brick.\n\nConsider trading away 5 Sheep (value 70).\nWhat can I get for 70 value?\n1 Ore is 33. So maybe 2 Ore (66).\nSo offering 5 Sheep for 2 Ore looks like a slight loss for me in terms of direct value, but I need to consider strategic play for the game.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix? Maybe Sheep and Wood for Ore.\nLet's try to acquire more Ore.\nI have plenty of Sheep.\n[Offer: 7 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\nValue Offered: 7 * 14 = 98\nValue Requested: 3 * 33 = 99\nThis is a good offer for me. I gain 1 value.\n\n[Offer: 7 Sheep -> 3 Ore]",
