Try to accumulate more Brick.\n2. **Trade Excess Wheat:** 24 Wheat is more than needed; can spare some for high-value trades.\n3. **Avoid Overtrading Ore:** Ore is very high-value (35). Only trade if getting excellent returns.\n\n### Next Move:\nLooking at Player 1's preferences (they accepted the Ore trade but not the Wheat/Sheep offer), they seem to value Ore highly. \n\nPossible Offer:\n- Offer Wheat and/or Sheep for Brick or more Ore.
