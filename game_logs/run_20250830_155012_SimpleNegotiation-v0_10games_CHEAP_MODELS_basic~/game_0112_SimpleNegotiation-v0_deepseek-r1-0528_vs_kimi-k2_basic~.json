Trading it away for higher value resources would increase my total.\n- Wood (12 qty, value 11 each) is moderate value, but I have enough to spare some. Trading it for high-value Brick could be beneficial.\n- Brick (6 qty, value 20 each) is high value for me, and acquiring more would significantly increase my total value. Player 1 has demonstrated willingness to trade Brick in the past.\n- Ore (20 qty, value 39 each) is my highest value resource, so I want to retain it unless a very favorable trade arises.\n\nTo increase my total value, I should focus on trading lower or moderate value resources for Brick. From Player 1's behavior, offering Wood for Brick might be more acceptable than Sheep or Ore. Therefore, I will propose a trade using Wood: offering 3 Wood for 2 Brick. This gives me a net gain of +7 in value (giving 33, receiving 40) while potentially appealing to Player 1 if they value Wood higher or Brick lower.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]",
