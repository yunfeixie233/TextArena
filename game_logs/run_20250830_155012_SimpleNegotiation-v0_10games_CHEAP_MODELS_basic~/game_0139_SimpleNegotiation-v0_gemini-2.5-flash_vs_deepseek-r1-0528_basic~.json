I am relatively low on Sheep.\n\nI want to trade away some Wheat/Wood for Sheep or Brick.\nLet's try to get some Sheep and maybe some Brick in exchange for Wheat and Wood.\n\nMy previous offer of 13 Wheat, 17 Wood -> 8 Ore, 5 Brick was likely too ambitious for Player 1, as that would be a gain of (8*38 + 5*20) = 404 value for me at a cost of (13*6 + 17*8) = 214 value for me.\n\nLet's try to trade some Wood or Wheat for Sheep.\nI have 17 Wood (value 8) and 13 Wheat (value 6).\nI have 5 Sheep (value 14).\n\nPlayer 1 offered 10 Sheep (140) and 10 Wood (80) for 7 Ore (266). They want to trade valuable Sheep for less valuable Ore. This suggests they have a lot of Sheep.\nGiven their last offer, they might be low on Ore.\n\nI have 17 Ore. I could offer some Ore, which is high value, to get even more valuable resources for me (like Sheep, of which I only have 5). If they are low on Ore, they might be willing to pay a premium.\nLet's try to get some Sheep.\n\nI want to trade resources with lower value for resources with higher value.\nI want more Sheep.\nI have a lot of Ore (high value, 38). I also have a lot of Wood (low value, 8).\n\nHow about trading Wood for Sheep?\nIf I offer 10 Wood (value 80), what can I ask for?\nI have 5 Sheep. If I can get 3 Sheep (value 42), that's not enough.\n\nLet's stick to my original plan: obtain more Sheep or Brick, potentially by giving away Wheat or Wood.\nSince Player 1 previously offered Sheep and Wood for Ore, they might value Ore, Sheep, and Wood differently.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of low and medium value resources for high value ones?\nI have plenty of Wood and Brick. I'm low on Sheep.\nI have enough Ore.\n\nLet's try to get Sheep.\nMaybe 5 Wheat (30) + 5 Wood (40) = 70.\nWhat could I get for 70 value? 2 Sheep (28) are low. 1 Brick (20) + 1 Sheep (14) = 34. This is too low.\n\nI need a profitable trade.\nIf I offer 10 Wood (80), I want something more than 80 in return.\nMaybe 3 Sheep (42) and 2 Brick (40). That means I offer 80 and get 82. This is a small gain.\nBut I will improve my Sheep quantity which is low.\n\nLet's try to make an offer of Wood and Wheat for Sheep and Brick, a smaller, more digestible offer perhaps.\nOffer: 8 Wood (64), 5 Wheat (30) = 94 value.\nRequest: 3 Sheep (42), 3 Brick (60) = 102 value.\nThis is a gain of 8 value.
