My goal is to increase the total value of my resources.\n\nMy current resources and their values are:\n  - Wheat: 19 @ 5 = 95\n  - Wood: 6 @ 10 = 60\n  - Sheep: 18 @ 12 = 216\n  - Brick: 14 @ 26 = 364\n  - Ore: 14 @ 36 = 504\nTotal Value: 1239\n\nLast turn, I offered 2 Ore (value 72) for 2 Brick (value 52). This means my offer was unfavorable to me.\nHowever, it seems Player 1 accepted it. This means Player 1's resources changed as follows:\n- Player 1 gained 2 Ore\n- Player 1 lost 2 Brick\n\nAnd my resources changed as follows:\n- I lost 2 Ore. My Ore is now 12.\n- I gained 2 Brick. My Brick is now 16.\n\nMy new resource values:\n  - Wheat: 19 @ 5 = 95\n  - Wood: 6 @ 10 = 60\n  - Sheep: 18 @ 12 = 216\n  - Brick: 16 @ 26 = 416\n  - Ore: 12 @ 36 = 432\nTotal Value: 1219 (decreased from 1239 - this was a bad trade for me, assuming Player 1 had the resources)\n\nIt appears there was an error in my previous understanding/calculation. I should review my resources carefully before making further offers.\n\nLet's re-evaluate after the trade:\nInitial Player 0 resources:\n  + [Wheat]   Qty: 19   Value: 5\n  + [Wood]    Qty: 6    Value: 10\n  + [Sheep]   Qty: 18   Value: 12\n  + [Brick]   Qty: 14   Value: 26\n  + [Ore]     Qty: 14   Value: 36\n\nPlayer 0 offered 2 Ore (72 value) for 2 Brick (52 value).\nPlayer 1 accepted.\n\nPlayer 0's resources after trade:\n  + [Wheat]   Qty: 19   Value: 5    (95)\n  + [Wood]    Qty: 6    Value: 10   (60)\n  + [Sheep]   Qty: 18   Value: 12   (216)\n  + [Brick]   Qty: 14 + 2 = 16   Value: 26  (416)\n  + [Ore]     Qty: 14 - 2 = 12   Value: 36  (432)\nTotal Value Player 0 now has: 95 + 60 + 216 + 416 + 432 = 1219\n\nYes, my total value decreased, which indicates I made a poor trade. I need to be more careful.\nI should aim to trade resources I have in abundance or perceive as lower value for resources I want or perceive as higher value.\nMy goal is to increase my total value.\n\nGiven my current resources:\nWheat: 19 * 5 = 95\nWood: 6 * 10 = 60\nSheep: 18 * 12 = 216\nBrick: 16 * 26 = 416\nOre: 12 * 36 = 432\n\nI have a lot of Wheat and Sheep. I have less Wood but its value is lower.\nOre and Brick are my most valuable per unit.\n\nI will try to trade Wheat or Sheep for more valuable resources like Brick or Ore.\nHowever, given my previous mistake, I should aim for a clear value increase.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nI will offer something for Ore.\nMaybe a mix of lower-value items for a higher-value item.\nWhat about 10 Wheat (50 value) for 1 Ore (36 value)? No, that's bad for me.\nWhat about 5 Wheat (25 value) and 1 Wood (10 value)? That's 35 value for 1 Ore (36 value). This is close to even, slightly good for Player 1.\nI want to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me.\n\nI have a decent amount of Brick, but it's valuable.\nI have a lot of Sheep.\nLet's offer Sheep for Ore.\n1 Ore is 36.\n3 Sheep is 3 * 12 = 36. This is an even trade.\nWhat about offering 4 Sheep (48 value) for 1 Ore (36 value)? This is bad for me.\n\nI should identify what I have a lot of and what I want.\nI have 19 Wheat, 18 Sheep. I have less Wood (6).\nI really want more Ore and Brick because they are high value.\n\nLet's consider offering Wheat and Wood, as their values are lower.\nPerhaps 10 Wheat (value 50) for 2 Brick (value 52). This is slightly good for me.\nMy current Qty of Brick is 16. If I gain 2, I will have 18.\nThis is a reasonable offer.\n\nLet's try: `[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Brick]`\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",
