      "response": "Given the history of rejections, it's crucial to adjust my offer to create a mutually appealing trade while ensuring value gain for me. Player 1 has shown resistance to my previous proposals (1 Ore for 2 Brick and 4 Wheat for 2 Sheep), suggesting they may value Brick highly or have limited Sheep availability. To entice acceptance, I'll leverage my abundant, lower-value Wheat while targeting a high-value resource where I see a strategic advantage\u2014Brick (valued at 26 per unit). Here's the plan:\n\n### Proposed Trade:  \n**[Offer: 6 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick]**  \n- **I give:**  \n  - 6 Wheat: Valued by me at 6 \u00d7 6 = 36  \n  - 1 Wood: Valued at 10  \n  - **Total given:** 46 value  \n- **I request:**  \n  - 2 Brick: Valued by me at 2 \u00d7 26 = 52  \n  - **Net gain for me:** 6 value (52 - 46)  \n\n### Why this offer?\n1. **Attractive for Player 1:**  \n   - I'm offering 7 resources (Wheat + Wood) for only 2 Brick\u2014a bulk exchange that might appeal if they undervalue or have surplus Brick.  \n   - Wheat and Wood are lower-value utility resources; Player 1 might accept for versatility.  \n\n2. **Value-Driven for Me:**  \n   - I shed **Wheat** (lowest value: 6, high quantity) and minimal **Wood** to gain **Brick** (2nd highest value: 26).  \n   - Even with the loss of Wood, the net gain (+6) improves my total resource value.  \n\n3. **Strategic Safeguards:**  \n   - My Wheat (16) and Wood (10) are plentiful. Sacrificing 6 Wheat and 1 Wood leaves ample reserves.  \n   - If accepted, I gain Brick for potential future high-margin trades (e.g., Ore \u2192 Brick).  \n\nThis offer optimizes risk: modest gains with low opportunity cost. If rejected, future turns can test other combinations (e.g., Ore + Wheat for Brick/Sheep).  \n\n---  \n**Output:**  \n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick]",
