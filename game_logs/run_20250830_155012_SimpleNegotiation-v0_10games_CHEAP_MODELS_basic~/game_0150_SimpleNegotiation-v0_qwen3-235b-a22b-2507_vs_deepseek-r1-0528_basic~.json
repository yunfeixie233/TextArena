Since my goal is to increase my total resource value, I cannot accept this trade as it would leave me worse off.\n\nHowever, I'm still interested in negotiating! I propose a different trade that benefits us both more fairly. Specifically, I'll offer you 5 Wheat and 5 Wood in exchange for 5 Sheep. Here's why this could work:\n- You give me 5 Sheep (value: 5 \u00d7 18 = 90), but gain 5 Wheat (5 \u00d7 5 = 25) and 5 Wood (5 \u00d7 10 = 50), totaling 75 value\u2014aligning with what you were willing to part with in your original offer.\n- I gain 90 value in Sheep while giving up only 75 value in low-value resources (Wheat and Wood), netting a +15 gain for me\u2014allowing you to offload Sheep you might not need while getting the Wheat and Wood you clearly want.\n\nThis keeps the trade balanced for you while ensuring I see a profit.
