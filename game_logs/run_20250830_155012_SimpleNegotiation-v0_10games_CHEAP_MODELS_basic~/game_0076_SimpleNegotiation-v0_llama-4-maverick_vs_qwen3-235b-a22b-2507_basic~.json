Getting more might not be the best unless the trade is very favorable.\n- Brick is also quite valuable (30), and I have 13, so trading some could be an option.\n\nLet's make a new offer.

We need to make a decision on whether to accept, deny, or make a new offer.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Player 1's Last Offer\nPlayer 1's last offer was 1 Ore for 10 Wheat. This is not in our favor as it results in a net loss of value (50 for Wheat vs. 35 for Ore).\n\n## Step 3: Consider Making a New Offer\nSince our last offers were rejected, we should think of a more appealing trade. Let's consider offering something less valuable for something more valuable.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a New Trade Offer\nLet's offer 7 Wood (Value: 70) for 2 Ore (Value: 70). This trade maintains our current total value but changes the composition of our resources.\n\n## Step 5: Check if the New Offer is Valid and Favorable\nWe have 7 Wood, and we are offering it for 2 Ore.\n- We give away 7 Wood = 7 * 10 = 70\n- We receive 2 Ore = 2 * 35 = 70\n\nThis trade is neutral in terms of value but might be acceptable if it leads to future beneficial trades or if we believe the other player values these resources differently.\n\n## Step 6: Decide on the Action\nGiven that our previous offers were rejected, and Player 1's offer was not in our favor, making a new offer is a reasonable step. Let's offer 7 Wood for 2 Ore.\n\nThe action is: [Offer: 7 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
