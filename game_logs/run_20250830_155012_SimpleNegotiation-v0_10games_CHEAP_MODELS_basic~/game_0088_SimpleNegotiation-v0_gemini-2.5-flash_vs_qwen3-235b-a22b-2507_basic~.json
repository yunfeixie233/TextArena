Ore is the most valuable resource I have and one of the most valuable resources in the game. Brick is also valuable. Sheep and Wheat are less valuable. I'm generally looking to trade less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nGiven 1 Ore is worth 38, and 2 Sheep are worth 28, I can increase the Sheep I offer for 1 Ore.\nI have a lot of Sheep and Ore, so I'm willing to part with some.\n\nLet's try to offer more Sheep for Ore or maybe some Brick.\nHow about I try to get some more Brick or Ore. I have plenty of Wheat and Wood that are low in value.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood for Ore or Brick.\n1 Wood is 11, 1 Ore is 38. I'd need to offer a lot of Wood.\n3 Wood for 1 Ore is 33 vs 38. That's a good deal for me.\n4 Wood for 1 Ore is 44 vs 38. That's a moderately bad deal for me, but it might be accepted.\n\nLet's try trading off some of my abundant Wheat or Wood for something more valuable.\nHow about I try to get some Brick.\nI have 19 Wheat (val 6), 12 Wood (val 11), 15 Sheep (val 14).\nPlayer 1 has not made any offers, so I don't know what they want.\n\nLet's try to exchange 3 Wood (value 3*11=33) for 1 Ore (value 38).
