That rejection is entirely rational.\n\nKey constraints\n\u2022 Brick is their scarcest good but also their most valuable, so they\u2019ll only trade it if the offered premium is large (\u224830\u201340 %).  \n\u2022 The same holds for your Ore (34 each), but you clearly don\u2019t want to give that away cheaply.  \n\u2022 Wood is the joint lowest-valued resource. You and they both value it at 8, so Wood is a \u201cneutral\u201d medium for exchange.\n\nImmediate value-lever\nMy current inventory (before trades) looks like this:\nSheep: 16 \u00d7 18 = 288  \nWood:  20 \u00d7 8  = 160  \nBrick:  13 \u00d7 26 = 338  \nOre:   14 \u00d7 34 = 476  \n\nNet value = 288 + 160 + 338 + 476 = 1,262  \n\nBecause Brick is highly valued, adding more Brick (without overpaying) always improves my standing.
