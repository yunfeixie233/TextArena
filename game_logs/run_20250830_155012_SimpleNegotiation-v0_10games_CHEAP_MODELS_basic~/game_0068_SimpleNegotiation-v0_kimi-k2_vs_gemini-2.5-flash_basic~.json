      "response": "Let me analyze the current situation.\n\nAfter the trades:\n- **First trade**: I gave 5 Wheat, 4 Wood for 3 Brick, 2 Ore\n- **Second trade**: I gave 2 Ore, 1 Sheep for 5 Wood, 5 Wheat\n\n**Current resources**:\n- Wheat: 25 - 5 + 5 = 25\n- Wood: 20 - 4 + 5 = 21\n- Sheep: 7 - 1 = 6\n- Brick: 17 + 3 = 20\n- Ore: 15 + 2 - 2 = 15\n\n**Values**:\n- Wheat: 25 \u00d7 5 = 125\n- Wood: 21 \u00d7 10 = 210\n- Sheep: 6 \u00d7 17 = 102\n- Brick: 20 \u00d7 26 = 520\n- Ore: 15 \u00d7 33 = 495\n- **Total: 1,452**\n\nI notice that my initial trades helped net me +3 Wood but I lost a Sheep. Given the high value of Ore (33), I should try to accumulate more Ore while maintaining a balance. Also, my Wood count is now at 21, which is respectable.\n\nLooking at trade patterns:\n- Player 1 has rejected multiple offers for Ore (including 5 Wheat + 3 Wood for 6 Ore)\n- Player 1 seems willing to give up 5 Wood/Wheat for 2 Ore + 1 Sheep\n- The common element here is **Ore is precious to Player 1**\n\nI'll try offering more total value while targeting Ore:\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Sheep -> 7 Ore]",
