My Wheat is abundant too (10), yet its value is low. The other side seems reluctant to give away Sheep/Ore for cheap, so the cleanest value upgrade is to convert my low-value Wheat into whatever they\u2019ll give.\n\nProposed trade:\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Sheep, 2 Ore]\n\n- For me: gives 2 Agents worth 17 and 33 \u2192 100 value, sacrificing 6 Agents worth 5 each \u2192 30 value. Net +70 value, boosting final score well above 600.  \n- Short and clear\u2014only two commodities, so it\u2019s trivial for them to evaluate.
