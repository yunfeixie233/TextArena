      "response": "The current offer from Player 0 is: Offered items: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> Requested items: 2 Brick.\n\nLet's analyze the value of this trade for me (Player 1).\n\nMy current resource values:\n- Wheat: 5\n- Wood: 9\n- Sheep: 16\n- Brick: 25\n- Ore: 40\n\nValue of offered items (from Player 0):\n- 2 Wood: 2 * 9 = 18\n- 1 Sheep: 1 * 16 = 16\nTotal offered value: 18 + 16 = 34\n\nValue of requested items (from Player 1):\n- 2 Brick: 2 * 25 = 50\n\nSince the requested value (50) is greater than the offered value (34), this trade is not favorable for me. I should deny this offer and propose a new one.\n\nMy strategy is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I want to trade away resources with lower value per unit for resources with higher value per unit. My current \"high value\" resources are Ore (40) and Brick (25). My \"low value\" resources are Wheat (5) and Wood (9). Sheep (16) is in the middle.\n\nI have a lot of Brick (19) and Ore (17). I also have a decent amount of Wheat (16). I have fewer Sheep (5) and Wood (8).\n\nGiven Player 0 seems interested in Brick (from their previous offer), I might be able to leverage my abundance of Brick. However, they previously asked for 3 Brick for 1 Ore and 1 Sheep (value 40+16=56 for 3*25=75, which was bad for me). And now 2 Brick for 2 Wood and 1 Sheep (value 34 for 2*25=50, also bad). This suggests Player 0 wants Brick but is trying to exploit my perceived surplus.\n\nI need to make an offer that is favorable to me, meaning the value I receive is higher than the value I give away. I also want to get rid of lower-value items if possible.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat, Wood, or Sheep for Brick or Ore.\nPlayer 0 seems to be low on Brick or values it highly.\n\nConsider trading away my excess Wheat for something more valuable.\nIf Player 0 is giving up Wood and Sheep, maybe they have a surplus of those. I don't want more Wood or Sheep unless the value is overwhelmingly good.\n\nLet's make an offer where I get Ore or Brick.\n\nOption 1: Trade Wheat for Brick.\nValue of 1 Brick = 25. Value of 1 Wheat = 5. I need 5 Wheat for 1 Brick to be even.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick] Value: 25 -> 25. This is even. I want to make it favorable for me.\n\nOption 2: Trade Wood for Brick.\nValue of 1 Wood = 9. Value of 1 Brick = 25. I need almost 3 Wood for 1 Brick.\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick] Value: 27 -> 25. This is slightly bad for me.\n\nLet's try to get Ore, as it's the highest value.\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue to offer: 16 (Sheep) + 9 (Wood) = 25\nValue to receive: 40 (Ore)\nThis is a good trade for me, gaining 15 value. I have plenty of Ore, so I might want to hold onto it, but if I can get it for cheap, it's good. However, I only have 5 Sheep, so giving one away might be risky.\n\nAlternatively: trade away Brick for something I value more if I can get a good deal. But Brick is already high value (25).\n\nLet's go back to Player 0's offers. They offered Wood and Sheep for Brick. This means they likely need Brick, and might be willing to pay for it. I have 19 Brick.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick for something more valuable to me? Or equal value, but I turn low-value items into high-value items.\nI have a surplus of Brick. I could trade Brick for Ore at a good rate for me.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]\nValue given: 2 * 25 = 50\nValue received: 40 (Ore) + 16 (Sheep) = 56\nThis is gaining 6 value for me. I am trading 2 high-value items for 1 high-value and 1 medium-value. I have 19 Brick, so giving 2 away isn't a problem. I have 17 Ore and 5 Sheep, so getting more could be good or bad depending on the target. If Player 0 has excess Ore and Sheep, this might work. They gave away Wood and Sheep in their last offer, so they likely have a surplus of Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get Ore specifically.\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue given: 2*9 + 1*16 = 18 + 16 = 34\nValue received: 1*40 = 40\nThis would be a gain of 6 value for me. I have 8 Wood and 5 Sheep, so giving up 2 Wood and 1 Sheep is manageable. Player 0 previously offered 2 Wood and 1 Sheep, which implies they have these resources. This could be a good offer because what they offered originally (2 Wood, 1 Sheep for 2 Brick) had a value of 34 for them and they wanted 50 value from me. This offer is asking for 40 value from them for 34 value from me. It's a flip.\n\nLet's try this.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Looking at the history, Player 1 has shown interest in acquiring Brick but rejected my previous offers, which were focused on gaining multiple Bricks with lower-value resources like Ore, Sheep, and Wood. However, Player 1's own offers (e.g., offering 5 Wheat for 1 Brick) suggest they are willing to trade large quantities of Wheat for Brick at those ratios. Since I want to increase my total resource value and this trade is advantageous for me (Brick has a per-unit value of 3.125, while Wheat is 1.0, so 5 Wheat for 1 Brick gives me a net gain of 1.875 in value), I'll propose this exact trade that Player 1 previously offered but I foolishly rejected. This is the last turn, so it's worth a shot for a guaranteed gain if accepted.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 5 Wheat]",
