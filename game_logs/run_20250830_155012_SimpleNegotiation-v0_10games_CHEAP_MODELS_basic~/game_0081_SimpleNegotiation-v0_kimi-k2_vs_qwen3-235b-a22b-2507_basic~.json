The values are:  \nWheat 6, Wood 11, Sheep 12, Brick 23, Ore 34.  \nThus my priority from lowest to highest is: Wheat < Wood < Sheep < Brick < Ore.\n\nI will always try to give away the least\u2013valued resources while asking for the most\u2013valued ones, but I must also look for any way to convert inefficient (many low-value cards) holdings into a smaller amount of higher-value cards. Removing excess low-value cards is just as good as gaining high-value ones.\n\nInventory check\n- Wheat 14 (worth 84 points total)\n- Wood 25 (275 points)\n- Sheep 20 (240 points)\n- Brick 7 (161 points)\n- Ore 17 (578 points)\n\nObservations\n- Wheat is by far my least valuable resource\u2014pure trade fodder.  \n- Wood and Sheep are also comparatively low value per card.  \n- Brick and especially Ore are what I really need to stock up on if possible.\n\nRound-0 starter\nI\u2019ll open with a modest offer that lets my opponent pick up the lowest-tier resources while I try to convert them into **Ore** first, **Brick** second. I\u2019ll keep some Sheep because I don\u2019t want to seem completely unreasonable; a 2-for-1 effective upgrade inside the same tier keeps the numbers clean.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Ore]",

Offer a more favorable bundle for them.\n2. Ask for something they\u2019re okay to give up\u2014right now I believe that is **either Wheat or Wood**, since they rejected the Ore offer.\n3. Avoid giving up any Brick or Ore unless I receive a large premium (their high values are based on scarcity).\n\nLooking at my stockpile:  \n\u2022 I have lots of Sheep (20) and Wheat (14), both at relatively low values compared to Brick and Ore.  \n\u2022 I can spare a small amount of Wood\u2014if said Wood nets me a premium\u2014but not too much (its value:11 is mid-tier). \n\nI\u2019ll offer what I have most surplus of (Sheep and Wheat) and request the resource I have the least of (and is most available to them): Wood.
