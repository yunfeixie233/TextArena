      "response": "### **Game Analysis & Strategy Update**\n\n**Current Turn:** 9  \n**Resources After Last Trade (Turn 8):**  \n- **Brick:** 20 (14 + 3 + 3 from trades)  \n- **Ore:** 10 (11 - 4 from first trade)  \n- **Sheep:** 8 (24 - 5 - 6 from trades)  \n- **Wheat:** 6 (9 - 2 - 1 from trades)  \n- **Wood:** 3 (5 - 1 from trade)  \n\n**Total Current Value:**  \n- Brick: 20 \u00d7 2.14 \u2248 42.8  \n- Ore: 10 \u00d7 3.27 \u2248 32.7  \n- Sheep: 8 \u00d7 0.75 \u2248 6  \n- Wheat: 6 \u00d7 0.67 \u2248 4  \n- Wood: 3 \u00d7 1.8 \u2248 5.4  \n**Total: \u2248 91**\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n1. **Brick is Overstocked:** I now have **20 Brick**, but Brick\u2019s value per unit (2.14) is low. Trading excess Brick for higher-value resources (like Ore) is optimal.\n2. **Ore is Scarce:** Only **10 Ore left**, and its value (3.27/unit) is high. Prioritize acquiring more Ore or Wood (1.8/unit over Sheep/Wheat).\n3. **Sheep/Wheat are Low-Value:** Use remaining Sheep sparely; Wheat is minimally useful.\n\n### **Next Optimal Trade Proposal for Turn 9:**\nOffer excess Brick for Ore/Wood to maximize value.\n\n**Offer:**  \n[Offer: 4 Brick -> 2 Ore, 1 Wood]  \n*(4 Brick = 8.56 value \u2192 2 Ore + 1 Wood = 6.54 + 1.8 = 8.34 value. Fair exchange, slight loss but clears low-value Brick.)*  \n\n**Rationale:**  \n- Brick is surplus; Wood/Ore raise total value.  \n- This is my last playable turn (Turn 9), so a final push for high-value resources is critical.",
