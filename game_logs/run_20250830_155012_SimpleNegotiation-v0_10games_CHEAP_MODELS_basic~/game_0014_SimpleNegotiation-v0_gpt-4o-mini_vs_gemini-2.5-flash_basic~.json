      "response": "Let's summarize the resources and trades made so far, and determine your current resources after the trades:\n\n**Initial Resources:**\n- Wheat: 15 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 6 (Value: 10)\n- Sheep: 7 (Value: 12)\n- Brick: 10 (Value: 21)\n- Ore: 15 (Value: 33)\n\n**Trade Summary:**\n1. **Trade with Player 1**: \n   - Offered: 4 Wheat, 5 Wood \n   - Received: 1 Ore, 2 Brick \n\n2. **Trade with Player 1**: \n   - Offered: 2 Wood, 5 Wheat \n   - Received: 1 Ore, 1 Brick \n\n3. **Trade with Player 1**: \n   - Offered: 4 Sheep, 1 Brick \n   - Received: 3 Ore\n\n**Current Resources After Trades:**\n\n1. After the first trade:\n   - Wheat: 15 - 4 = 11\n   - Wood: 6 - 5 = 1\n   - Sheep: 7\n   - Brick: 10 + 2 = 12\n   - Ore: 15 + 1 = 16\n\n2. After the second trade:\n   - Wheat: 11 - 5 = 6\n   - Wood: 1 - 2 = -1 (Not possible, so you would only provide 1 Wood and keep the trade balanced)\n   - Sheep: 7\n   - Brick: 12 + 1 = 13\n   - Ore: 16 + 1 = 17\n  \n3. Correcting the 2nd trade impact:\n   - Wheat: 11 - 5 = 6\n   - Wood: 1 - 1 = 0\n   - Sheep: 7\n   - Brick: 12 + 1 = 13\n   - Ore: 16 + 1 = 17\n   **(Your balance allows for this)**\n\n3. After the third trade:\n   - Wheat: 6 (no change)\n   - Wood: 0 (no change)\n   - Sheep: 7 - 4 = 3\n   - Brick: 13 - 1 = 12\n   - Ore: 17 + 3 = 20\n\n**Final Resources (after all trades):**\n- Wheat: 6 \n- Wood: 0\n- Sheep: 3 \n- Brick: 12 \n- Ore: 20 \n\nGiven your current resources, consider a new trade offer to maximize the value of your resources. \n\n**Next Offer:**\nYou could propose a trade that offloads some of your Sheep or Brick for Wood or Wheat, or offer some Ore since you have a surplus.\n\n**Example Trade Offer:**\n- [Offer: 2 Ore, 3 Sheep -> 4 Wood]\n\nNow, it's your turn to make an offer!",
