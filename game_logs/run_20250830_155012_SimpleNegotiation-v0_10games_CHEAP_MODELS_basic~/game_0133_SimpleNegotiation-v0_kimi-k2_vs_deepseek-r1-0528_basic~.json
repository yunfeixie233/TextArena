      "response": "Given the history of rejected offers, I need to propose a trade that benefits me by increasing my total resource value while potentially appealing to Player 0. My analysis shows:\n\n- I value Wheat (6) and Wood (11) lower, while Ore (32) is my highest-value resource. Player 0 has consistently offered Wheat and Wood in exchange for Ore and Brick, indicating they may undervalue those items.\n- Previous attempts to trade for Ore (e.g., offering Sheep and Wood) were rejected, so I\u2019ll adjust by including Wheat to add perceived incentives without compromising my value. Specifically, I propose:\n  - Giving 3 Sheep and 1 Wheat (total value to me: 3\u00d717 + 1\u00d76 = 51 + 6 = 57).\n  - Receiving 2 Ore (total value to me: 2\u00d732 = 64).\n  - This results in a net gain of 7 in value for me, while offering Player 0 Sheep\u2014which I value moderately\u2014and a small amount of low-value Wheat.\n\nI have sufficient resources (17 Sheep, 21 Wheat) to accommodate this, and it avoids the high-value Brick that Player 0 seems protective of.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",
