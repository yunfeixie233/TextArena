This exchange is highly favorable for us since Wheat has low value (6 per unit) while Ore is our highest-value resource (39 per unit). Trading 4 Wheat (total value: 24) for 1 Ore (value: 39) nets us a gain of 15 in resource value. With 14 Wheat remaining, I'll repeat this tested offer to continue optimizing my resource value efficiently.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
