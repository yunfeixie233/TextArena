This time, I'm proposing a more efficient deal: I'll reduce the Wheat while keeping the Sheep steady, making it a better exchange for you. Specifically, I offer **4 Sheep and 3 Wheat** in return for **3 Ore**. This simplifies your resource management and gives you more flexibility.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 3 Ore]",
