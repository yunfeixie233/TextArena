Here\u2019s a summary of my current resources after the trades:\n\n- Wheat: 15 - 3 = 12\n- Wood: 18\n- Sheep: 14 - 3 + 2 = 13\n- Brick: 0 + 5 + 2 = 7\n- Ore: 5 - 2 + 1 = 4\n\nCurrent resources:\n- Wheat: 12\n- Wood: 18\n- Sheep: 13\n- Brick: 7\n- Ore: 4\n\nNow, I need to consider the latest offer from Player 1: \n\n**Offer from Player 1**: 2 Ore for 4 Brick.\n\nI currently have 4 Ore and 7 Brick. If I accept this offer, I'll have:\n- Wheat: 12\n- Wood: 18\n- Sheep: 13\n- Brick: 7 - 4 = 3\n- Ore: 4 - 2 = 2\n\nAccepting the trade reduces my Brick, but I'm gaining Ore, which has a higher value. Therefore, I'll accept the trade.\n\nFinal move:\n[Accept]",
