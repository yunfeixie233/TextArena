Let's analyze the values:\n\n1. **Highest Value Resources**: Ore (37) and Brick (26) are the most valuable.\n2. **Lowest Value Resources**: Wheat (6) and Wood (10) are less valuable.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering less valuable resources for more valuable ones or balancing the trade to increase overall value.\n\n#### Trade Offer for Turn 1\n\nLet's propose a trade that could potentially increase our total value. We can offer some Wheat and Wood for Brick or Ore, as they are more valuable.\n\n**Offer**: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]`\n\n- We are offering: 5 Wheat (Value: 5*6 = 30) and 2 Wood (Value: 2*10 = 20), Total Offered Value = 50\n- We are requesting: 1 Brick (Value: 26) and 1 Ore (Value: 37), Total Requested Value = 63\n\nThis trade increases our total value by 13 (63 - 50).\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]`\n\n#### Waiting for Response\n\nWe will wait for the opponent's response to our offer. If they accept, we will gain 1 Brick and 1 Ore. If they deny, we will have to come up with another strategy for the next turn.\n\nPlease provide the response or proceed with the next turn.",
