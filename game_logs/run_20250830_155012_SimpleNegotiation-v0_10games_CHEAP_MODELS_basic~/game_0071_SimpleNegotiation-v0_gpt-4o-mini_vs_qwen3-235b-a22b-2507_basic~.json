      "response": "In the Negotiation Game, it seems that I have already made several offers without success and have accepted an offer from Player 1. Currently, let's calculate my new resources and values.\n\n### Current Resources After Trades:\n1. **Initial Resources:**\n   - Wheat: 21 (Value: 5)\n   - Wood: 12 (Value: 11)\n   - Sheep: 12 (Value: 16) \n   - Brick: 24 (Value: 20)\n   - Ore: 24 (Value: 40)\n\n2. **Trade Accepted from Player 1:**\n   - Offered: 3 Sheep and 5 Wood\n   - Received: 4 Brick and 1 Ore\n\n3. **Updated Resources:**\n   - Wheat: 21 (Value: 5)\n   - Wood: 12 - 5 = 7 (Value: 11)\n   - Sheep: 12 - 3 = 9 (Value: 16)\n   - Brick: 24 + 4 = 28 (Value: 20)\n   - Ore: 24 + 1 = 25 (Value: 40)\n\nNow, let's assess my current resources and their values:\n\n### Current Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: 21 (Value: 105)\n- Wood: 7 (Value: 77)\n- Sheep: 9 (Value: 144)\n- Brick: 28 (Value: 560)\n- Ore: 25 (Value: 1000)\n\nI can make another trade offer. To strategize, let's look for potential trades that might enhance my total resource value further. \n\nSince Player 1 hasn't made an offer in the last round and I've had multiple rejected offers, I should consider what resources they might need.\n\n### Proposed Trade Offer to Player 1:\nI will make the following offer based on my remaining resources and potential needs of Player 1. \n\n**Proposed Offer:**\n- Offered: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood \n- Requested: 5 Brick, 2 Ore \n\n### Action:\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 5 Brick, 2 Ore]",
