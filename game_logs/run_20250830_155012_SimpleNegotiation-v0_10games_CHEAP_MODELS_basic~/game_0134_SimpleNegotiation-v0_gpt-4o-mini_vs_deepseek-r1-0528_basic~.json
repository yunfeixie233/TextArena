      "response": "After reviewing the game state and the trade history, I notice that Player 0 highly values Brick, as they accepted a trade where they gave 3 Sheep (worth 16 each) for just 1 Brick (worth 22) from me. However, I currently have 0 Brick left, so I cannot leverage that. My current resource values are: Wheat at 5 per unit (lowest), Wood at 8, Sheep at 16, and Ore at 38 (highest). I have a surplus of Sheep (30) and Wood (21), and I want to trade these for Ore to increase my total value, since Ore is my most valuable resource.\n\nPlayer 0 rejected my previous offer of 1 Ore for 4 Sheep, which would have hurt me (giving 38 vs. getting 64 in Sheep value, a 26-net loss if accepted). To gain value, I need to ensure any trade has a net-positive outcome for me. I'll target an exchange where I trade away lower-value or excessive resources for Ore. A reasonable offer is 3 Wood and 2 Sheep for 1 Ore:\n\n- I give: 3 Wood (3 * 8 = 24) and 2 Sheep (2 * 16 = 32), totaling 56 in value.\n- I get: 1 Ore (1 * 38 = 38).\n- Net effect: I lose 56 and gain 38, resulting in an 18-value loss\u2014this is not profitable.\n\nRe-evaluating, I need to offer more aggressively for Ore. I'll scale the offer down to minimize risk:\n\n- I give: 4 Sheep (4 * 16 = 64).\n- I get: 1 Ore (38).\n- Net effect: 64 - 38 = 26 loss\u2014if accepted, this would reduce my value.\n\nThis won't work. Instead, I should use my Wheat, which has the lowest per-unit value (5). I have 14 Wheat, so I can afford to trade some. I'll propose a package of Wheat and a small amount of Sheep to keep the offer attractive and funded:\n\n- **Offer: 10 Wheat and 1 Sheep for 1 Ore**\n  - I give: 10 Wheat (10 * 5 = 50) + 1 Sheep (16) = 66 in total value.\n  - I get: 1 Ore (38).\n  - Net change: 66 - 38 = 28 loss\u2014if accepted, it would decrease my total value.\n\nThis is still a loss and not acceptable. Since all such direct offers risk losses, I must reconsider. Player 0 may be unwilling to part with Ore, as evidenced by them rejecting my previous Ore-for-Sheep offer. Alternatively, they might have a surplus of Sheep from earlier trades. Instead of pushing for Ore, I'll try to reduce my overwhelming Sheep count (30) by trading for Wood, which is more manageable and still holds value (8 per unit) without overcommitting:\n\n- A low-risk, moderate-gain offer: 3 Sheep for 1 Wood and 1 Wheat.\n  - I give: 3 Sheep (3 * 16 = 48).\n  - I get: 1 Wood (8) + 1 Wheat (5) = 13.\n  - Net effect: Loss of 35\u2014too steep.\n\nThis is unsustainable. I need an edge based on the history\u2014Player 0 has shown they overpay for specific resources (Brick), but withoutBrick, I need to pivot. After rethinking, I'll offer a balanced trade that might appeal if Player 0 wants to balance their resources: 1 Sheep for 1 Wood.\n\n- **Offer: 1 Sheep for 1 Wood**\n  - I give: 1 Sheep (16).\n  - I get: 1 Wood (8).\n  - Net change: Loss of 8\u2014this reduces my value if accepted.\n\nThere's no safe trade here. Since I haven't found a net-positive offer after careful analysis, and Player 0 has not made an offer this turn, I'll focus on conserving my current resources. I have 1516 total value (up from 1476 initially), so for this turn, I'll make no offer to avoid a forced loss. This allows me to wait for Player 0's next move and react accordingly.\nI have carefully reviewed my resources and trade history again. My total value is currently 1516, which is a net gain from the initial 1476. However, I don't see a trade offer I can make in this turn that guarantees a net increase in my total value without overcommitting or taking a loss. Player 0 has shown a strong preference for Brick in past trades, but I have zero Brick left. Any attempts to trade my surplus resources (like Sheep or Wood) for higher-value Ore would likely result in a net loss given the valuation differences. I also want to avoid trades that devalue my holdings or risk rejection. Therefore, for this turn, I choose to pass and make no trade offer.\n\n[No new trade offer]",
