Given the current distribution and values, we'll start by making an offer that could potentially benefit both parties.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. We have a high quantity of Wheat (low value) and Ore (high value). Trading some Wheat for other resources might not be beneficial unless we get a very good deal.\n2. We have a relatively balanced distribution of Sheep and a moderate quantity of Wood.\n\n### Initial Offer\n\nConsidering the values and quantities, a reasonable initial offer could involve trading some of our Wheat (the lowest value resource) for a resource that is either of higher value or potentially scarce for us but abundant for the opponent. However, without knowing the opponent's resources, we'll make an educated guess based on our own resource valuation.\n\nLet's propose a trade that gives up some Wheat (low value) for Brick (higher value). Since we have 15 Wheat and 5 Brick, an example offer could be:\n- **[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]**: This translates to '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\nGiven the above analysis, our action for Turn 1 is:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'.\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.",

Although the trade wasn't highly favorable in terms of immediate value (since 25 > 22), it might be part of a larger strategy or an attempt to initiate a negotiation.\n\nGiven that Player 1 accepted the offer and made no new trade offer, it's now my turn to analyze potential trades.\n\nTo make a beneficial trade, I need to identify resources that I can offer which are of lower value to me than what I can receive. Let's examine the current values and potential trades:\n\n1. Wheat (Value: 5)\n2. Wood (Value: 12)\n3. Sheep (Value: 15)\n4. Brick (Value: 22) - We just got one, so we might not want to give it away immediately unless for a good reason.\n5. Ore (Value: 39) - High value, so we should be cautious about giving it away.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering resources of lower value for those of higher value. For example, offering Wheat or Wood for something more valuable.\n\nLet's propose a trade:\n- Offering 3 Wheat (Value: 5 * 3 = 15) for 1 Wood (Value: 12) wouldn't be a good trade.\n- However, offering 2 Wood (Value: 12 * 2 = 24) for 1 Ore (Value: 39) could be a good trade since 24 < 39.\n\nThus, a possible trade offer could be: `[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\n`[Offer: 2 Wood, 0 Wheat, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wood, 0 Wheat, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 1 Ore]` is simplified to `[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`.\n\nThe correct format of the offer is: `[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`.\n\nMy action: `[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`",

      "response": "After evaluating the last trade where I gave 2 Sheep and 1 Wheat (total value 41) for 1 Ore (value 40), resulting in a net loss of 1, I need to prioritize value-positive trades to increase my total resource value. Player 0 previously accepted 5 Wheat for 1 Brick, indicating they may overvalue Brick relative to Wheat. Currently, I have ample Wheat (20 units, value 5 each) and want to leverage this for a profitable trade targeting Brick (value 22 each). \n\nMy analysis:\n- Brick is high-value for me (22), while Wheat is low (5). \n- Trading 7 Wheat (35 value) for 2 Brick (44 value) would net me +9 in value, but Player 0\u2019s history (accepting 5 Wheat per Brick) suggests they expect a steeper ratio. \n- To make the offer more enticing, I\u2019m increasing Wheat to 8 units (40 value) for 2 Brick. Though I now give up 8 \u00d7 5 = 40 value for 2 \u00d7 22 = 44 value, this still nets me +4 value, and the rate (4 Wheat per Brick) is better for Player 0 than their initial trade (5 Wheat per Brick). \n\nGiven Player 0\u2019s demonstrated willingness to trade Brick for Wheat, I propose:  \n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",
