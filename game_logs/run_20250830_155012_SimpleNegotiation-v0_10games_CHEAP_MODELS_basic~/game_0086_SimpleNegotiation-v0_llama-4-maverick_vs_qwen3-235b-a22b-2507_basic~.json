      "response": "### Negotiation Game: Initial Analysis and First Turn\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: Qty: 5, Value: 6\n- Wood: Qty: 19, Value: 11\n- Sheep: Qty: 19, Value: 18\n- Brick: Qty: 22, Value: 23\n- Ore: Qty: 9, Value: 37\n\n#### Total Value of Current Resources:\nTo calculate the total value, we multiply the quantity of each resource by its value and sum them up.\n- Total Value = (5*6) + (19*11) + (19*18) + (22*23) + (9*37)\n- Total Value = 30 + 209 + 342 + 506 + 333 = 1420\n\n#### Strategy:\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources through trades. To do this, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or at least maintain the quantity of higher-value resources while getting more of other resources that could be used for future trades.\n\n#### Initial Observation:\n- The highest value resource I have is Ore (Value: 37), followed by Brick (Value: 23).\n- Relatively, Wheat has the lowest value (Value: 6).\n\n#### First Turn:\nTo start, I'll make an offer that tries to utilize the resources I have in a way that could potentially increase my total value. I have a significant amount of Brick and a good amount of Sheep. Let's see if I can trade some of my lower-value or equally valued resources for something that might be more valuable or at least not decrease my total value significantly.\n\nLet's propose a trade that gives away some Wheat (lowest value resource) and tries to get a resource that could be valuable or at least matches the value given away.\n\n#### Trade Offer:\nSince Wheat is of the lowest value and I have a small quantity, I'll offer it in exchange for a resource that might be slightly more valuable or equal. Let's offer 5 Wheat for 1 Ore (since Ore is highly valued, getting more of it would be beneficial).\n\n**Action:**\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis is my first move.

Let's examine the last offer made by Player 1: \n Offered items: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> Requested items: 4 Wood\n\nTo evaluate this offer, let's calculate the total value of the resources being offered and requested:\n- Offered: 5 Wheat (5 * 6 = 30) + 2 Sheep (2 * 18 = 36) = 66\n- Requested: 4 Wood (4 * 11 = 44)\n\nSince 66 (offered) is greater than 44 (requested), this is a potentially good offer for me as it results in a net gain.\n\nConsidering my current resources and the offer:\n- I have 19 Wood, so giving up 4 Wood is feasible.\n- I don't have enough Wheat to fulfill the offered quantity of 5 Wheat, but Player 1 is offering 5 Wheat, so I don't need to have it initially.\n\nLet's accept the offer since it seems beneficial.\n\nMy action: [Accept]",
