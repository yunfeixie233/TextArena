Current total value  \n   Wheat: 19 \u00d7 6 = 114  \n   Wood: 8 \u00d7 10 = 80  \n   Sheep: 12 \u00d7 15 = 180  \n   Brick: 8 \u00d7 24 = 192  \n   Ore: 19 \u00d7 37 = 703  \n   Total = 1269  \n\n2. What do I need? Brick (24) has the second-highest value per unit and I only have 8, the smallest stockpile of any resource. Ore (37) is already abundant. Wood has been under-supplied in every offer by P0, so its relative scarcity may be working against me\u2014more Wood could make future deals easier.\n\n3. What can I spare?  \n   Extra Wheat and Ore. I still stay wealthy if I shed up to 8\u201310 Wheat and 4\u20135 Ore.\n\n4. Crafting an offer that improves my total value  \n   Goal: get \u22656 Brick and \u22654 Wood, giving up low-marginal-value Wheat and Ore.  \n   Give: 6 Wheat (6\u00d76 = 36) + 2 Ore (2\u00d737 = 74) = 110 value traded out.  \n   Take: 6 Brick (6\u00d724 = 144) + 4 Wood (4\u00d710 = 40) = 184 value taken in.  \n   Net gain = +74 value.\n\n5. Format the offer.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 2 Ore -> 6 Brick, 4 Wood]",

You would give away:\n   - 6 Wheat (Value: 30)\n   - 2 Ore (Value: 76)\n\nCalculating the total value change:\n- Value gained = 138 (Brick) + 48 (Wood) = 186\n- Value given = 30 (Wheat) + 76 (Ore) = 106\n- Net Value increase = 186 - 106 = 80\n\nThis trade would significantly increase your value.
