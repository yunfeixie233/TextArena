      "response": "Before I make an offer, I need to know what my opponent (Player 1) has. I can't make an effective offer without knowing what they might be willing to trade and what they might need.\n\nSince I don't have that information, and it's my turn to make an *initial* offer, I will propose a trade that seems generally beneficial for both parties if they have a good mix of resources. I will aim to get more high-value resources while giving away some of my more abundant, lower-value resources.\n\nMy current total value:\nWheat: 24 * 6 = 144\nWood: 22 * 12 = 264\nSheep: 20 * 15 = 300\nBrick: 14 * 30 = 420\nOre: 14 * 36 = 504\n**Total: 1632**\n\nI have a lot of Wheat and Wood. Ore and Brick are high value. I want to acquire more high-value resources.\n\nLet's try to convert some Wheat and Wood into Ore or Brick.\n\nI'll offer a good quantity of my lower-value resources for a smaller quantity of their potentially higher-value resources.\n\nProposed Offer: I offer 10 Wheat and 5 Wood. My value given: (10*6) + (5*12) = 60 + 60 = 120.\nWhat I want: 2 Ore and 1 Brick. My value requested: (2*36) + (1*30) = 72 + 30 = 102.\n\nThis offer is slightly in their favor on paper in terms of my stated values, which might incentivize them to accept, assuming they need Wheat or Wood. I'm trading quantity of low-value for quality of high-value, and even if the direct value exchange isn't hugely in my favor from the values given, the *utility* of getting more high-value resources is what I'm after.\n\nLet's adjust it slightly to be more balanced based on the values. If I want a net value gain, I need to request more value than I give.\n\nWhat if I offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood (Value: 120)\nAnd request: 3 Ore (Value: 3 * 36 = 108) OR 4 Brick (Value: 4 * 30 = 120) OR 2 Ore, 1 Brick (Value: 102)\n\nLet's be aggressive and try to get a net gain from the first offer itself.\n\nOffer: 8 Wheat, 5 Wood (Value: 8*6 + 5*12 = 48 + 60 = 108)\nRequest: 3 Ore (Value: 3*36 = 108) -- This is balanced or slightly less if I value Wheat/Wood less.\n\nLet's try to get Brick, which is also high value and I have fewer of than Ore.\n\nOffer: 12 Wheat (Value: 12 * 6 = 72)\nRequest: 3 Brick (Value: 3 * 30 = 90)\nThis trades my low value for their high value, and I gain 18 in value according to the given numbers. This seems like a good first offer to test the waters.\n\n[Offer: 12 Wheat -> 3 Brick]",
