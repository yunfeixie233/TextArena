I have a significant amount of Wood and Brick, and a relatively high-value resource in Ore. \n\nTo start, I'll think about what I can offer and what I might request. Since Ore is very valuable and I have a decent quantity of it, I might consider offering some Ore for something else that is valuable or for a resource that I think is underrepresented in my collection but has potential for growth in value.\n\nHowever, without knowing the opponent's resources or their needs, I'll start by making a general offer that aims to increase my total value. I'll look to offer resources that are less valuable to me relative to others.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of my Wood (since it's relatively abundant and not the most valuable) for something more valuable. However, I'll first inspect my resources again.\n\nLet's make an initial offer. I'll offer 4 Wood (which is 4 * 8 = 32 in value) for 1 Ore (which is 1 * 37 = 37 in value), gaining 5 in value if accepted.\n\nMy offer: `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis is a simple and straightforward offer that potentially increases my total value.\n\nLet's see how the opponent responds. \n\nSince this is the start, I will send the offer and wait for the response.\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]`",
