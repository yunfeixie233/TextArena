      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to strategically decide which resources to trade and what to request in return. Let's analyze the current situation:\n\n1. **[Wheat] Qty: 6, Value: 5** - Low value, might be a candidate for trade if it's not crucial.\n2. **[Wood] Qty: 7, Value: 11** - Moderate value.\n3. **[Sheep] Qty: 19, Value: 18** - High quantity, moderate value.\n4. **[Brick] Qty: 21, Value: 29** - High quantity, high value.\n5. **[Ore] Qty: 10, Value: 40** - Moderate quantity, highest value per unit.\n\nFirst, let's assess what I have and what I might want to achieve. I have a good quantity of Brick and a high-value resource in Ore. My goal should be to either increase the quantity of high-value resources or maintain a good balance.\n\nSince I have a high quantity of Sheep and Brick, and a moderate quantity of Ore, I might consider trading some of my resources to either get more of the highest value resource (Ore) or to get a better overall value.\n\nLet's start by making an offer that could potentially increase my total value. I have a lot of Brick (Value: 29) and could potentially trade some for Ore (Value: 40) if possible.\n\n### Turn 1 Offer\n'[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore]' is a potential start. This means I'm offering 5 Brick (total value of 145) for 2 Ore (total value of 80). While this seems disadvantageous at first glance, it's essential to consider the value difference and the potential for negotiation.\n\nHowever, a more balanced approach might be needed. Let's rethink this:\n- I'm willing to give up some Brick or Sheep for more Ore because Ore has a higher value.\n\nLet's make a more balanced offer that considers the quantity and value.\n\n### Alternative Offer for Turn 1\n'[Offer: 3 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]' could be a negotiation starter. Here, I'm offering 3 Brick (Value: 87) and 2 Sheep (Value: 36), totaling a value of 123, in exchange for 2 Ore (Value: 80). This is still not ideal but is a step towards negotiation.\n\nHowever, let's directly go with a simpler and potentially more acceptable offer.\n\n### Chosen Action for Turn 1\n'[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' is a straightforward offer. I'm giving up 4 Sheep (Value: 72) to gain 1 Ore (Value: 40). This is not ideal but let's start the negotiation.\n\n### Action\n'[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'",

      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the current state of resources and the game's progress.\nThe player starts with: Wheat (Qty: 6, Value: 5), Wood (Qty: 7, Value: 11), Sheep (Qty: 19, Value: 18), Brick (Qty: 21, Value: 29), Ore (Qty: 10, Value: 40). The game has progressed with trades made and rejected.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the trades made so far.\n1. Player 0 offered 5 Brick for 2 Ore, which was rejected.\n2. Player 0 then offered 2 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Ore, which was accepted. So, the player's resources changed: Wheat (Qty: 4), Wood (Qty: 6), Ore (Qty: 11).\n3. Player 0 offered 4 Brick for 2 Sheep, which was rejected.\n\n## Step 3: Update the current resources after the last accepted trade.\nAfter the accepted trade (2 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Ore), the resources are:\n- Wheat: 6 - 2 = 4\n- Wood: 7 - 1 = 6\n- Sheep: 19\n- Brick: 21\n- Ore: 10 + 1 = 11\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the current resources and their values.\nCurrent resources and values:\n- Wheat: Qty: 4, Value: 5 (Total: 20)\n- Wood: Qty: 6, Value: 11 (Total: 66)\n- Sheep: Qty: 19, Value: 18 (Total: 342)\n- Brick: Qty: 21, Value: 29 (Total: 609)\n- Ore: Qty: 11, Value: 40 (Total: 440)\nTotal value = 20 + 66 + 342 + 609 + 440 = 1477\n\n## Step 5: Consider potential trades based on the current state and the goal to increase total value.\nTo increase the total value, we should look for trades that give us higher value resources or reduce the quantity of lower value resources. Given the values: Ore (40) > Brick (29) > Sheep (18) > Wood (11) > Wheat (5), we should try to get more Ore or reduce the lower-value resources.\n\n## Step 6: Identify potential trades.\nSince Ore is the most valuable, we should try to get more Ore. Other players might have resources we need or might be willing to trade for what we have. We can offer resources like Wheat, Wood, Sheep, or Brick to get Ore.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a trade offer.\nLet's consider offering some Brick (since we have a lot and it's valuable but less than Ore) for Ore. We have 21 Brick, and offering a smaller quantity might be more acceptable.\n\n## Step 8: Decide on a specific trade offer.\nOffering 3 Brick for 1 Ore could be a reasonable trade since 3 Brick = 3 * 29 = 87, and 1 Ore = 40. However, we need to consider if the other player would accept this. Let's adjust our strategy to make it more appealing.\n\n## Step 9: Adjust the trade offer based on the game's dynamics.\nConsidering our last rejected offer was 4 Brick for 2 Sheep, and we have plenty of Brick, we could try offering something that includes other resources or adjust the quantity. However, since our last offer for Ore was rejected, we might need to adjust our strategy.\n\n## Step 10: Make a new trade offer.\nLet's offer 2 Brick, 1 Wood for 1 Ore. Here, we're giving away resources worth (2*29) + (1*11) = 58 + 11 = 69 for 1 Ore worth 40. This isn't a good trade for us as it's not beneficial. Let's reconsider.\n\n## Step 11: Reconsider the trade offer.\nLet's directly offer resources for Ore. How about offering 2 Sheep for 1 Ore? 2 Sheep = 2 * 18 = 36, which is less than the value of 1 Ore (40). This could be a good trade.\n\n## Step 12: Formulate the trade offer in the required format.\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]}$",

      "response": "### Current State of Resources\n\nAfter the last transaction:\n\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 4    Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 6    Value: 11\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 17   Value: 18\n- [Brick]   Qty: 16   Value: 29\n- [Ore]     Qty: 11   Value: 40\n\n### Total Value of Resources\n\nTo calculate the total value, we multiply the quantity of each resource by its value and sum these products.\n\nTotal Value = (4 * 5) + (6 * 11) + (17 * 18) + (16 * 29) + (11 * 40)\nTotal Value = 20 + 66 + 306 + 464 + 440\nTotal Value = 1296\n\n### Previous Transactions and Outcomes\n\n1. **Player 0's first offer:** 5 Brick -> 2 Ore\n   - **Outcome:** Rejected by Player 1.\n\n2. **Player 0's second offer:** 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore\n   - **Outcome:** Accepted by Player 1. This resulted in losing 2 Wheat and 1 Wood but gaining 1 Ore, which is a valuable resource.\n\n3. **Player 0's third offer:** 4 Brick -> 2 Sheep\n   - **Outcome:** Rejected by Player 1.\n\n4. **Player 0's fourth offer:** 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore\n   - **Outcome:** Rejected by Player 1.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n\nGiven that the last offer (2 Sheep -> 1 Ore) was rejected, and considering the current state of resources, the next step should focus on finding a more appealing trade for Player 1. \n\nSince Ore is a highly valued resource, offering something for Ore could be beneficial. However, the quantity and type of resources offered need to be attractive to Player 1.\n\n### New Offer\n\nLet's analyze the resources and propose a new trade that could be more appealing.\n\n1 Ore is worth 40, so offering resources that sum up to a value close to or slightly higher than 40 might be considered fair by Player 1. \n\nGiven the current quantities and values:\n- Offering 1 Brick (Value: 29) and 1 Wood (Value: 11) totals 40, which matches the value of 1 Ore.\n\nThus, a potential new offer could be: \n[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer maintains a fair exchange rate and could be attractive to Player 1.\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
