My most valuable resources are Ore and Brick, followed by Sheep. Wheat and Wood are less valuable. I should aim to trade away less valuable resources for more valuable ones, or trade resources I have in surplus for more of those I value highly.\n\nI have a decent amount of Wheat, Wood, Sheep, and Brick. My Ore quantity is the lowest. I'd ideally like to get more Ore or Brick.\n\nPlayer 0's offer of (3 Sheep, 2 Ore) for (5 Brick, 2 Sheep) is bad because I am giving up high value items (Ore) and getting less value in return, even with the Brick.\n\nI need to propose a counter offer that is beneficial to me. I have a lot of Brick, Sheep, and Wheat. I could offer some of those in exchange for Ore or more valuable Brick.\n\nLet's try to trade away some Wheat or Wood, which are my lowest value items. Let's assume player 0 might be interested in resources they consider less valuable.\n\nI could try to get some Ore.\nOffer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore\nValue of offered items: (5 * 6) + (3 * 10) = 30 + 30 = 60\nValue of requested items: (1 * 32) = 32\nThis makes me lose value. No.\n\nIf I want Ore, I need to offer something of significant value.\nThe current offer from Player 0 involved Sheep and Ore. They seem to value Brick and Sheep.\nLet me try to get some Ore or Brick, offering Wheat, Wood or Sheep.\n\nLet's counter their offer directly to show I'm interested in trading, but not at a loss.\nTheir offer was 3 Sheep, 2 Ore for 5 Brick, 2 Sheep.\nThis implies they want Brick and Sheep. And they are willing to give Sheep and Ore.\n\nI have 13 Brick and 14 Sheep. I'm willing to part with some Sheep if I gain significantly.\nI want more Ore or Brick.\n\nLet's propose something where I give less valuable items and try to get more valuable ones.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of a low-value item for a small quantity of a high-value item?\n\nLet's try offering my surplus Brick for Ore.\nMy Brick value: 22. My Ore value: 32.\nSo 2 Brick (44) for 1 Ore (32) is bad for me. 1 Brick (22) for 1 Ore (32) is good for me.\n\nLet's think about their offer again: 3 Sheep (45) + 2 Ore (64) = 109. They request 5 Brick (110) + 2 Sheep (30) = 140.\nThis is a bad offer for me in terms of value.\n\nI want to gain value.\nI have plenty of Sheep, Brick, Wheat.\nI need more Ore.\n\nHow about I offer Brick and Wheat for Ore?\n[Offer: 3 Brick, 5 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\nValue offered: (3 * 22) + (5 * 6) = 66 + 30 = 96\nValue requested: (2 * 32) = 64\nThis is bad for me. I am giving more value than I receive.\n\nI need to make an offer where I gain value.\nWhat if I offer a small amount of a high value item for a larger amount or a high value item for what I perceive as a good deal?\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (2 * 15) = 30\nValue requested: (1 * 32) = 32\nThis is a small gain for me, and I have plenty of Sheep. It's plausible.\n\nLet's try making my offer closer to their original proposition but more favorable for me.\nThey offered: (3 Sheep, 2 Ore) for (5 Brick, 2 Sheep).\nThey seem to have Ore and Sheep, and want Brick and Sheep.\n\nI have 13 Brick and 14 Sheep.\nI can offer Brick and Sheep.\nLet's offer a quantity of Brick and get Ore.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nValue of Offer: 2 * 22 = 44\nValue of Request: 1 * 32 = 32\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nI need to gain value or at least be even.\nLet's deny their current offer, as it's not good.\nAnd then propose something I want.\n\nI have an abundance of Wheat (16), Sheep (14), and Brick (13).\nI have a low amount of Ore (7).\n\nWhat if I offer low value resources for high value ones?\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue of offer: (6 * 6) + (4 * 10) = 36 + 40 = 76\nValue of request: (1 * 32) = 32\nStill losing value.\n\nI should focus on gaining the most valuable resource: Ore.\nWhat if I offer quantity of low-value item for low quantity of high-value item, aiming for value gain?\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood]\nOffered Value: (3 * 15) + (2 * 6) = 45 + 12 = 57\nRequested Value: (1 * 32) + (1 * 10) = 32 + 10 = 42\nNo, this is a loss.\n\nI need to be very careful with the value calculation.\nI will deny the current offer, as it is completely against my interest.\nThen I will make an offer that benefits me, aiming to exchange some Sheep or Brick for Ore, or exchange some Wheat/Wood for anything that increases my value.\n\nLet's aim to get 1 Ore.\nTo get 1 Ore (32 value), I should offer items with a total value less than 32.\nExample: 2 Wood (20), nope. 3 Wheat (18), nope. 1 Sheep (15), nope.\n1 Brick (22), nope.\n\nThis means to get 1 Ore for less value, I need to bundle lower value items.\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nOffered value: (2 * 10) + (2 * 6) = 20 + 12 = 32\nRequested value: (1 * 32) = 32\nThis is an even trade. It doesn't increase my total value, but it changes my resources to more desirable ones (Ore). This could be acceptable.\n\nLet's try a small gain.\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nOffered value: (1 * 15) + (1 * 10) = 25\nRequested value: (1 * 32) = 32\nThis is a gain of 7! I have 14 Sheep and 9 Wood, so this is feasible. This looks like a good offer.\n\nLet's go with this. It's a clear gain for me in terms of value. I have plenty of Sheep and Wood.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
