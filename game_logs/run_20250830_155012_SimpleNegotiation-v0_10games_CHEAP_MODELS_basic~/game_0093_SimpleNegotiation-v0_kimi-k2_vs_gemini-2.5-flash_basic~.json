I\u2019d like to siphon excess Ore (value 39) for higher-scoring Brick (29) when the ratios are favorable, while not starving myself of Brick.\n\nMy objective: maximise total end-game value of my hand. I believe Player 1 previously refused 4 Ore for 6 Brick, indicating Brick is tight for P1. I\u2019ll test a slightly softer ask, pitching three Ore for a single Brick, then see if P1 counters.\n\n[Offer: 3 Ore -> 1 Brick]",
