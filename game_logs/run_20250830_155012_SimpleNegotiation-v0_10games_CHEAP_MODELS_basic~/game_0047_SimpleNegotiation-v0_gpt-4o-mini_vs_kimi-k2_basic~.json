      "response": "So far, after every successful trade I\u2019ve been making an offer immediately afterwards, looking for more ways to push up my own value.  \nThe last two of my offers were:\n\n1. 5 sheep + 2 brick  \u2192 3 ore + 2 wheat (accepted)  \n2. 3 brick + 3 sheep  \u2192 4 wood + 1 ore  (accepted)\n\nIn both of those, bricks were leaving my hand \u2013 I let 5 bricks go in total.  Right now **I only have 13 brick left**, down from the original **21**.  Brick is my most abundant resource relative to its marginal value (0.17 value per unit remaining), whereas ore already shot up to scarcity\u2013only 10 ore left, each now worth roughly 3.3 base value if I relinquish.\n\nI have to shift direction: **I no longer have an excess of brick to spare**, so I should not be looking for offers that ask me to give away more brick. Instead I should pursue these rationales:\n\n\u2022 Stop bleeding brick until its marginal value rises materially.  \n\u2022 Accumulate more ore if I can, since every lost ore is very expensive now.  \n\u2022 Increase my fine-grained unit counts, e.g. add wood, to give myself flexibility in small-change future trades.\n\nHence my next trade will aim to **get ore back**, **never give more brick away**, and ideally do it in a package where I supply either sheep (of which I still have a tonne) or a second-tier commodity I can spare.\n\nAfter removing the brick-count considerations, my post-acceptance inventory is actually:\n\n- Wheat  5  (value 5)  \n- Wood  12 (value 15)  \n- Sheep 11 (value 12)  \n- Brick 13 (value 15)  \n- Ore   10 (value 22)\n\nThat\u2019s the state I want to act from.\n\nProposal: I offer **3 Sheep and 1 Wood** for **3 Ore**.\n\nTwo sheep worth 2 and one wood worth 1 for three ore worth 9.  \nNet gain on my end: +6 value \u2013 retailing at a high ore premium without sacrificing brick or anything scarce.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 3 Ore]",
