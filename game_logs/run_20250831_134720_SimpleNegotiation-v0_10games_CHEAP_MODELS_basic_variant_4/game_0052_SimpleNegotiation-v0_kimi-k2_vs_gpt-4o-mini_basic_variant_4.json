      "response": "To understand what your next move should be, let\u2019s break down the current situation:\n\n### 1. **Your Current Inventory**\nLet me calculate the total value of your resources:\n- **Wheat**: 15 \u00d7 5 = 75\n- **Wood**: 9 \u00d7 8 = 72\n- **Sheep**: 14 \u00d7 16 = 224\n- **Brick**: 13 \u00d7 20 = 260\n- **Ore**: 14 \u00d7 33 = 462  \n**Total Value = 1,093**\n\n### 2. **Recent Offers**\n- **Player 1** offered you **5 Wheat + 2 Wood** in exchange for **2 Sheep + 2 Brick**.\n  - What you **give**:  \n    - 2 Sheep (2 \u00d7 16 = 32)  \n    - 2 Brick (2 \u00d7 20 = 40) \u2192 **Total 72 value**  \n  - What you **receive**:  \n    - 5 Wheat (5 \u00d7 5 = 25)  \n    - 2 Wood (2 \u00d7 8 = 16) \u2192 **Total 41 value**  \n\nThis trade is **heavily in their favor**; you'd lose 31 value. **You already denied**, which is correct.\n\n### 3. **Adjust Your Strategy**\nYou're rejecting because the trades offered so far **undervalue your goods**. To win, you must **secure favorable exchanges** where you trade **lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood)** for **higher-value ones (Sheep, Brick, Ore)**.\n\n### 4. **Next Move**\nSince the last offer was bad for you, **counter with a fairer trade** that benefits you:\nYou don\u2019t need Brick (you have 13), and low-value Wheat/Wood are expendable. **Offer a trade where you give excess low-value goods for higher-value ones**.\n\n**Propose for Turn 9:**\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Brick -> 3 Sheep, 1 Ore]  \n- **You give** (8\u00d75 + 3\u00d720) = 40 + 60 = **100**  \n- **You receive** (3\u00d716 + 33) = 48 + 33 = **81**  \nThey're short 19 value, but Sheep/Ore are high-priority. This may prompt negotiation.\n\nAdjust if needed, but **project strength**\u2014they need to sweeten offers.",
