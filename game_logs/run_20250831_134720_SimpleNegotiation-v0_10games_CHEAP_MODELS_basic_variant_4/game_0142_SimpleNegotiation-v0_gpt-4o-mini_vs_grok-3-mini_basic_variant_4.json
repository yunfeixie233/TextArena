      "response": "Given the previous trade offers and rejections, and considering your current resources, here's how you can proceed with a new trade offer:\n\n**Current Resources:**\n- Wheat: 8 \n- Wood: 24 \n- Sheep: 13 \n- Brick: 12 \n- Ore: 19 \n\nIt seems that both players are looking for resources that the other has, but so far, the trade offers have not been successful. Since Player 1 has offered 1 Ore for 3 Sheep and 2 Wood, and after rejecting such offers, it's important to make a strategic move. \n\n**New Offer to Player 1:**\nYou can try to offer a more appealing combination that balances your needs with what you have:\n\n**New Trade Offer:**\n[Offer: 6 Wood, 4 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer gives Player 1 resources they might find valuable while giving you Brick and Ore, which have higher values and might contribute positively to overall resource value. \n\nMake this offer and see how Player 1 responds.",
