      "response": "After reviewing the trades and current resources, I recognize that gaining more Ore (value 38) significantly boosts my total value. Previously, Player 1 accepted trading 2 Ore for 3 Sheep and 3 Wood, which netted me a +10 value gain in my valuation. With Sheep at 8 and Wood at 17, I can afford this trade again without depleting critical resources. It also aligns with Player 1's earlier acceptance pattern, making it a favorable approach. This trade offers mutual familiarity and ensures continued value growth.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
