Thus, trading Wheat or Wood for any other resource could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a trade offer based on the analysis.\nLet's consider offering Wheat or Wood.

However, we need to be realistic about what Player 0 might have and be willing to trade.\n\n## Step 6: Make a trade offer.\nConsidering the high value of Ore, let's offer some Wood (since Wheat is very low in value and we have a decent amount of Wood) for Ore.
