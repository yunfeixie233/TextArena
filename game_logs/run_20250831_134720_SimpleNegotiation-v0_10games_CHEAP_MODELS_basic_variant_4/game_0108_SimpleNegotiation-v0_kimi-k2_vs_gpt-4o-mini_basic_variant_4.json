      "response": "### Thought Process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Current Situation**: First, let's analyze the current resources and their values to determine which resources are more valuable and which are less valuable. This will help in deciding what to offer and what to request.\n\n   - **Wheat**: 21 units, value 6 (total value: 126)\n   - **Wood**: 11 units, value 8 (total value: 88)\n   - **Sheep**: 20 units, value 17 (total value: 340)\n   - **Brick**: 19 units, value 28 (total value: 532)\n   - **Ore**: 5 units, value 36 (total value: 180)\n\n   **Total value of all resources**: 126 + 88 + 340 + 532 + 180 = 1266.\n\n2. **Identifying Valuable vs. Less Valuable Resources**: \n   - **Low-value resources**: Wheat (6), Wood (8), Sheep (17).\n   - **High-value resources**: Brick (28), Ore (36).\n\n   Our goal is to increase the total value of our resources. This generally means:\n   - Trading away low-value resources for high-value resources.\n   - Being willing to trade more quantity of low-value resources for fewer high-value ones, provided the trade increases total value.\n\n3. **Assessing Optional Trades**:\n   - Since we have a lot of low-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep), we can offer these in exchange for Brick or Ore.\n   - For example, offering 3 Sheep (51 value) for 1 Ore (36 value) is not increasing total value (since 51 > 36). Instead, we need to offer a combination that is favorable.\n\n4. **Finding Favorable Trade Offers**:\n   - Let's see how much of low-value resources we can give for high-value ones to increase total value.\n   - For example, offering 2 Sheep (34) and 1 Wheat (6) for 1 Ore (36) is neutral (34 + 6 = 40 vs. 36). Not favorable.\n   - Offering 1 Sheep (17) + 1 Wheat (6) for 1 Brick (28): 17 + 6 = 23 vs. 28. This increases value by 5.\n   - Offering 1 Sheep (17) + 1 Wood (8) for 1 Brick (28): 17 + 8 = 25 vs. 28. Increases value by 3.\n\n   The best simple trade is to offer 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat for 1 Brick or 1 Ore. However, we also have quantities to consider.\n\n5. **Making a Balanced Offer**:\n   - To maximize value gain, we can offer multiple low-value resources for high-value ones. For example:\n     - 3 Sheep (51) + 2 Wheat (12) for 2 Brick (56): 51 + 12 = 63 vs. 56. This decreases total value by 7. Not good.\n     - 3 Sheep (51) + 2 Wheat (12) for 2 Ore (72): 51 + 12 = 63 vs. 72. This increases total value by 9. This is good.\n\n6. **Refining the Offer**:\n   - The above offer (3 Sheep + 2 Wheat for 2 Ore) seems favorable as it increases total value by 9 (from 63 to 72).\n   - However, we might balance the quantities better. For example:\n     - 3 Sheep + 2 Ore (low Ore, high Sheep) for 5 Brick + 2 Sheep: This seems arbitrary. Let's calculate:\n       - Offered: 3*17 + 2*36 = 51 + 72 = 123.\n       - Requested: 5*28 + 2*17 = 140 + 34 = 174.\n       - This is not a good trade for us (123 vs. 174, we lose value).\n\n   Instead, a simpler and more balanced offer:\n   - 4 Sheep (68) + 1 Wheat (6) for 3 Brick (84): 68 + 6 = 74 vs. 84. Increases value by 10. This is better.\n\n7. **Choosing the Best Offer**:\n   - The best simple trade is to offer units where the total offered value is slightly less than the requested, ensuring we gain. For example:\n     - 5 Sheep (85) + 2 Wheat (12) for 3 Ore (108): 85 + 12 = 97 vs. 108. Increases value by 11. This seems optimal.\n\n### Final Offer:\nAfter careful calculation, the following offer maximizes value gain:\n- Offer 5 Sheep (85) and 2 Wheat (12) for 3 Ore (108). This increases total value by 11 (97 to 108).\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 3 Ore]",
