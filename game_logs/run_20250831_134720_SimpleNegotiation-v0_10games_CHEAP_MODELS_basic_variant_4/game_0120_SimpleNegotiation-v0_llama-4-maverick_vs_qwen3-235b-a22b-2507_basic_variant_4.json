The total value we're offering is 25 + 72 = 97, and we're requesting resources worth 60.

Given that the last two offers were rejected and both were seeking Sheep, it might be beneficial to either offer something of potentially higher value to Player 1 or to consider a different resource.\n\nLet's analyze the potential value change with the current resources and think about a new offer.\n\n### Potential Trade Offer\n\nTo increase the total value, we need to think about what resources we can offer that might be valuable to Player 1 and what we can request in return that would be of higher value to us.\n\n#### New Offer:\nWe currently have a surplus of Wheat and have used some Wood and Brick in previous offers. Ore is highly valued, but we should be cautious about giving it away. Let's consider an offer that includes resources we have in relative abundance or those that are less critical to our current total value.\n\nLet's make a new offer: \n- Offered items: 4 Wheat, 2 Brick (Resources we have and might be less critical or surplus)\n- Requested items: 3 Sheep (Still a valuable resource we need more of, as indicated by our previous offers)\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Brick -> 3 Sheep]`\n\n### Action\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Brick -> 3 Sheep]`\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds to this new offer.",

If accepted, Player 0 will give away 5 Wheat (5*5 = 25) and 2 Brick (2*21 = 42), totaling 67 value, and receive 3 Sheep (3*15 = 45) in return. This results in a net loss of 22 value.\n   \n4. **Decision:**\n   - Given that Player 1 is willing to give 3 Sheep for 5 Wheat and 2 Brick, it seems they value Sheep more than the resources they're offering. However, the offer isn't very favorable for Player 0 due to the negative value difference.\n   - Since the task is to increase the total value of resources and considering Player 1's offer results in a net loss, it's not beneficial to accept it as is.\n\n5. **Counteroffer or New Offer:**\n   - Let's consider making a counteroffer or a new offer. Player 0 could try to renegotiate the terms or propose a different trade.\n   - For example, offering fewer resources for the same 3 Sheep or asking for more resources in return.\n\nGiven the history and the last offer from Player 1, a potential counteroffer could be to adjust the terms to be more favorable. Let's consider:\n- **[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep]**: This reduces the total value given away by Player 0.\n\nLet's propose this counteroffer.\n\n**Action:** [Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep]",

      "response": "### Turn Analysis and Next Steps\n\n#### Current Resources:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 16   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 24   Value: 9\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 7    Value: 15\n- [Brick]   Qty: 15   Value: 21\n- [Ore]     Qty: 11   Value: 40\n\n#### Previous Actions and Outcomes:\n1. Initial Offer: 5 Wheat, 8 Wood -> 4 Sheep (Rejected)\n2. Second Offer: 7 Wood, 3 Brick -> 4 Sheep (Rejected)\n3. Third Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Brick -> 3 Sheep (Rejected)\n4. Counter Offer from Player 1: 3 Sheep -> 5 Wheat, 2 Brick (Rejected)\n5. Fourth Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep (Rejected)\n6. Counter Offer from Player 1: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 4 Wheat, 1 Brick (Accepted)\n\n#### Analysis:\n- The total value of resources before the game started: (20*5) + (24*9) + (5*15) + (16*21) + (10*40) = 100 + 216 + 75 + 336 + 400 = 1127\n- After accepting the last offer: (16*5) + (24*9) + (7*15) + (15*21) + (11*40) = 80 + 216 + 105 + 315 + 440 = 1156\n- The total value has increased from 1127 to 1156.\n\n#### Strategy for Next Turns:\n1. **Assess Current Resources**: We have 16 Wheat, 24 Wood, 7 Sheep, 15 Brick, and 11 Ore.\n2. **Identify Valuable Resources**: Ore is the most valuable resource per unit, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n3. **Determine What to Acquire or Maintain**: It is beneficial to acquire more Ore or maintain the current level of valuable resources while trying to get rid of less valuable ones.\n\n#### Next Offer:\nTo improve our resource value, let's consider offering some of the less valuable resources for more valuable ones. We can offer some Wheat and/or Wood for Ore or possibly Brick if the offer is reasonable.\n\nConsidering the current quantities and values, a potential offer could be:\n- Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick (This is just an example and might need adjustments based on Player 1's potential responses and our needs)\n\nLet's formulate a more suitable offer:\n```plaintext\n[Offer: 8 Wood -> 2 Ore]\n```\nOr if we want to simplify and directly target a resource:\n```plaintext\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n```\n\nLet's go with: \n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\n### Action:\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
