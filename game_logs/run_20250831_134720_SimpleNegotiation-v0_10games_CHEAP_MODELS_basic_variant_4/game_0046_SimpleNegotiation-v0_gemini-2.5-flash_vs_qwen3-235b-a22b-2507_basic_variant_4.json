I have a lot of Brick and Wheat, which are less valuable than Ore. I also have less Ore than other resources. I will try to trade some of my lower value resources for Ore.\n\nOffer: I will offer 4 Brick and 4 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n\nProposed trade:\n*   **Offered Resources:** 4 Brick, 4 Wheat\n*   **Requested Resources:** 1 Ore\n\nValue calculation for proposed trade:\n*   Value of offered resources: (4 * 24) + (4 * 5) = 96 + 20 = 116\n*   Value of requested resources: (1 * 39) = 39\n\nMy goal is to increase my total resource value, so I want to get more value than I give away. This offer gives away 116 value for 39 value, so this is not a good trade for me, and I wouldn't make this offer.\n\nI will try again. I want to acquire more valuable resources (Ore) by giving away less valuable resources (Wheat, Brick, Wood, Sheep).\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nI have a lot of Sheep and Brick, which are moderately to highly valued. I have less Ore. I will try to trade Sheep and Brick for Ore.\n\nOffer: I will offer 2 Sheep and 1 Brick for 1 Ore.\n\n*   **Offered Resources:** 2 Sheep, 1 Brick\n*   **Requested Resources:** 1 Ore\n\nValue calculation for proposed trade:\n*   Value of offered resources: (2 * 16) + (1 * 24) = 32 + 24 = 56\n*   Value of requested resources: (1 * 39) = 39\n\nThis trade also makes me lose value. My goal is to gain value.\n\nLet's try to get rid of some of my less valued resources, like Wheat and Wood, to gain more valuable resources.\n\nOffer: I will offer 8 Wheat and 5 Wood for 1 Ore.\n\n*   **Offered Resources:** 8 Wheat, 5 Wood\n*   **Requested Resources:** 1 Ore\n\nValue calculation for proposed trade:\n*   Value of offered resources: (8 * 5) + (5 * 10) = 40 + 50 = 90\n*   Value of requested resources: (1 * 39) = 39\n\nThis still results in a loss for me. I need to get more value than I give.\nMy highest value resource is Ore (39). My lowest is Wheat (5).\n\nIf I want to get Ore, I have to offer enough to make it enticing.\nMaybe I can offer a combination of resources.\n\nI have 24 Wheat (value 5), 10 Wood (value 10), 16 Sheep (value 16), 25 Brick (value 24), 7 Ore (value 39).\n\nLet's rethink my strategy. The first offer I made was offering all my resources for all my resources. That's essentially no trade, and player 1 rejected it. I need to make a trade that is favorable to me, meaning the value of what I receive is greater than the value of what I offer.\n\nI have an abundance of Brick (25) and Wheat (24), which are lower in value compared to Ore.\nI also have a decent amount of Sheep (16) and Wood (10).\n\nI will offer a mix of my lower value resources for a higher value resource.\nI want to increase my Ore, as it has the highest value.\n\nHow about I offer 16 Wheat for 1 Ore?\n*   Offered: 16 Wheat (16 * 5 = 80)\n*   Requested: 1 Ore (1 * 39 = 39)\nStill a bad trade for me.\n\nI need to think about what the *other player* might value. If they have a lot of Ore and need other resources, they might accept an offer where I get more value than I give. However, I have no information about their resources or preferences.\n\nMy goal is to increase my total value. So I need to offer less value than I receive.\nLet's try to trade Brick for Ore.\nIf I offer 1 Brick (value 24) for 1 Ore (value 39). This is a good trade for me!\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nBut is that realistic? Player 1 might refuse if it's too one-sided. But I have to try.\nHowever, I have 25 Brick, so trading 1 Brick away is not a problem. I also only have 7 Ore, so gaining more Ore is good.\n\nI will try to get 2 Ore instead.\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick and 1 Sheep for 2 Ore?\n*   Offered: 1 Brick (24) + 1 Sheep (16) = 40\n*   Requested: 2 Ore (2 * 39 = 78)\nThis is a good trade for me! I give up 40 value and get 78 value.\nThis seems like a reasonable offer. I'm taking slightly less valuable goods and trying to get more of the most valuable good.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
