      "response": "### Negotiation Game: Initial Analysis\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 18, Value: 6\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 5, Value: 12\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 23, Value: 12\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 16, Value: 25\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 13, Value: 38\n\n#### Initial Total Value:\nTo understand the initial total value, we calculate:\n- Wheat: 18 * 6 = 108\n- Wood: 5 * 12 = 60\n- Sheep: 23 * 12 = 276\n- Brick: 16 * 25 = 400\n- Ore: 13 * 38 = 494\n\nTotal Value = 108 + 60 + 276 + 400 + 494 = 1338\n\n#### Strategy:\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources through trading. To do this effectively, we need to identify which resources are more valuable and try to acquire more of the highest value resources or resources that are likely to be valuable to the other player but less so to us.\n\n#### Initial Observation:\n1. **Ore** is the most valuable resource per unit, followed by **Brick**.\n2. We have a good quantity of **Sheep**, which is moderately valued.\n\n#### First Turn Strategy:\nTo start, we should look to trade resources that are either less valuable or abundant for us, for resources that are more valuable or scarce. \n\nGiven the current distribution, offering some **Wheat** (the least valuable resource per unit) or possibly **Sheep** (if we can get a good deal) could be a good start.\n\nLet's make an offer that could potentially benefit both parties. We can offer some **Wheat** in exchange for a resource that might be less abundant for us but is still relatively valuable.\n\n### Action for Turn 1:\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis offer is made with the assumption that **Brick** is a valuable resource, and giving away 5 **Wheat** (total value of 30) for 1 **Brick** (value of 25) might not be the best deal, but it's a starting point to initiate trade. Ideally, we would want to negotiate for something more valuable. However, let's start by making a reasonable offer and see the response.\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response before proceeding further.",

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the current state of resources and the history of trades.\n\nInitial resources and values:\n- Wheat: 18 (Value: 6) = 108\n- Wood: 5 (Value: 12) = 60\n- Sheep: 23 (Value: 12) = 276\n- Brick: 16 (Value: 25) = 400\n- Ore: 13 (Value: 38) = 494\n\nTotal initial value = 108 + 60 + 276 + 400 + 494 = 1338\n\nAfter the trades:\n1. Offered 5 Wheat, Got 1 Brick:\n   - Wheat: 18 - 5 = 13\n   - Brick: 16 + 1 = 17\n   - Value change: -5*6 + 1*25 = -30 + 25 = -5\n\n2. Accepted offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Sheep:\n   - Wheat: 13 + 5 = 18\n   - Sheep: 23 - 2 = 21\n   - Value change: +5*6 - 2*12 = 30 - 24 = +6\n\n3. Rejected offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore (no change)\n\n4. Accepted offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore:\n   - Wheat: 18 + 6 = 24\n   - Ore: 13 - 1 = 12\n   - Value change: +6*6 - 1*38 = 36 - 38 = -2\n\nCurrent resources and values:\n- Wheat: 24 (Value: 6) = 144\n- Wood: 5 (Value: 12) = 60\n- Sheep: 21 (Value: 12) = 252\n- Brick: 17 (Value: 25) = 425\n- Ore: 12 (Value: 38) = 456\n\nTotal current value = 144 + 60 + 252 + 425 + 456 = 1337\n\nNow, analyzing the last offer from Player 1: Offered items: 2 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n- Current Ore: 12, Value: 456\n- If accepted, Ore: 11, Value: 418; Wood: 5 + 2 = 7, Value: 7*12 = 84\n- Value change: -38 + 24 = -14 (loss)\n\nLet's evaluate making a new offer.\n\nTo make a profitable trade, we should look at the resources we have and their values, and think about what we can offer and what we can request.\n\n1. We have a lot of Wheat (24), but its value is relatively low (6). We could potentially offer some Wheat for a higher-value resource.\n2. We have a significant amount of Sheep (21), and their value is moderate (12). We could consider trading some Sheep for resources with higher value.\n3. Brick (17) is also valuable (25), and we've just gained one. We might not want to give it up easily.\n4. Ore (12) is very valuable (38), and we've just lost one. We should be cautious about giving up more Ore.\n\nConsidering the history and current state, a potential trade could involve offering some Wheat or Sheep for Ore or Brick, as they are of higher value.\n\nLet's think about making an offer:\n- Offering 4 Wheat (Value: 24) for 1 Ore (Value: 38) could be beneficial since we gain value: -24 + 38 = +14.\n- An offer like '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' might be attractive.\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
