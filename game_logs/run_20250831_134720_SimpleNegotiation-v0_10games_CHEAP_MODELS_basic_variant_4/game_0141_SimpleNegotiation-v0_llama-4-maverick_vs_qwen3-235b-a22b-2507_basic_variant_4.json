      "response": "### Negotiation Game Initial Analysis\n\nAs Player 0, I will analyze the initial resources and their values to determine the best course of action for trading.\n\n#### Initial Resources and Values:\n\n- Wheat: Qty: 8, Value: 6\n- Wood: Qty: 24, Value: 11\n- Sheep: Qty: 19, Value: 17\n- Brick: Qty: 8, Value: 24\n- Ore: Qty: 15, Value: 37\n\n#### Total Initial Value:\nTo calculate the total initial value, we need to multiply the quantity of each resource by its value and sum these products.\n\n- Wheat: 8 * 6 = 48\n- Wood: 24 * 11 = 264\n- Sheep: 19 * 17 = 323\n- Brick: 8 * 24 = 192\n- Ore: 15 * 37 = 555\n\nTotal Initial Value = 48 + 264 + 323 + 192 + 555 = 1382\n\n#### Strategy:\nTo increase the total value of resources, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or acquire more valuable resources.\n\n#### First Turn:\nLet's examine potential trades. We have a good quantity of Sheep and Ore, which are relatively valuable. We could consider offering some of our less valuable resources or those in surplus for more valuable ones.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some Wood (Value: 11) for Brick (Value: 24) or Ore (Value: 37), as these are more valuable.\n\nLet's make an offer: `[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Brick]`\n\nThis offer aims to exchange 5 Wood (total value = 5 * 11 = 55) for 2 Brick (total value = 2 * 24 = 48). While the immediate value isn't significantly increased, having more Brick could be beneficial. However, let's adjust our strategy to aim for a more valuable resource.\n\nLet's reconsider and make a more valuable offer: `[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis involves offering 4 Wood (4 * 11 = 44) and 2 Wheat (2 * 6 = 12) for 1 Ore (1 * 37 = 37). The total offered value is 56, and we're requesting a resource worth 37. This isn't ideal, so let's adjust.\n\nA potentially better offer could be: `[Offer: 2 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n\nHere, we're offering 2 Wheat (2 * 6 = 12) and 3 Wood (3 * 11 = 33) for 1 Brick (1 * 24 = 24). The total value offered is 45 for a resource worth 24. Again, not ideal.\n\nLet's directly aim for the most valuable resource: `[Offer: 8 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]`\n\nWe're offering 8 Wheat (8 * 6 = 48) and 5 Wood (5 * 11 = 55), totaling 103, for 2 Ore (2 * 37 = 74). This is not a good trade for us since we're offering more value than we're getting.\n\n#### Adjusted Offer for Turn 1:\nLet's make a reasonable initial offer that could be beneficial: `[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]`\n\nHere, we're offering 3 Sheep (3 * 17 = 51) for 1 Ore (37) and 1 Brick (24), totaling 61. This trade increases our total value.\n\nLet's proceed with this offer.\n\n### Response:\n`[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]`",

Offered 5 Wood for 2 Brick (rejected)\n2. Offered 4 Sheep for 2 Ore (rejected)\n\nLet's analyze the previous offers:\n- The first offer was to exchange 5 Wood (Value: 11 each) for 2 Brick (Value: 24 each). The total value given was 55, and the total value requested was 48, which might be why it was rejected as it didn't favor the opponent in terms of value.\n- The second offer was to exchange 4 Sheep (Value: 17 each) for 2 Ore (Value: 37 each). The total value given was 68, and the total value requested was 74. This was a slightly better deal for the opponent, but still, it was rejected.\n\nConsidering the game's objective to increase the total value of my resources, I'll make a new offer that might be more appealing or strategic.\n\nI'll offer: [Offer:6 Ore -> 2 Brick,1 Sheep]\n\nThis means I'll give 6 Ore (Value: 37 each, total value = 222) in exchange for 2 Brick (Value: 24 each, total value = 48) and 1 Sheep (Value: 17). The total value I'm giving is 222, and the total value I'm requesting is 65. This is not a favorable deal for me as it stands because I'm giving more value than I'm getting.\n\nLet's adjust the strategy: Since my last offer was not very favorable, I'll try to make a more balanced or slightly favorable offer to me.\n\nLet's try: [Offer:3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\n\nThis means I'll give 3 Sheep (Value: 17 each, total = 51) for 2 Ore (Value: 37 each, total = 74). The total value I'm giving is 51, and the total value I'm getting is 74, which is a positive trade for me.\n\nSo, my next action is: [Offer:3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\n\nLet's see how Player1 responds.",

      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the current state of resources\nThe current resources and their values are:\n- Wheat: 8, Value: 6\n- Wood: 24, Value: 11\n- Sheep: 19, Value: 17\n- Brick: 8, Value: 24\n- Ore: 15, Value: 37\n\n## Step 2: Review the history of trades and offers\nPrevious offers and their outcomes:\n1. Offered 5 Wood for 2 Brick: Rejected\n2. Offered 4 Sheep for 2 Ore: Rejected\n3. Offered 6 Ore for 2 Brick, 1 Sheep: Accepted\n4. Offered 8 Wood for 3 Ore: Rejected\n5. Received an offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Sheep for 8 Wood: Rejected\n6. Offered 4 Sheep for 2 Ore: Rejected\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the current resources after the accepted trade\nAfter the accepted trade (6 Ore for 2 Brick, 1 Sheep):\n- Ore: 15 - 6 = 9\n- Brick: 8 + 2 = 10\n- Sheep: 19 - 1 = 18\nSo, the new quantities are:\n- Wheat: 8\n- Wood: 24\n- Sheep: 18\n- Brick: 10\n- Ore: 9\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the current total value of resources\nCalculate the total value:\n- Wheat: 8 * 6 = 48\n- Wood: 24 * 11 = 264\n- Sheep: 18 * 17 = 306\n- Brick: 10 * 24 = 240\n- Ore: 9 * 37 = 333\nTotal Value = 48 + 264 + 306 + 240 + 333 = 1191\n\n## Step 5: Assess the last offer made by Player 1\nPlayer 1 offered 5 Wheat, 3 Sheep for 8 Wood. This was rejected.\n\n## Step 6: Consider making a new offer based on the current state and history\nTo increase the total value, we should look for trades that give us resources with higher values or more quantity of resources we already have that are valuable.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze potential trades\nGiven the current quantities and values, consider what would be a beneficial trade. We have a significant amount of Wood, Sheep, and some Ore. We could offer some Wood for more valuable resources or try to get more Ore or Brick since they are high in value.\n\n## Step 8: Formulate a new trade offer\nConsidering the values:\n- Offering some Wood (Value: 11) for Ore (Value: 37) or Brick (Value: 24) could be beneficial.\n- We could offer 7 Wood for 2 Ore (since 7*11 = 77 and 2*37 = 74, it's almost a fair trade and could be worth considering if we really need Ore).\n\n## Step 9: Decide on the trade offer\nLet's offer 7 Wood for 3 Ore (3*37 = 111, 7*11 = 77, so we gain value).\n\n## Step 10: Format the trade offer according to the game's special tokens\nThe offer is: [Offer: 7 Wood -> 3 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 7 Wood -> 3 Ore]}$",
