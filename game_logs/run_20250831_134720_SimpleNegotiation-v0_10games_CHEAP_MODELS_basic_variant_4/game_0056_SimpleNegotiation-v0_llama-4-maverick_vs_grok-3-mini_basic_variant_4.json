      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I should analyze the current situation and decide on the best course of action for the first turn.\n\nCurrently, I have:\n- Wheat: 11 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 22 (Value: 11)\n- Sheep: 13 (Value: 14)\n- Brick: 16 (Value: 25)\n- Ore: 18 (Value: 37)\n\nTotal value = (11 * 6) + (22 * 11) + (13 * 14) + (16 * 25) + (18 * 37) \nTotal value = 66 + 242 + 182 + 400 + 666 \nTotal value = 1556\n\nTo decide on a trade, I need to consider what I have in abundance and what I lack but could be valuable. Since the values of the resources are given, I should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or at least maintain or slightly increase my total value if possible.\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n\n1. **Ore (Value: 37)** is the most valuable resource I have, so I should be cautious about trading it away.\n2. **Brick (Value: 25)** is also quite valuable.\n3. **Sheep (Value: 14)** and **Wood (Value: 11)** are moderately valued.\n4. **Wheat (Value: 6)** is the least valuable.\n\nA potential strategy could involve trading some of my less valuable resources for more valuable ones. However, without knowing what the other player has, I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nLet's consider a possible trade:\n- I have a lot of Wood (22) and some Wheat (11), which are relatively less valuable. \n- If I can trade some of these for resources that are more valuable or at least maintain my current value, it could be beneficial.\n\nFor the first turn, let's make an offer that trades some of my less valuable resources for something potentially more valuable. For instance, let's try to trade some Wheat and Wood for Ore or Brick, as they are more valuable.\n\nHere's a possible trade:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]'\n\nLet's calculate if this trade makes sense:\n- I'm offering: 5 Wheat (5*6 = 30) + 3 Wood (3*11 = 33) = 63 total value.\n- I'm requesting: 1 Ore (1*37 = 37) + 1 Brick (1*25 = 25) = 62 total value.\n\nThis trade is almost neutral in terms of value, but it slightly decreases my total value. Let's try to negotiate something slightly better or more beneficial.\n\nAfter reconsideration, here is my first action:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]'\n\nThis offer gives away: 4 Wheat (4*6 = 24) + 2 Wood (2*11 = 22) = 46 total value.\nAnd requests: 1 Brick (1*25 = 25) \n\nLet's see how the opponent responds. \n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]'",

Let's analyze the potential trades based on the resources you have and the offer made by Player 1.\n\nGiven that Player 1 is willing to give 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, it implies they might need Ore or value Ore highly. You could potentially make a counteroffer that involves Ore but try to get a better deal.\n\n## Step 1: Evaluate Your Resources for Potential Trades\nYou have a surplus of resources with varying values. To increase your total value, you need to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value.\n\n## Step 2: Consider Counteroffering Based on Player 1's Offer\nSince Player 1 is interested in Ore, you could counteroffer with Ore but try to negotiate for something of higher or comparable value.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a Counteroffer\nLet's consider offering 1 Ore (as they requested) but ask for something more valuable in return. Since Brick has a high value (25), and you already have a considerable amount of it, asking for Brick could be a good strategy.\n\n## Step 4: Decide on the Counteroffer Details\nYou could counteroffer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick (since Brick is valuable and you have a decent amount of it already).\n\nThe value of 1 Ore is 37, and the value of 1 Brick is 25. This isn't a great deal for you since you're losing value. However, it's better than their initial offer.\n\n## Step 5: Consider Alternative Counteroffers\nAnother option is to counteroffer with a different quantity or resource. For instance, you could offer less Ore or something else they might need, and ask for more in return.\n\nLet's directly formulate a counteroffer based on the given situation.\n\n## Step 6: Making the Counteroffer\nGiven that you need to make a more valuable trade, let's directly propose: \n'[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]'.\n\nThis translates to: '[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]' = '[Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]' = '[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]'.\n\nLet's check the values:\n- 1 Ore = 37\n- 3 Brick = 3 * 25 = 75\n\nThis trade increases your resource value.\n\nThe final action is: '[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]'.",

      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\n#### Current Resources:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 11   Value: 6\n- [Wood]    Qty: 22   Value: 11\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 13   Value: 14\n- [Brick]   Qty: 17   Value: 25 (Updated after accepting 1 Brick for 1 Ore)\n- [Ore]     Qty: 17   Value: 37 (Updated after trading 1 Ore for 1 Brick)\n\n#### Previous Turns Summary:\n1. Player 0 offered 5 Wheat, 3 Wood for 1 Ore, 1 Brick. Rejected.\n2. Player 1 offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore. Rejected by Player 0.\n3. Player 0 offered 1 Ore for 3 Brick. Rejected.\n4. Player 1 offered 1 Brick for 1 Ore. Accepted by Player 0.\n5. Player 1 offered 1 Brick for 1 Ore. Rejected by Player 0.\n6. Player 1 offered 3 Wood for 1 Ore. Rejected by Player 0.\n7. Player 0 offered 2 Ore for 3 Brick. Rejected.\n8. Player 1 offered 1 Brick for 1 Ore. \n\n#### Analysis:\n- The last offer from Player 1 was 1 Brick for 1 Ore. Given the previous successful trade where 1 Brick was gained for 1 Ore, it seems beneficial to accept trades that give more Brick for Ore or at least maintain the ratio if other resources are involved.\n- The value of Brick is 25 and Ore is 37. Trading 1 Ore for 1 Brick is not favorable due to the loss in total value (37 for 25).\n- We should look for opportunities that either increase the quantity of higher-value resources or gain resources that can be used for future beneficial trades.\n\n#### Decision:\nGiven the current state and the last offer, I will reject the offer because it results in a decrease in total resource value.\n\n### Action:\n[Deny]\n\n### Reasoning for Next Turn:\nFor the next turn, we should consider making a new offer or waiting for Player 1's next move. Since our last offer was rejected and the current offer from Player 1 is not favorable, we need to strategize:\n- We can offer resources that are abundant or of lower value to us in exchange for resources that are scarce or of higher value.\n- A potential strategy could involve offering some Wheat or Wood (lower value resources) for Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's prepare a new offer for the next turn.\n\n### New Offer for Next Turn:\nConsidering the values and quantities, offering some Wood (Value: 11) for Brick (Value: 25) could be a good strategy. \n\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
