This would have increased my total value by 3 units. Player 1 rejected the offer. Player 1 has not made any offers yet. Player 1 currently has 0 active offers.\n\nMy objective is to increase the total value of my resources. I need to make offers that are beneficial to me, and potentially attractive to Player 1. Since Player 1 rejected my previous offer, I should try a different combination or adjust the quantities.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat, which has the lowest value per unit. I'd like to get rid of some Wheat or Wood. I also have a lot of Ore which has a high value.\n\nLet's try to get some higher-value resources for a combination of lower-value ones.\nI'm going to offer a mix of lower-value resources for a smaller quantity of higher-value resources.\n\nMy current resources:\n* Wheat: 18 (Value: 6)\n* Wood: 9 (Value: 8)\n* Sheep: 8 (Value: 18)\n* Brick: 9 (Value: 24)\n* Ore: 12 (Value: 37)\n\nOffer: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick\nValue of offered resources: (6 * 6) + (3 * 8) = 36 + 24 = 60\nValue of requested resources: (2 * 24) = 48\nThis trade would decrease my total value by 12. This is not good. I should aim for an increase in value.\n\nLet's rethink this. I need to get more value than I give.\n\nHow about something that uses Wheat, as I have the most of it.\nOffer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Sheep\nValue of offered resources: 10 * 6 = 60\nValue of requested resources: 2 * 18 = 36\nThis is also losing value for me.\n\nThe last offer of 18 Wheat for 3 Ore was a marginal gain (3 value units). Player 1 still rejected it, so maybe Player 1 doesn't want Wheat or doesn't have enough Ore to spare. Or Player 1 wants a bigger gain for themselves.\n\nLet's try to get rid of Wheat for something with a higher unit value, even if it's less qty.\nIf I offer 12 Wheat (value 72), I could ask for 2 Brick (value 48) - still a loss for me.\n\nPerhaps offering a slightly more balanced trade where I still profit.\nOr I can offer a combination of my 'cheaper' items for one of their higher ones.\n\nMaybe Player 1 needs Wood or Wheat. I have abundant Wheat.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat for Ore again, but perhaps a smaller quantity of Wheat.\nOffer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore\nValue of offered: 6 * 6 = 36\nValue of requested: 1 * 37 = 37\nThis means I gain 1 value. This is a very small gain, but it is a gain, and may be attractive if Player 1 needs Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
