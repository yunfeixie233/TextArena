      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to analyze the current situation and determine the best course of action.\n\nInitially, I have:\n- Wheat: 19 units, Value: 6\n- Wood: 20 units, Value: 11\n- Sheep: 11 units, Value: 14\n- Brick: 10 units, Value: 30\n- Ore: 13 units, Value: 32\n\nThe total value of my resources is calculated as follows:\n- Wheat: 19 * 6 = 114\n- Wood: 20 * 11 = 220\n- Sheep: 11 * 14 = 154\n- Brick: 10 * 30 = 300\n- Ore: 13 * 32 = 416\nTotal Value = 114 + 220 + 154 + 300 + 416 = 1204\n\nMy goal is to increase this total value through trades.\n\nFirst, let's identify which resources are potentially overvalued or undervalued relative to others. To do this, we need to compare the values of the resources. The values are already given: Wheat (6), Wood (11), Sheep (14), Brick (30), and Ore (32).\n\nTo make a profitable trade, I should offer resources with lower values and request resources with higher values. Given my current resources, I can look for opportunities to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n\n1. I have a significant amount of Wheat (low value) and Wood (moderate value). Trading these for higher-value resources like Brick or Ore could be beneficial.\n2. I can try to trade some Wheat (Value: 6) for Wood (Value: 11), Sheep (Value: 14), Brick (Value: 30), or Ore (Value: 32) if the terms are favorable.\n\nTo initiate a trade, I should think about what I can offer and what I can request. Since I have a lot of Wheat and Wood, I can consider offering some of these for more valuable resources.\n\nHere's a possible trade:\n- I can offer some Wheat and/or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's start with an offer:\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 5 Brick]'\n\nThis means I am offering 10 units of Wheat and 5 units of Wood in exchange for 5 units of Brick.\n\nThe calculation for this trade is as follows:\n- I'm giving up: (10 * 6) + (5 * 11) = 60 + 55 = 115\n- I'm getting: 5 * 30 = 150\n\nThis trade increases my total value by 35 (150 - 115 = 35), so it's a good trade.\n\nMy action for Turn 1 is: [Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 5 Brick]",

      "response": "Let's analyze the current situation and plan the next move.\n\n**Current Resources:**\n+ [Wheat] Qty:19 - 10 + 0 = 9 Value:6 (since we offered 10 Wheat in the last accepted trade and didn't receive any Wheat)\n   Actual: 9 \n+ [Wood] Qty:20 - 3 - 2 + 3 = 18 (3 Wood was offered in previous trades, 2 in the trade before the last accepted trade, and 3 Wood was received) \n   Actual: 18 \n+ [Sheep] Qty:11 - 4 + 6 = 13 (4 Sheep were offered in a previous trade, and 6 Sheep were received in the last accepted trade)\n   Actual: 13 \n+ [Brick] Qty:10 - 8 + 8 = 10 (8 Brick were received, and 8 Brick were offered)\n   Actual: 10 \n+ [Ore] Qty:13 - 2 = 11 (2 Ore were offered in a previous trade)\n   Actual: 11 \n\nLet's correct the quantities based on the given information and past trades:\n- Initial: Wheat=19, Wood=20, Sheep=11, Brick=10, Ore=13\n- Offered: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood; 8 Wheat, 3 Wood; 2 Wood, 4 Sheep; 10 Wheat, 8 Brick; 5 Wheat, 2 Wood\n- Received: 5 Brick (not received due to rejection), 6 Sheep, 3 Wood, 8 Brick, 4 Sheep\n\nCorrecting based on all trades:\n- Wheat: 19 - (10+8+10+5) = 19 - 33 = -14, so 19 - 10 (last accepted didn't count as it was rejected) = 9, then 9 - 5 = 4 (since we had 9 after the last accepted trade and offered 5 more)\n   Actual: 4 \n- Wood: 20 - (5+3+2+2) + 3 = 20 - 12 + 3 = 11\n   Actual: 11 \n- Sheep: 11 - 4 + 6 = 13, then 13 - 4 = 9 (since we offered 4 Sheep in the last trade)\n   Actual: 9 \n- Brick: 10 + 8 = 18 (since we received 8 Brick and didn't give any in the last accepted trade, but we had offered 8 Brick and 5 Brick in different trades)\n   Actual: We had 10, gave 8, and got 8, so 10 \n- Ore: 13 - 2 = 11\n   Actual: 11 \n\nLet's simplify with the actual changes:\n+ [Wheat] Qty: 4 (offered 10 and 5, and 8 and 10 before, so in total 33, but the game only counts the accepted and the current state) \n+ [Wood] Qty: 11 \n+ [Sheep] Qty: 9 \n+ [Brick] Qty: 10 \n+ [Ore] Qty: 11 \n\n**Turn Number:** Not explicitly stated, but we can infer from the number of trades made.\n\nLet's analyze the last trades and the current state:\n1. We had accepted a trade: Offered items:10 Wheat,8 Brick -> Requested items:6 Sheep,3 Wood. So our Wheat decreased by 10, Brick decreased by 8, Sheep increased by 6, and Wood increased by 3.\n2. Then we made a trade offer that was rejected: Offered items:5 Wheat,2 Wood -> Requested items:4 Sheep. \n\nTo increase the total value, we need to think about what we can offer and what we can request. \n\nSince the last trade we made was accepted, let's examine our current resources and the value associated.\n\n**Current Value:**\n+ [Wheat] Qty:4 Value:6 = 24\n+ [Wood] Qty:11 Value:11 = 121\n+ [Sheep] Qty:9 Value:14 = 126\n+ [Brick] Qty:10 Value:30 = 300\n+ [Ore] Qty:11 Value:32 = 352\n\nTotal Value = 24 + 121 + 126 + 300 + 352 = 923\n\nTo maximize our total value, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value.\n\nConsidering the last accepted trade and the current quantities:\n- We could think about offering some Wheat or Wood (lower value compared to Brick or Ore) to get more valuable resources.\n\nLet's think about making a new trade offer:\n- We can offer some Wheat (since it's relatively less valuable) or Wood.\n\nA potential trade could be: \n[Offer:2 Wheat,2 Wood -> 2 Ore]\n\nLet's check if it's reasonable:\n- We have 4 Wheat, so offering 2 is feasible.\n- We have 11 Wood, so offering 2 is feasible.\n- We have 11 Ore, so giving away 2 is feasible if we get something valuable in return.\n\nHowever, let's directly check the format for the response.\n\nSince Player1 made no new trade offer, we will make a new trade offer.\n\n[Offer:2 Wheat,2 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
