Since [Sheep] is relatively valuable and we are running low, getting more [Sheep] could be beneficial.\n\nLet's make an offer:\n- Offer 4 Wood for 4 Sheep.\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 4 Sheep]`.\n\nLet's check the potential outcome:\n- Before:\n  - [Wood]    Qty: 20   Value: 12\n  - [Sheep]   Qty: 8    Value: 13\n- After the proposed trade:\n  - [Wood]    Qty: 20 - 4 = 16   Value: 12\n  - [Sheep]   Qty: 8 + 4 = 12   Value: 13\n\nChange in value for [Wood]: \\(-4 \\times 12 = -48\\)\nChange in value for [Sheep]: \\(+4 \\times 13 = +52\\)\n\nNet gain: \\(+52 - 48 = +4\\)\n\nThe action is: `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 4 Sheep]`.",

Initially:\n   - Wheat: 14, Value: 6\n   - Wood: 24, Value: 12\n   - Sheep: 8, Value: 13\n   - Brick: 19, Value: 28\n   - Ore: 16, Value: 35\n\n2. After the trades:\n   - First trade: Offered 5 Wheat, 4 Wood -> Received 2 Ore\n     - Wheat: 14 - 5 = 9\n     - Wood: 24 - 4 = 20\n     - Ore: 16 + 2 = 18\n   - Second trade: Offered 4 Wood -> Received 4 Sheep\n     - Wood: 20 - 4 = 16\n     - Sheep: 8 + 4 = 12\n   - Third trade: Offered 4 Wheat -> Received 1 Ore\n     - Wheat: 9 - 4 = 5\n     - Ore: 18 + 1 = 19\n   - Fourth trade: Offered 2 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> Requested 1 Ore (Rejected)\n     - No change because the offer was rejected.\n     - Wheat: 5\n     - Sheep: 12\n     - Ore: 19\n\nSo, the current state is:\n- Wheat: 5, Value: 6\n- Wood: 16, Value: 12\n- Sheep: 12, Value: 13\n- Brick: 19, Value: 28\n- Ore: 19, Value: 35\n\n### Calculating Total Value\n\nLet's calculate the total value of the resources:\n- Wheat: 5 * 6 = 30\n- Wood: 16 * 12 = 192\n- Sheep: 12 * 13 = 156\n- Brick: 19 * 28 = 532\n- Ore: 19 * 35 = 665\n\nTotal value = 30 + 192 + 156 + 532 + 665 = 1575\n\n### Next Action\n\nWe need to decide on the next trade. Given the values, we should aim to increase our total value. \n\nNoticing the values:\n- The highest value resources are Ore (35) and Brick (28).\n- We have a good amount of Ore (19) and Brick (19).\n\nLet's think about potential trades that could be beneficial. We should consider offering resources with lower values to get higher value resources or at least maintain our current total value.\n\nSince our last offer was rejected, we need to reassess and possibly adjust our strategy.\n\n### New Trade Offer\n\nTo simplify, let's directly propose a trade that seems reasonable based on the current state.\n\nWe have a relatively low quantity of Wheat (5). Let's consider offering some Wood (which is not the highest value but is relatively abundant for us) or Sheep (since we have a decent amount) for either Brick or Ore.\n\nOne possible trade could be:\n- Offer: 4 Wood -> Requested: 1 Ore\n\nThis trade involves offering 4 Wood (Value: 4 * 12 = 48) for 1 Ore (Value: 35). While it seems like we're losing value (48 vs 35), we need to consider the negotiation aspect and what the opponent might find acceptable.\n\nLet's propose this trade.\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
