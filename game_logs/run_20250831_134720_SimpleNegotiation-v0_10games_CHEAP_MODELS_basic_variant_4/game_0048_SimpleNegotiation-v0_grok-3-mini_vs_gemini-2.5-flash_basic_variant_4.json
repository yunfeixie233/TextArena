As a competitive player, I need to focus on trades that increase my total resource value, so I'll propose a new offer that prioritizes acquiring higher-value resources while offering something of comparable or slightly lower value.\n\nMy current resources and their values:\n- Wheat: 8 qty, value 6 per unit (total value: 48)\n- Wood: 23 qty, value 8 per unit (total value: 184)\n- Sheep: 25 qty, value 18 per unit (total value: 450)\n- Brick: 20 qty, value 30 per unit (total value: 600)\n- Ore: 17 qty, value 33 per unit (total value: 561)\n\nI'll propose trading one of my Brick (value 30) for one Ore (value 33), which would net me a small gain in value (33 - 30 = +3).
