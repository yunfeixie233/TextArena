Analyze my current holdings: I have excess quantities of Wood (11), Sheep (15), Brick (15) and Ore (15); each of these resources has a lower incremental value because I already have large stocks. Wheat has a lower unit value (5) but I only have 8, so I can spare some.  \n2. Track history: every trade I have proposed (offering Wheat/Wood/Sheep, asking for Brick/Ore) has been rejected, and my opponent has not sent any offers. That suggests Player 1 is either scarce in Brick/Ore themselves or they value these resources very highly.  \n3. Decide on a new strategy: Since I have many Sheep (highest count, high unit value) and Wood, I can reduce these without hurting total value if I can secure Brick or Ore. I value Ore the most (value = 40), so acquiring Ore should have the highest priority.  \n4. Provide Player 1 with a stronger deal that appears favorable to them in order to induce acceptance: I can give 2 Wood and 6 Sheep (resources of high value per unit) in exchange for only 2 Ore. The perceived value to them should outweigh my marginal gain (I get higher total value because I avoid 17+8 = 25 value lost from Sheep and Wood and gain 2 * 40 = 80 value from Ore).  \n5.
