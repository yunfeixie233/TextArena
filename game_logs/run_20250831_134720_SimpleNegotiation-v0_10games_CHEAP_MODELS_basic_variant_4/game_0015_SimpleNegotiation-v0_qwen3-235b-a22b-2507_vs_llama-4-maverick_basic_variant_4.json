      "response": "Since Player 0 made no new trade offer, I will start by making an offer to potentially increase the total value of my resources.\n\nFirst, let's assess the current total value of my resources:\n- Wheat: 5 * 6 = 30\n- Wood: 25 * 12 = 300\n- Sheep: 11 * 13 = 143\n- Brick: 13 * 22 = 286\n- Ore: 21 * 36 = 756\n\nTotal value = 30 + 300 + 143 + 286 + 756 = 1515\n\nI need to identify resources that I have in abundance and might be considered less valuable per unit compared to others, and vice versa. I notice that I have a significant amount of Wood and Ore. Ore is quite valuable, so I'd be cautious about trading it away too much, but I can consider trading some. Wood is also valuable but less so than Ore, Brick, or Sheep.\n\nLet's consider an offer that could potentially increase my total value. One strategy is to trade away some of my less valuable resources for more valuable ones or to consolidate resources that are more valuable.\n\nI have 25 Wood, which is a considerable quantity, and its value per unit is 12. I can try to trade some Wood for another resource that has a higher value per unit. \n\nFor instance, I can offer 10 Wood (Value: 10 * 12 = 120) for a resource that is valued higher. If I can get, say, 5 Brick (Value: 5 * 22 = 110), it's not a great deal, but if I can get a more valuable resource or a bit more quantity, it might be worth it.\n\nHowever, let's directly think about a valuable trade:\n- I can offer 10 Wood and get some Ore in return, but since I already have a lot of Ore, it's not the best option.\n- Alternatively, I can think about consolidating or getting more of the higher-value resources like Ore or Brick.\n\nLet's make an offer: '[Offer: 8 Wood -> 2 Ore]' is one possibility, but I already have a lot of Ore. \n\nA potentially good trade could be: '[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Brick]' because it consolidates my resources into something more valuable or keeps the quantity of valuable resources. However, let's directly aim for something involving higher-value resources.\n\nConsidering my resources and their values, let's directly form an offer.\n\n'[Offer: 10 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 5 Brick]' \n\nThis offer gives away 10 * 12 + 1 * 13 = 120 + 13 = 133 value in resources and gets 1 * 36 + 5 * 22 = 36 + 110 = 146 value in return, making it a slightly profitable trade.\n\nLet's make this offer. \n\n'[Offer: 10 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 5 Brick]'",

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the current situation and the resources we have.\n\nResources and their values:\n- Wheat: 5 units, Value: 6\n- Wood: 25 units, Value: 12\n- Sheep: 11 units, Value: 13\n- Brick: 13 units, Value: 22\n- Ore: 21 units, Value: 36\n\nPrevious offers made by Player 1 (me) and their outcomes:\n1. Offered 8 Wood for 2 Ore: Rejected\n2. Offered 3 Wheat for 1 Ore: Rejected\n\nLet's evaluate the offers made:\n1. The first offer was 8 Wood (Value: 8*12 = 96) for 2 Ore (Value: 2*36 = 72). It was not beneficial as it resulted in a loss of value (96 - 72 = 24).\n2. The second offer was 3 Wheat (Value: 3*6 = 18) for 1 Ore (Value: 1*36 = 36). The gain here is 36 - 18 = 18, which is positive. However, it was still rejected.\n\nGiven that the last offer was rejected and there's no new offer from Player 0, we need to think about making a new offer that could be beneficial.\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- We need to identify what we can offer that is of less or comparable value to what we are requesting.\n\nConsidering our resources and the values:\n- Ore is the most valuable resource. We have 21 units of it. Requesting more Ore might not be feasible if we've already been rejected twice.\n- We can try to offer something in exchange for Ore or other valuable resources.\n\nLet's examine a new potential trade:\n- We could offer some Wood (since we have a lot, 25 units) or Sheep for Ore.\n\nFor example, offering 5 Wood (Value: 5*12 = 60) for 1 Ore (Value: 1*36 = 36) is not beneficial for us. However, we could adjust the quantity to make it more favorable.\n\nLet's think about offering something of lower value for Ore or another resource.\n\nA potential trade: \n- Offer 4 Sheep (Value: 4*13 = 52) for 2 Ore (Value: 2*36 = 72). Here, we're offering resources worth 52 for resources worth 72, gaining 20 in value.\n\nHowever, we should also consider our current quantities and the value we're willing to part with.\n\nLet's directly propose a trade:\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer gives away: 2 Sheep (2*13 = 26) and 1 Wheat (1*6 = 6), totaling 32 in value, for 1 Ore (1*36 = 36), resulting in a gain of 4.\n\nMy action: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
