Although that is a loss of 12 in raw value, Ore is still my highest-valued resource and is scarce for Player 1. More importantly, keeping Ore flow asymmetrical forces Player 1 to keep offering worse deals in the long run.\n\nTherefore I will decline and instead press my advantage by proposing something richer in Ore:\n\n[Deny]\n\nNext I want to squeeze more out of the Ore I still have. Player 1 clearly values Ore at \u2265 3 Wheat (see their previous 3 Wheat+1 Wood\u21921 Ore ask).  \n\nI\u2019ll pitch a counter-offer that slightly worsens their last ratio for me but is still reasonable:\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 5 Wheat, 1 Wood]",
