Net gain of +97.\n\n5. **Future Strategy**:\n   - Ore is the highest-value resource (40 per unit), while Wheat is the lowest (5 per unit). Focus on trading Wheat/Wood/Sheep/Brick for Ore to maximize value.\n   - Current excess resources: Wheat (8), Wood (8), Sheep (6), Brick (12).\n   - Offer trades that give up lower-value resources for Ore.\n\n6. **Next Offer**:\n   - Trade some Wheat/Wood/Sheep/Brick for Ore. A reasonable offer is to trade 4 Wheat (20 value) for 1 Ore (40 value), but Player 0 may not accept such an unbalanced trade. Adjust to 4 Wheat + 1 Wood (20 + 8 = 28 value) for 1 Ore (40 value), still uneven.\n   - Alternatively, trade 2 Sheep (36 value) for 1 Ore (40 value), net small gain for opponent. But this may be acceptable. Slightly sweeten: 2 Sheep + 1 Wheat (36 + 5 = 41) for 1 Ore + 1 Brick (40 + 23 = 63) \u2013 too much for us. Reduce to 2 Sheep for 1 Ore directly.\n\n7. **Final Offer**:\n   - [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore] is a simple, small-value gain for us (36 -> 40, +4 net), and Player 0 may accept.\n\nFinal answer: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

If I accept the trade, I lose 2 Sheep and gain 1 Ore:\n- Sheep: 13 - 2 = 11  \n- Ore: 34 + 1 = 35  \n\nTotal value will then be:\n- Total value = (3 * 6) + (7 * 8) + (11 * 12) + (10 * 21) + (35 * 39)\n\nCalculating this gives:\n- Total value = 18 + 56 + 132 + 210 + 1365 = 1781\n\n2.
