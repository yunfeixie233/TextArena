Value gained PER UNIT lost, not total.  \n   Wheat 6/24=0.25, Wood 11/5=2.2, Sheep 18/24=0.75, Brick 20/10=2.0, Ore 36/13\u22482.77  \n   -> lowest three: Wheat, Sheep, Brick (below 2.8). Ore is king, Wood is fine.\n\n2. My most numerous waste goods are Wheat (24) and Sheep (24) yet yield only 0.25 and 0.75 value; Brick (10) is middling.  \n   I therefore want to package Wheat & Sheep (the worst marginal values) to receive **Ore** and **Wood** (best two). The opponent will usually want **Brick**, **Sheep**, or **Ore**, rarely **Wheat**.\n\n3. Early rounds: Open the dialogue, gauge what opponent wants while meeting my goal: shed Sheep & Wheat, accrue Ore & Wood.\n\n4. Offer framing: Never over-shoot \u2014 one extra Ore yields ~2.8 so trading 3 Sheep (worth 2.25 value) + 2 Wheat (0.5) for 2 Ore (5.4) is a strict win (+2.65 in relative value). But visually trading multitudes of Wheat/Sheep for Ore looks generous.\n\n5. Be ready to moderate: if opponent lacks Ore, propose Wood as second pick.\n\n6.
