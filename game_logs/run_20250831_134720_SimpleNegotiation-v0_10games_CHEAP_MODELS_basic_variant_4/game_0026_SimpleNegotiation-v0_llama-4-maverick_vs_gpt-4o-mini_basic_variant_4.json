      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, I will analyze the current state of my resources and determine the best course of action to increase their total value.\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 14   Value: 6\n- [Wood]    Qty: 6    Value: 11\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 8    Value: 18\n- [Brick]   Qty: 5    Value: 21\n- [Ore]     Qty: 14   Value: 32\n\nTo maximize the total value of my resources, I need to make strategic trades. The highest value resources I have are Ore (Value: 32) and Brick (Value: 21). The lowest value resource is Wheat (Value: 6).\n\n### Trade Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value, I should aim to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones. \n\n1. **Identify Potential Trades:**\n   - I can offer Wheat (lower value) in exchange for resources of higher or comparable value.\n   - I have a good quantity of Ore, but since it's my highest value resource, I should be cautious about trading it away. However, if there's an opportunity to trade some Ore for an even more valuable combination, it might be worth considering.\n\n2. **Formulate an Initial Offer:**\n   Given the current resources, an initial offer could involve trading some Wheat (the lowest value resource) for a resource that might be of higher value or at least comparable.\n\n### Initial Offer\n\nLet's formulate an initial offer. I will offer some Wheat in exchange for Wood, as Wood has a higher value than Wheat.\n\n- I have 14 Wheat, so offering 4 Wheat could be a reasonable start.\n- I will request 2 Wood in return because it has a higher value (11) compared to Wheat (6).\n\nThe proposed trade is: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 2 Wood]`.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 2 Wood]`\n\nI'll wait for the opponent's response to this offer. If they accept, I'll gain more value. If they deny or counteroffer, I'll reassess and make a new decision based on their response or the new game state.",

For example, offering 2 Wood (2*11 = 22) for 1 Ore (1*32 = 32) could be a good trade since 32 > 22.\n\n## Step 8: Propose the trade offer in the required format.\nLet's propose: Offered items: 2 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore.\nThe offer in the required format is: [Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore].\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]}$",

Wheat (Value: 6) - We have 10 units.\n2. Wood (Value: 11) - We have 2 units.\n3. Sheep (Value: 18) - We have 8 units.\n4. Brick (Value: 21) - We have 5 units.\n5. Ore (Value: 32) - We have 13 units.\n\nSince Ore has the highest value and we have a good quantity of it, we should try to avoid giving it away. However, we can consider trading lower-value resources for higher-value ones or maintaining a good balance.\n\nLet's examine our options:\n- We can offer Wheat (low value) or Wood ( relatively low value) for something more valuable.\n\nOne potential trade could be offering Wheat for Sheep or Brick since we are low on Wood.\n\nLet's make an offer: \n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]\n\nThis trade gives away low-value Wheat for a higher-value Sheep.\n\nThe action is: [Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]",

      "response": "Let's analyze the current situation and make a decision for the next turn.\n\n### Current Resources and Values\n\nAfter the previous trades, my resources and their quantities are:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 14 - 4 - 5 - 4 = 1  \n- [Wood]    Qty: 6 - 3 + 2 - 2 = 3  \n- [Sheep]   Qty: 8  \n- [Brick]   Qty: 5  \n- [Ore]     Qty: 14 - 1 + 1 = 14  \n\nCorrected calculation based on the trades made:\n1. Initially: \n   - Wheat = 14\n   - Wood = 6\n   - Sheep = 8\n   - Brick = 5\n   - Ore = 14\n\n2. After the first trade (4 Wheat -> 2 Wood):\n   - Wheat = 14 - 4 = 10\n   - Wood = 6 + 2 = 8\n   - Sheep = 8\n   - Brick = 5\n   - Ore = 14\n\n3. After the second trade (2 Wood -> 1 Ore):\n   - Wheat = 10\n   - Wood = 8 - 2 = 6\n   - Sheep = 8\n   - Brick = 5\n   - Ore = 14 + 1 = 15\n\nSo, the correct quantities are:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 10   Value: 6\n- [Wood]    Qty: 6    Value: 11\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 8    Value: 18\n- [Brick]   Qty: 5    Value: 21\n- [Ore]     Qty: 15   Value: 32\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe total value of my current resources is:\n- 10 Wheat = 10 * 6 = 60\n- 6 Wood = 6 * 11 = 66\n- 8 Sheep = 8 * 18 = 144\n- 5 Brick = 5 * 21 = 105\n- 15 Ore = 15 * 32 = 480\nTotal Value = 60 + 66 + 144 + 105 + 480 = 855\n\nTo increase the total value, I should look for trades that give me resources with higher values or more quantity of the highest-value resources.\n\n### Decision for the Next Turn\n\nGiven the current resources and their values, Ore is the most valuable resource, and I have a considerable amount of it. The next most valuable resources are Sheep and Brick. I should try to get more of these if possible.\n\nSince Player 1 didn't make any new offers and accepted one of my offers (2 Wood -> 1 Ore), it indicates they might be interested in Wood or willing to give up Ore. My last offer was rejected (4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep), so it seems they are not willing to give up Sheep for Wheat.\n\nLet's make a new offer that could be attractive to Player 1 and beneficial to me. Considering the previous successful trade (2 Wood -> 1 Ore), I could try to offer Wood again for Ore, or look for other possibilities.\n\n### New Offer\n\nLet's propose: `[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 2 Ore]`\n\nThis offer gives away:\n- 3 Wood = 3 * 11 = 33\n- 2 Wheat = 2 * 6 = 12\nTotal given away = 33 + 12 = 45\n\nAnd requests:\n- 2 Ore = 2 * 32 = 64\n\nThe gain is 64 - 45 = 19. This is a positive gain, so it's a reasonable offer.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 2 Ore]`",
