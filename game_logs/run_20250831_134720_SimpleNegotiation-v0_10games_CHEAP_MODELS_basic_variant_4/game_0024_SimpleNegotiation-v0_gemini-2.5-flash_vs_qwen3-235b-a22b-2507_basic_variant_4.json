      "response": "The total value of my current resources is calculated as follows:\n(9 * 5) + (19 * 10) + (15 * 15) + (24 * 22) + (10 * 36)\n= 45 + 190 + 225 + 528 + 360\n= 1348\n\nMy goal is to increase this total value. I will try to make profitable trades.\n\nLet's start by offering a trade that I believe will benefit me.\nI have a lot of Brick and Wood. I also have a fair amount of Sheep. Ore is very valuable.\nI want to get more high-value items like Ore, or trade my lower-value items for higher-value ones.\n\nLooking at the values:\nWheat: 5\nWood: 10\nSheep: 15\nBrick: 22\nOre: 36\n\nI'll try to trade some Brick for Ore, or maybe Sheep for Ore if the quantity is right.\nLet's offer a trade where I give up some Brick, as I have a surplus, and try to get Ore.\nI have 24 Brick, valued at 22 each.\nI have 10 Ore, valued at 36 each.\n\nOffer: 2 Brick (44 value) for 1 Ore (36 value) would be bad for me.\nI need to offer more Brick to get Ore, or try to get something else valuable.\n\nLet's consider trading some of my cheaper resources for more valuable ones.\nI have 24 Brick. Maybe I can trade 2 Brick for 1 Sheep?\n2 Brick = 44 value. 1 Sheep = 15 value. This is bad.\n\nLet's consider trading for something I want more of, like anything that makes my total value go up.\nI'll offer to trade some of my less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\nI have 19 Wood.\nI have 9 Wheat.\n\nHow about trading a lot of cheaper resources for a few more valuable ones?\nI will try to trade some `Wood` and `Brick` for `Ore`.\n\nMy first offer:\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 5 Brick -> 3 Ore]\nValue of Offered Resources: (5 * 10) + (5 * 22) = 50 + 110 = 160\nValue of Requested Resources: (3 * 36) = 108\nThis offer makes me lose value. I made a mistake in calculation. My goal is to increase value.\n\nLet me rethink. I have to make trades that *increase* my total value.\nSo, Value(Offered Resources) < Value(Requested Resources).\nI have 24 Brick (Value 22). I have 10 Ore (Value 36).\nIf I offer 1 Brick (Value 22) for 1 Ore (Value 36), it's good for me. But unlikely to be accepted.\n\nLet's try to offload some of my high quantity resources (Wood, Brick) for something valuable.\nI want to get more Ore, or maybe more Sheep if the trade is good.\n\nLet's try this:\nI offer 3 Wood (value 30) for 1 Sheep (value 15). This is bad for me.\n\nI need to offer less value than I receive.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of resources?\nLet's say I want more Ore.\nI have 24 Brick (22 value) and 19 Wood (10 value).\n\nProposed offer:\n[Offer: 4 Brick, 2 Wood -> 3 Sheep, 1 Ore]\nValue of offered: (4 * 22) + (2 * 10) = 88 + 20 = 108\nValue of requested: (3 * 15) + (1 * 36) = 45 + 36 = 81\nThis is also not good for me. I am giving up more value than I receive.\n\nI need to swap this around. Request more valuable items, offer less valuable items.\nI have current total value of 1348.\n\nLet's try to get Ore. Ore is 36 value.\nWhat can I give for 1 Ore?\nI could give 2 Brick (44 value - bad for me).\nI could give 3 Wood (30 value - good for me). But 1 Ore for 3 Wood is probably too good for me and not accepted.\n\nLet me try to trade my lowest value items (Wheat, Wood) for something else.\nI have 9 Wheat (5 value).\nI have 19 Wood (10 value).\n\nOffer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep\nValue of offered: (3 * 5) + (2 * 10) = 15 + 20 = 35\nValue of requested: 1 * 15 = 15\nThis is bad for me. I always make this mistake.\n\nI need to make the value of what I get *higher* than the value of what I give.\n\nLet's try a very simple trade, giving Wood to get Brick.\nI have a lot of Wood (19 total, 10 value).\nI have a lot of Brick (24 total, 22 value).\n\nOffer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick\nValue of Offered: (2 * 10) = 20\nValue of Requested: (1 * 22) = 22\nThis increases my value by 2. It's a small gain, but a gain nonetheless.\nThis also reduces my Wood quantity (19 -> 17) and increases my Brick (24 -> 25).\nThis is a good start.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
