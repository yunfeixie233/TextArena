Given that Brick has a value of 26 and Ore has a value of 35, any 1-for-1 trade that gives away Wood or Sheep and gains me Brick or Ore is a net win. However, since I\u2019ve already traded a fair amount of Wheat for Brick, Player 1 might be open to a slightly larger trade now.\n\nLooking at the remaining stock, 14 Sheep at value 12 (total 168) could be a prime target to move. Trading even 3 Sheep for 1 Brick (12 \u00d7 3 = 36 \u2192 26 gain) results in a net loss. However, 4 Sheep for 1 Brick (48 vs 26) is still not great, but if I ask for 2 Bricks (26 \u00d7 2 = 52) for 5 Sheep (12 \u00d7 5 = 60), it gives Player 1 a 52:60 ratio, close to 1:1.15, which might be acceptable.  \n\nGiven that I want to be fair enough that Player 1 continues to accept, and I want to maximize the Brick haul, I\u2019ll offer 5 Sheep for 2 Bricks.\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",

Since we are only at turn 5 out of 10, continuing the high-success-rate deal (Wheat\u2192Brick) is positive EV for both of us while still inching me closer to the maximum-value collection (Ore-heavy).\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",
