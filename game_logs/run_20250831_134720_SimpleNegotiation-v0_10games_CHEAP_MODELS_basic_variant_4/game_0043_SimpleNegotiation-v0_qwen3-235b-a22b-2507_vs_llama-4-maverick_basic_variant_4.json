However, [Sheep] is more valuable than [Wheat]. Let's consider offering [Wheat] for a more valuable resource.\n\nI will make a trade offer: \n'[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Wood]'.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, trading [Wheat] (Value: 5) for [Wood] (Value: 12) could be a good start. But let's check if there's a more optimal trade.\n\nLet's directly propose a potentially beneficial trade:\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nSince [Ore] is much more valuable than [Wheat], giving away 10 [Wheat] (total value = 10 * 5 = 50) for 1 [Ore] (value = 34) doesn't seem like a good deal. However, it could be worth considering if the quantity of [Ore] I receive is more.\n\nLet's think about a trade that involves giving away a resource that is less valuable for one that is more valuable.\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick]'.\n\nHere, I'm giving away (5 * 5) + (2 * 15) = 25 + 30 = 55 value for (3 * 20) = 60 value.
