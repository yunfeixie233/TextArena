Look at the numbers.  \n   - Ore is highest-valued; Brick is second-highest.  \n   - I already hold 16 Brick and 17 Ore\u2014already strong positions.  \n   - Sheep is plentiful (21) but middle-tier value.  \n   - Wheat and Wood are abundant for me yet low-ish in value.\n\nSo I want to convert lower-valued cards (Wheat, Wood, excess Sheep) into higher-valued ones (Brick, Ore), or at least trade Sheep for the same amount of Brick or Ore without decreasing value.\n\n3.  Trade offer design.  \n   I want to offer the smallest amount of lower-value cards that still feels attractive to the other player.  \n   Since Brick and Ore are what I want, and Wood/Wheat are low, I\u2019ll use a few Sheep plus one Wheat to \u201csweeten\u201d the deal.\n\n   I need **Brick** most right now because I want to push the margin between values (24 vs 33).  \n   I\u2019m willing to give up some Sheep and a Wheat.\n\n   Example fair offer that is value-neutral or value-positive for me and still modest for the opponent:\n\n   - Offer 4 cards: 2 Sheep (14 each) + 1 Wheat (6) + 1 Wood (11) = 45 total value.  \n   - Ask 4 cards: 2 Brick (24 each) = 48 total value.  \n   The opponent gains flexibility (they get 3 types of cards), and I gain 3 points of value.\n\nLet me transmit this as my first-round proposal:\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick]\n\nThe trade is on the table; I now wait for the opponent\u2019s reaction.",
