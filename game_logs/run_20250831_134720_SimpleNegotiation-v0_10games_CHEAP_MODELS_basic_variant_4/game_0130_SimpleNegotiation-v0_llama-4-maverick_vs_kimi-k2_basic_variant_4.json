One potential trade could involve offering some Wheat or Wood for more valuable resources.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n- Trading Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 9) for other resources could be beneficial if we can get resources of higher or comparable value.\n\nA potential trade could be offering Wheat or Wood for Sheep or Brick since Ore is likely to be highly sought after and we might not get a good deal for it easily.\n\nLet's start by sending an offer to trade some Wood (less valuable than Sheep, Brick, and Ore but more than Wheat) for Sheep or Brick.\n\nSince we have a significant quantity of Wheat, let's consider offering Wheat for a more valuable resource.\n\nHere's a potential first offer:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'\n\nThis offer gives away 5 Wheat (Value: 25) for 1 Sheep (Value: 18). While it doesn't immediately seem beneficial due to the difference in value, it's a starting point. However, let's consider a more balanced trade.\n\nLet's directly aim for something more strategic:\n'[Offer: 4 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\nHere, we're offering 4 Wood (Value: 36) and 4 Wheat (Value: 20), totaling a value of 56 for 1 Brick (Value: 25). This isn't a great trade for us as it stands because we're giving away more value than we're getting.\n\nLet's rethink and directly aim for a more favorable trade.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood]' is another possibility, but we need to think about increasing our total value.\n\nSince we have a lot of Wheat and it's the least valuable, let's see if we can get rid of some Wheat for something more valuable.\n\n'[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep]' could be a good start. We're giving away (3*5) + 9 = 24 for a Sheep worth 18. Not great.\n\nLet's directly propose something that could be beneficial:\n'[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\nHere, we're giving away 6 Wheat (Value: 30) for 1 Brick (Value: 25), still not beneficial.\n\nRevisiting the idea, let's directly think about an offer that involves getting something more valuable.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep]' is another straightforward trade. We're giving away 2 Wood (Value: 18) for 1 Sheep (Value: 18), which is essentially a fair trade but doesn't increase our value.\n\nLet's directly make an offer that's a bit more reasonable:\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nHere, we're offering (10*5) + 9 = 59 for 1 Ore (Value: 37). This isn't a good trade for us.\n\nLet's think about a more balanced approach:\nWe can offer something like '[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' which is giving away 3 Sheep (Value: 54) for 1 Ore (Value: 37), clearly not beneficial.\n\nHowever, let's make an initial offer that starts the negotiation:\n'[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]' \n\nWe're giving away 8 Wheat (Value: 40) for 2 Sheep (Value: 36), still not a great trade.\n\nRethinking, a more reasonable offer considering the current values and aiming to initiate a negotiation could be:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep]'.\n\nLet's go with this: \n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep]'",

Initially, Player 0 had 12 Wheat and exchanged 5 Wheat for 1 Sheep, resulting in having 7 Wheat and 26 Sheep now.\n\nTo maximize the total value of resources, we need to assess the current distribution and think about potential trades that could increase the total value.\n\n### Potential Trades\n\n1. **Wheat for Other Resources:** With 7 Wheat, we can consider trading Wheat for other resources that might be more valuable. Given the current values, trading Wheat for Sheep, Ore, or Brick could be beneficial due to their higher values.\n\n2. **Exchanging Less Valuable Resources:** While Wheat is the least valuable resource per unit, Sheep is the next. We have a significant quantity of Sheep. We could consider trading some Sheep for resources that are more valuable per unit, like Ore or Brick.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nLet's consider making an offer to increase the total value. One potential trade could involve exchanging some of the less valuable resources for more valuable ones. \n\nFor instance, we could offer some Sheep in exchange for Ore or Brick since both are more valuable per unit than Sheep.\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nGiven the current state and the goal to increase the total value, let's propose a trade:\n\n- **[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**\n\nThis trade involves giving away 4 Sheep (total value of 4*18 = 72) in exchange for 1 Ore (value of 37). This is not a good trade as it decreases the total value.\n\nLet's reconsider and think about a more beneficial trade:\n\n- **[Offer: 2 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]**\n\nThis involves giving away 2 Wheat (2*5 = 10) and 3 Sheep (3*18 = 54), totaling 64, in exchange for 2 Brick (2*25 = 50). This trade is still not beneficial.\n\nLet's think about another option:\n\n- **[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]**\n\nWe currently have 7 Wheat. Offering 5 Wheat (5*5 = 25) for 2 Sheep (2*18 = 36) could be considered. This trade increases the total value.\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]",

      "response": "### Current Game State\n\nWe are in the Negotiation Game, and I am Player 0. The current state of my resources after the last transaction is as follows:\n\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 12 - 5 = 7   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 9 - 2 = 7    Value: 9\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 25 + 1 - 4 + 0 - 3 + 0 = 19   Value: 18\n- [Brick]   Qty: 25 - 3 = 22   Value: 25\n- [Ore]     Qty: 25 + 0 + 1 = 26   Value: 37\n\n### Analysis of the Current State\n\nAfter the last trade, my resources are:\n- 7 Wheat (Value: 5)\n- 7 Wood (Value: 9)\n- 19 Sheep (Value: 18)\n- 22 Brick (Value: 25)\n- 26 Ore (Value: 37)\n\nThe total value of my resources is: (7*5) + (7*9) + (19*18) + (22*25) + (26*37) = 35 + 63 + 342 + 550 + 962 = 1952.\n\n### Next Move\n\nTo decide the next move, let's analyze the value of the resources and the previous trades. \n\n1. **Previous Trades Outcome**: \n   - I traded 5 Wheat for 1 Sheep. The value given was 5*5 = 25, and the value received was 1*18 = 18. This was not favorable in terms of value.\n   - I attempted to trade 4 Sheep for 1 Ore, but it was rejected. The offered value was 4*18 = 72, and the requested value was 1*37 = 37. This was not a good offer.\n   - I then traded 2 Wood and 3 Brick for 1 Ore. The value given was (2*9) + (3*25) = 18 + 75 = 93, and the value received was 1*37 = 37. This was also not favorable.\n\n2. **Resource Value Analysis**:\n   - The highest value resource is Ore, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Given that Ore is the most valuable resource, my goal should be to accumulate more Ore if possible without giving away too much value.\n   - Since my last trade for Ore was not very favorable, I need to consider a better offer.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n\nLet's propose a trade that gives away less value for 1 Ore. One possible trade could be offering resources that are not as valuable to me but are more valuable to the opponent.\n\nConsidering the values:\n- Offering 2 Sheep (2*18 = 36) for 1 Ore (1*37 = 37) might be a slightly better deal than before but still not very favorable.\n- Another option could be to offer some Wheat and Wood for Ore, but given their low value, it might not be attractive to the opponent.\n\nLet's make a trade offer that is potentially more balanced:\n- Offered items: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n\nThe value given is (1*25) + (1*18) = 43, and the value requested is 1*37 = 37. This is still not a very good trade for me, but it's a compromise.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis is my next move. I will wait for the opponent's response.",
