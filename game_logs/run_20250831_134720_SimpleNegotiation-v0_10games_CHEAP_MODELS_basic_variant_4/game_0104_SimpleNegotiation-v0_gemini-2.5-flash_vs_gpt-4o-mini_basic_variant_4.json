I also have a lot of Sheep and Wheat. I want to get rid of Wheat and Wood and get more valuable resources such as Ore or Brick.\n\nI will try to trade some of my less valuable resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) for more valuable ones (Ore, Brick).\n\nLet's propose an offer that benefits me.\nI will offer a mix of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep, and ask for Ore or Brick.\n\nTry to target a scenario where I gain more value than I give up.\nI have a lot of Ore. Player 1 accepted my previous offer where I traded Away Brick and Sheep for Ore. This suggests Player 1 might be interested in Sheep.\n\nLet's try to offer a substantial amount of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep for a smaller amount of Ore or Brick.\n\nConsider: [Offer: 10 Wheat, 4 Wood, 5 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\n\tOffered Value: (10 Wheat * 6) + (4 Wood * 11) + (5 Sheep * 16) = 60 + 44 + 80 = 184\n\tRequested Value: (3 Ore * 32) = 96\nThis is too much in my favor, unlikely to be accepted.\n\nLet's try to make it more balanced, but still beneficial to me.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of low-value resources for a decent amount of high-value resources?\nI have a surplus of Wheat and Ore.\n\nMaybe I can offer Wheat and Sheep for Brick or Ore.\n\nHow about trying to convert some Wheat and Sheep into Brick?\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 8 Sheep -> 5 Brick]\n\tOffered Value: (10 Wheat * 6) + (8 Sheep * 16) = 60 + 128 = 188\n\tRequested Value: (5 Brick * 23) = 115\nStill not good for the opponent.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nWhat if I offer Sheep and Brick for Ore? I have a lot of Brick.\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 5 Brick -> 4 Ore]\n\tOffered Value: (5 Sheep * 16) + (5 Brick * 23) = 80 + 115 = 195\n\tRequested Value: (4 Ore * 32) = 128\nAlso not good for the opponent.\n\nI need to make an offer that is attractive to Player 1, based on their offering me Wheat and Wood, and me trading them Brick and Sheep previously. Player 1 seems to want Wheat and Wood.\n\nMy goal is to increase my total value. So I still want to give away lower-value items for higher-value items.\nLet's make an offer where I give away some Wheat and Wood, and perhaps something else, for Ore or Brick.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wheat and Wood for some high-value items, slightly unbalanced in my favor?\n[Offer: 12 Wheat, 6 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]\n\tOffered Value: (12 Wheat * 6) + (6 Wood * 11) = 72 + 66 = 138\n\tRequested Value: (2 Ore * 32) + (1 Brick * 23) = 64 + 23 = 87\nThis is also a bad trade for the opponent.\n\nMaybe I should offer something Player 1 might want for something I want. Player 1 offered Wheat and Wood. This might mean they have a surplus of these or want to get rid of them. My inventory has a lot of Wheat, Sheep, Brick, Ore. My Wood quantity is the lowest.\n\nLet's try to trade some of my excess Wheat and Sheep for Ore.\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 6 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\n\tOffered Value: (8 Wheat * 6) + (6 Sheep * 16) = 48 + 96 = 144\n\tRequested Value: (3 Ore * 32) = 96\nStill not good for the opponent.\n\nI should try to get more Ore or Brick while minimizing the value I give up.\nI have a lot of Ore (24) and Brick (20). Don't need to acquire more yet unless it's a very good deal.\nI have a lot of Wheat (22) and Sheep (20). These are good to trade away.\n\nLet's try to create a balanced offer.\nI want to increase my total value.\n\nCould I offer a small amount of Ore or Brick along with my lower value items for even more valuable items? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI will try to trade Wheat and Wood for Ore.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Ore]\n\tOffered Value: (10 Wheat * 6) + (5 Wood * 11) = 60 + 55 = 115\n\tRequested Value: (3 Ore * 32) = 96\nStill not good enough for Player 1.\n\nLet's try to offer a more generous amount of Wheat and Sheep for a smaller amount of Ore or Brick.\n[Offer: 12 Wheat, 10 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\n\tOffered Value: (12 Wheat * 6) + (10 Sheep * 16) = 72 + 160 = 232\n\tRequested Value: (3 Ore * 32) = 96\nThis is a terrible offer for me.\n\nI need to make an offer where the value I give up is less than the value I receive.\nLet's consider that Player 1 might be short on Brick or Ore, as they offered Wheat and Wood (lower value).\n\nWhat about trading a lot of Wheat for some Ore?\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 3 Ore]\n\tOffered Value: 15 * 6 = 90\n\tRequested Value: 3 * 32 = 96\nThis means I give up 90 value to get 96 value. This is a gain of 6 value. This is acceptable for me and might be acceptable for the opponent if they need Wheat or have a surplus of Ore.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable offer for me.
