      "response": "After reviewing the trade history and current resource values, I see an opportunity to leverage our successful Sheep-for-Ore trade pattern at a rate that may appeal to Player 1. I currently have excess Sheep (low value per unit \u22480.739) and desire more Ore (high value per unit \u22482.909). The previous trade of 11 Sheep for 6 Ore was accepted, but my subsequent offer of 12 Sheep for 7 Ore was rejected. To propose a compelling trade that maintains value growth while respecting Player 1\u2019s hesitation:  \n\n- I\u2019ll offer **9 Sheep** (giving up \u22486.65 in value) for **5 Ore** (gaining \u224814.55 in value), netting me an estimated +7.9 value.  \n- This rate (5 Ore per 9 Sheep) is closer to our successful trade (6 Ore per 11 Sheep) and is better for Player 1 than my last offer (7 Ore per 12 Sheep).  \n\nGiven Player 1\u2019s previous acceptance of Sheep-for-Ore trades and limited counteroffers, I believe this balanced offer has a reasonable chance of acceptance.  \n\n**Action:**  \n[Offer: 9 Sheep -> 5 Ore]",
