Let's examine our resources and think about potential trades.\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 17 (Value: 6)\n   - Wood: 16 (Value: 12)\n   - Sheep: 23 (Value: 16)\n   - Brick: 5 (Value: 27)\n   - Ore: 10 (Value: 40)\n\n2. **Potential Trades:**\n   - We can try to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but in greater quantity if it makes sense strategically.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate a Trade Offer\n\nLet's consider making a trade that could potentially increase our total value. \n\nOne potential trade could involve offering resources that are less valuable to us for resources that are more valuable.\n\nFor example, we could think about trading some Wheat (Value: 6) or Wood (Value: 12) for higher-value resources like Ore (Value: 40) or Brick (Value: 27).\n\n### Step 5: Propose a Trade\n\nLet's propose a trade:\n- Offer: 4 Wheat (4*6 = 24), 1 Wood (1*12 = 12) -> Request: 2 Brick (2*27 = 54)\n\nTotal value offered = 24 + 12 = 36\nTotal value requested = 54\n\nThis trade increases our total value by 18 (54 - 36).\n\nThe proposed trade in the required format is:\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick]`\n\n### The Next Action\n\nSince we've decided on a potential trade, let's issue this offer to Player 1.\n\nThe final response is: `[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick]`",
