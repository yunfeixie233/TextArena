Given the current values, Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\n#### First Turn:\nLet's analyze the resources and consider a trade that could be beneficial. We have a good quantity of Ore, which is highly valued, and Brick, which is also valuable. We can consider trading some Wheat or Wood, which are less valuable, for more Sheep if possible, or maintaining our current high-value resources if an advantageous trade is available.\n\nSince we are Player 0, we start by making an offer.

To maximize the total value, I should look for trades that increase it. Given the current resources and values, I should consider trading resources with lower values for those with higher values.\n\n### Potential Trades\n\n1. **Trading Wheat for higher-value resources**: Since Wheat has a low value (6), I can consider trading it for resources with higher values.\n2. **Trading Wood for higher-value resources**: Wood has a value of 11, which is relatively low compared to other resources like Sheep (15), Brick (24), and Ore (38).\n\n### Trade Offer for Turn 2\n\nLet's consider offering 3 Wood (Value: 3 * 11 = 33) for 2 Sheep (Value: 2 * 15 = 30). Although this specific trade slightly decreases the total value, it's a starting point. However, we need a trade that increases or at least doesn't significantly decrease the total value.\n\nA potential trade could be: '[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]'  \n- Offering 2 Wood (Value: 22) for 1 Brick (Value: 24) would increase the total value.\n\n### Action for Turn 2\n\nI will make the following trade offer to Player 1: '[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]'\n\n### Response Format\n\nSince there's no incoming offer from Player 1 to accept or deny, my action is to make a new offer.\n\nThe action for Turn 2 is: `[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]`",

Correct count: I had 20, gave 0, received 5 = 25, then I gave 0 and received 0 in the last 2 steps related to brick.

Thus, I should deny this offer.\n\n### Making a New Offer\n\nLet's think about a new offer. I have:\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 15, Value: 6\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 7, Value: 11\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 17, Value: 15\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 25, Value: 24\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 23, Value: 38\n\nTo increase my total value, I should try to get resources with higher values or more quantity of resources that are relatively valuable.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering **[Wheat]** or **[Wood]** (lower value resources) for something more valuable.\n\n### Offer\n\nLet's make an offer: **[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]**\n\nThe value of 3 Wheat is 3 * 6 = 18, and the value of 1 Brick is 24. This seems like a reasonable trade as I'm getting a resource worth 24 for resources worth 18.\n\nSo, the action is: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\n### Response\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`",

Player 1 offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, rejected by Player 0.\n5. Player 0 offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, rejected by Player 1.\n6. Player 1 offered 3 Sheep for 1 Ore.\n\n#### Observations:\n- Player 1 is willing to trade Sheep for Ore, and we've already accepted one such offer.\n- We rejected the second offer of 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, and Player 1 rejected our counteroffer of 2 Sheep for 1 Ore.\n- The last offer from Player 1 is similar to the first one they made and we accepted.\n\n### Decision for Turn 8\n\nGiven the pattern of trades and the current resource values, we need to decide whether to accept or reject the current offer and whether to make a new offer.\n\n1. **Evaluate the Current Offer:**\n   - Offered: 3 Sheep (Value: 3 * 15 = 45)\n   - Requested: 1 Ore (Value: 1 * 38 = 38)\n   - Since 45 > 38, this trade is not favorable for us.\n\n2. **Decision on Current Offer:**\n   - We should reject this offer because it's not beneficial.\n\n3. **New Offer:**\n   - Let's consider making a new offer that could be beneficial.\n   - We have a surplus of Brick and Ore relative to other resources. Let's see if we can trade some of these for something more valuable.\n   - One potential trade could involve offering some Brick or Ore for Sheep or Wood, as these are relatively less abundant for us.\n\n4. **Proposed New Offer:**\n   - Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Sheep\n   - This is a potentially favorable trade because 1 Ore (Value: 38) for 4 Sheep (Value: 4 * 15 = 60) is beneficial for us.\n\n### Action for Turn 8\n\n[Deny] the current offer from Player 1 because it is not favorable.\nMake a new offer: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Sheep]\n\n### Output:\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Sheep]",
