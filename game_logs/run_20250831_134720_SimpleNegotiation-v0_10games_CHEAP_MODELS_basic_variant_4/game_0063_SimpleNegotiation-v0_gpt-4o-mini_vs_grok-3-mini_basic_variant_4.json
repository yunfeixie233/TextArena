Accepting will decrease your Sheep count significantly, but it will increase your Wood, which may be beneficial for future trades.\n\nSince trading your Sheep now for Wood doesn't seem to improve your overall resource value based on current counts (specifically since you are low on Sheep), I will **deny** this trade offer.\n\nMy response is:\n[Deny]",
