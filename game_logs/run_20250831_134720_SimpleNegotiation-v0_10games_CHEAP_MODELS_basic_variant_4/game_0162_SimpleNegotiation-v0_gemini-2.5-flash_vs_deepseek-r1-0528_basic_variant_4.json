Requesting 5 Ore (total value **190**) yields a net gain of **40** for me.  \n- **Resource strategy**: Wheat (value 6/unit) and Wood (value 9/unit) are my lowest-value resources with surplus quantities. Trading them for Ore (value 38/unit) optimizes value growth.  \n- **Risk mitigation**: This trade preserves my moderate/high-value Sheep (maintaining 19) and Brick (maintaining 2), while substantially increasing Ore holdings.  \n\nPlayer 0 has demonstrated willingness to trade Ore (as seen in the previous accepted offer of 5 Ore for 3 Brick), increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
