This means a net loss of 60 for Player 0. This is not a beneficial trade for Player 0.\n\nPlayer 0 must try to make a beneficial trade. The goal is to increase the total value of Player 0's resources.\nPlayer 0 has a good amount of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep, which are lower value resources. Brick and Ore are higher value. Player 0 has a good quantity of all resources.\n\nPlayer 1 seems interested in Wheat, Wood, and Sheep, and willing to part with Ore and Brick. This is a good direction.\nThe previous offer was [Offer: 20 Wheat, 2 Wood, 5 Sheep -> 4 Ore, 1 Brick]. Player 1 didn't accept that.\nPlayer 1 counter-offered with [Offer: 4 Ore, 1 Brick -> 20 Wheat, 3 Wood, 5 Sheep].\nPlayer 1 increased their request for wood from 2 to 3.\n\nLet's try to slightly adjust Player 0's offer to be more appealing to Player 1, without losing net value.\nPlayer 0 originally offered 20 Wheat (120), 2 Wood (18), 5 Sheep (70) = 208 for 4 Ore (128), 1 Brick (29) = 157.\nThis was a -51 trade for Player 0, which means Player 0 was asking for too much from Player 1. My previous calculations were wrong. I still have to be careful with my trade values.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the previous offer:\n[Offer: 20 Wheat, 2 Wood, 5 Sheep -> 4 Ore, 1 Brick]\nValue Offered by Player 0: 20*6 + 2*9 + 5*14 = 120 + 18 + 70 = 208\nValue Requested by Player 0: 4*32 + 1*29 = 128 + 29 = 157\nThis offer was asking Player 1 to make a -51 trade. No wonder Player 1 rejected. My strategy was to get more value than I give. This is what both players want. I need to make the offer more balanced for Player 1, but still beneficial for me.\n\nPlayer 1's last offer was [Offer: 4 Ore, 1 Brick -> 20 Wheat, 3 Wood, 5 Sheep].\nPlayer 1 offers 157 value, requests 217 value. Again, a bad offer for Player 0 (-60 value).\n\nLet's rethink Player 0's goal. Get high value items for low value items.\nPlayer 0 wants to give away Wheat, Wood, Sheep for Ore and Brick.\nOre: 32 per unit\nBrick: 29 per unit\nSheep: 14 per unit\nWood: 9 per unit\nWheat: 6 per unit\n\nLet's try to make an offer that is slightly better than even for Player 0, and not too bad for Player 1.\nConsider Player 0 giving 20 Wheat (120 value).\nWhat can Player 0 get for that?\nHow about 3 Ore (96 value) + 1 Sheep (14 value) = 110 value. Not good enough.\nHow about 3 Ore (96 value) + 1 Brick (29 value) = 125 value. This is a net gain of 5 for P0. P1 would lose 5.\n[Offer: 20 Wheat -> 3 Ore, 1 Brick] - This is a simple one.\n\nLet's try to trade more.\nWhat if Player 0 offers a bundle of lower value items?\n20 Wheat (120) + 10 Wood (90) = 210 value.\nWhat can Player 0 get for that?\nMaybe 6 Ore (192) + 1 Brick (29) = 221 value. This is good for P0 (+11). P1 loses 11.\n[Offer: 20 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 6 Ore, 1 Brick]\n\nLet's try to give less and request more.\nPlayer 0 has been consistently rejected, so Player 0 might be asking for too much or giving too little.\nLet's make an offer that is attractive to Player 1, but still beneficial for Player 0.\n\nPlayer 1 offered [Offer: 4 Ore, 1 Brick -> 20 Wheat, 3 Wood, 5 Sheep] (Value P1 offers 157, Value P1 requests 217).\nPlayer 1 wants the Wheat, Wood, and Sheep.\n\nLet's try to offer 20 Wheat, 5 Wood, 5 Sheep for 5 Ore.\n20 Wheat (120) + 5 Wood (45) + 5 Sheep (70) = 235\n5 Ore = 5 * 32 = 160\nThis is still bad for Player 1. Player 1 loses 75.\n\nLet's try to go for a moderately beneficial trade for Player 0.\nPlayer 0 offers 20 Wheat (120).\nPlayer 0 requests 3 Brick (87). P0 loses 33. No.\nPlayer 0 requests 4 Brick (116). P0 loses 4. No.\nPlayer 0 requests 5 Brick (145). P0 gains 25. P1 loses 25. This might be too much.\n\nLet's consider an exchange ratio.\n1 Ore = 32. 1 Brick = 29.\n1 Wheat = 6. 1 Wood = 9. 1 Sheep = 14.\n\nApproximate ratio: 1 Ore ~ 5-6 Wheat. 1 Brick ~ 5 Wheat.\n1 Ore ~ 3-4 Wood. 1 Brick ~ 3 Wood.\n1 Ore ~ 2 Sheep. 1 Brick ~ 2 Sheep.\n\nLet's try this: 1 Ore for 2 Sheep and 1 Wood.\nOre: 32. Sheep: 14*2=28, Wood: 9*1=9. Total 37.\nThis is favorable for P0 (P0 gives 37, gets 32). P1 would get 37, give 32 (P1 gains 5). This can be acceptable!\nSo, if P0 gives 2 Sheep, 1 Wood, and gets 1 Ore. Net gain for P0 = -32+37 = 5.\nThis can be repeated.\nLet's offer 10 Sheep (140) and 5 Wood (45) for 5 Ore (160).\nPlayer 0 offers: 10 Sheep (140) + 5 Wood (45) = 185\nPlayer 0 requests: 5 Ore (160)\nThis would be: Player 0 gives 185, gets 160. Player 0 loses 25. This is not beneficial. My calculation of \"favorable\" was wrong. Player 0 wants to give less value and get more value.\n\nI should make sure that (Value of requested items) > (Value of offered items).\n\nLet's try for a small gain for Player 0, so it might be accepted.\nOffer: 20 Wheat (120)\nRequest: 3 Ore (96) + 1 Brick (29) = 125\nP0 offers 120, P0 requests 125. P0 gain = 5. P1 loses 5. This is fair.\n\nLet's try a different combination still involving lower value items.\nOffer: 10 Wheat (60) + 10 Wood (90) = 150\nRequest: 4 Ore (128) + 1 Brick (29) = 157\nP0 offers 150, P0 requests 157. P0 gain = 7. P1 loses 7. This also looks like a good candidate.\nPlayer 0 has plenty of Wheat and Wood. This trade would reduce those quantities and increase Ore and Brick.\n\nLet's propose: [Offer: 10 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 4 Ore, 1 Brick]\nThis offers a gain of 7 to Player 0, which is small enough that Player 1 might accept, especially since Player 1 has been trying to get Wheat and Wood.\n\nConsider Player 0's inventory afterward:\nWheat: 20 - 10 = 10\nWood: 25 - 10 = 15\nSheep: 22 (no change)\nBrick: 11 + 1 = 12\nOre: 12 + 4 = 16\n\nThis looks like a good move.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"Offer: 10 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 4 Ore, 1 Brick\"\n}\n```",
