Ore is the most valuable resource, followed by Brick, then Wood, Sheep, and finally Wheat.\n\nA good starting strategy is to hold onto Ore and Brick since they are the most valuable, and consider trading away less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nLet's make an initial offer to see if we can get a better deal. I can offer some Wheat (the least valuable resource) and possibly some Wood (the next least valuable) for something more valuable.\n\n### Turn 1:\nI will start by offering 5 Wheat for 1 Brick, as Brick is more valuable than Wheat.\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis is a reasonable starting point because I'm giving away 5 Wheat (Value: 5*5 = 25) for 1 Brick (Value: 21), which initially seems unfavorable. However, it's a starting negotiation, and I can adjust based on the response.\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response. \n\nSince I have to follow the format to the letter and provide a single action per turn, I will proceed with the action.\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`",

Player 1 rejected it.\n   - Player 0 offered 4 Wood for 2 Ore. Player 1 rejected it.\n   - Player 1 offered 8 Wheat for 2 Ore.\n\nLet's examine the last offer made by Player 1: **8 Wheat -> 2 Ore**.\n\nTo decide on a response:\n- If we accept, we give up 2 Ore (Value: 34 * 2 = 68) and get 8 Wheat (Value: 5 * 8 = 40).\n- The net change in value if we accept = 40 (gain) - 68 (loss) = -28.\n\nSince accepting this offer results in a negative net value change, it's not beneficial.\n\nLet's analyze our resources again and consider making a new offer. We need to identify resources we can offer that are of relatively lower value to us and resources we request that are of higher value.\n\nOur resources and their total values are:\n- Wheat: 9 * 5 = 45\n- Wood: 17 * 11 = 187\n- Sheep: 8 * 12 = 96\n- Brick: 10 * 21 = 210\n- Ore: 11 * 34 = 374\n\nTotal value = 45 + 187 + 96 + 210 + 374 = 912\n\nTo increase our total value, we should look for opportunities to gain resources with higher values or reduce the loss of higher-value resources.\n\nConsidering our previous offers were rejected, and the values:\n- We could offer some Wheat (lower value) or possibly Wood (moderate value) for a resource with a higher value than what we're offering.\n\nLet's think about a new offer:\n- We could offer some Wheat and/or Wood for Ore or Brick since they have higher values.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering Wheat and/or Wood for Brick or Ore. Let's formulate an offer:\n- We could offer 6 Wheat (Value: 30) and 2 Wood (Value: 22) for 1 Ore (Value: 34). Total offered value = 52, requested value = 34. This is not favorable as it results in a net loss.\n\nHowever, a different combination could work:\n- Offer 5 Wood (Value: 55) for 2 Brick (Value: 42) is not favorable.\n- But, offering resources for Ore could be tricky given its high value.\n\nLet's directly formulate a reasonable offer:\n- **Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore**\n\nThis translates to: **[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**.\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n- We offer 4 Wheat (4*5 = 20) and 1 Sheep (1*12 = 12), totaling 32 in value.\n- We request 1 Ore (1*34 = 34).\n\nThe net gain = 34 (gain) - 32 (loss) = 2.\n\nThis is a slightly positive trade.\n\nMy response will be:\n**[Deny]** to Player 1's offer because it's not beneficial.\n**[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]** as our new offer.\n\nSo, my action is: `[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`.",

Total value offered = 60 + 21 = 81\n- Requested: 2 Ore = 2 * 34 = 68\n\nThe total value of the offered items (81) is greater than the total value of the requested items (68), so accepting this offer would increase my total resource value.\n\nSince the offer is beneficial, I will accept it.\n\n[Accept]",
