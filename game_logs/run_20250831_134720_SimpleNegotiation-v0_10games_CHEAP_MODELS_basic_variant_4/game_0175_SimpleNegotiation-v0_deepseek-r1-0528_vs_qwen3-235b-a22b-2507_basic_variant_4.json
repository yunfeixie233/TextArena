The extra Wood adds versatility, making the loss more palatable.  \n    - Past offers (e.g., my 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore) were rejected for being too favor skewed (+13 for me, -13 for them). This tones it down while keeping momentum.  \n\n### Strategic Adjustments:  \n- **Why not other resources?**  \n  - Brick trades (e.g., 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick) net me +9 value but cost them 9\u2014similar imbalance.  \n  - Including **Wood** here diversifies the offer, potentially appealing if they\u2019re low on it.  \n- **Risk**: If rejected, I\u2019ll pivot to Brick next turn to test their priorities. But given Ore\u2019s high value (32 vs. Sheep\u2019s 17), this is still the optimal play.  \n\nYou in? This could jumpstart the market between us.  \n\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
