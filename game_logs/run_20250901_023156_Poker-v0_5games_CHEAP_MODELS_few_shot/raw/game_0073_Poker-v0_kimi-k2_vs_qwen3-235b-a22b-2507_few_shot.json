This is a strong, offsuit Broadway hand that does very well against typical SB stealing ranges (often ~50 % of hands). It flops top-pair and big draws frequently, and has good equity even when dominated. Pots should be bloated now, not later.\n\nPot is 30, facing 10 to call. A simple flat-call is okay but risks going multi-way into the flop passively. Instead I\u2019ll make a 3-bet to roughly 3\u00d7 the open (60 total) to take the initiative and deny equity to weaker hands, while building value when ahead.\n\n[Raise 40]",

Action: '[Raise 50]' because pocket aces are the strongest starting hand and should be played aggressively to build the pot.\n\nExample 2: You have 7\u2663 2\u2666 (worst starting hand) and opponent bets big. Action: '[Fold]' because this hand has almost no chance of winning and continuing would waste chips.\n\nExample 3: You have a strong flush draw on the flop, opponent checks, pot is 100 chips. Action: '[Bet 40]' to take control and potentially win immediately, or build pot for when you complete your draw.\n\nExample 4: You're short on chips (only 200 left) and have A\u2660 K\u2666 facing a big raise. Action: '[Call]' or '[Raise 200]' all-in because AK is strong enough to risk your tournament life with a short stack.\n\nAvailable actions (exact tokens):\n  '[Check]'  - when no bet is live\n  '[Call]'   - match the current bet\n  '[Fold]'   - discard your hand\n  '[Bet N]'  - open for N chips\n  '[Raise N]'- raise by N chips\n\nInvalid actions will result in retries. Use exact bracket format and ensure you have sufficient chips for bets/raises. Check when facing a bet is invalid.\n[GAME] Starting a new 10-round Texas Hold'em game with 2 players.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 990.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2663, K\u2660\n==============================================\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 60.\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 80 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2663, 10\u2665\n==============================================\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 990.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 7\u2660, 3\u2665\n==============================================\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2660, 3\u2665\n==============================================\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 990.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 7\u2660, A\u2660\n==============================================\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 30.\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2665, 10\u2665, 2\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 7\u2660, A\u2660\n==============================================\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 100 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1050.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 920.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2663, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[GAME] Invalid action attempt 1/3: Invalid poker action.
