In heads-up play K9o is a marginal holding\u2014vulnerable to an ace, dominated by stronger K-x or T-dominated hands\u2014but it's not hopeless when getting pot odds of 3-to-1 (need to call 10 to win 30).\n\nGiven our above-average stack (990 vs. pot of 30), the implied odds aren't enormous, yet this hand plays decently post-flop if we hit the flop. Folding would be overly tight. The SB opened to the minimum, indicating moderate strength at best, but still a much stronger range than K9o; thus a 3-bet for value is unjustified.\n\nA simple call keeps the pot smaller, sees the flop in position, and keeps future streets easier to navigate.\n\n[Call]",
