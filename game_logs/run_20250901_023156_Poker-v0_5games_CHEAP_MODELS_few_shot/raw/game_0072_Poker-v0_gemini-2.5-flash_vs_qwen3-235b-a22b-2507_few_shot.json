Action: '[Raise 50]' because pocket aces are the strongest starting hand and should be played aggressively to build the pot.\n\nExample 2: You have 7\u2663 2\u2666 (worst starting hand) and opponent bets big. Action: '[Fold]' because this hand has almost no chance of winning and continuing would waste chips.\n\nExample 3: You have a strong flush draw on the flop, opponent checks, pot is 100 chips. Action: '[Bet 40]' to take control and potentially win immediately, or build pot for when you complete your draw.\n\nExample 4: You're short on chips (only 200 left) and have A\u2660 K\u2666 facing a big raise. Action: '[Call]' or '[Raise 200]' all-in because AK is strong enough to risk your tournament life with a short stack.\n\nAvailable actions (exact tokens):\n  '[Check]'  - when no bet is live\n  '[Call]'   - match the current bet\n  '[Fold]'   - discard your hand\n  '[Bet N]'  - open for N chips\n  '[Raise N]'- raise by N chips\n\nInvalid actions will result in retries. Use exact bracket format and ensure you have sufficient chips for bets/raises. Check when facing a bet is invalid.\n[GAME] Starting a new 10-round Texas Hold'em game with 2 players.\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 -
