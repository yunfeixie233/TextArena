The board shows 3\u2665, 6\u2660, A\u2660, 9\u2660.\n\n2. **Analysis**: \n   - You started with 2\u2666 and 5\u2666, which isn't a strong starting hand.\n   - The flop came with A\u2660, 3\u2665, and 6\u2660. You didn't improve your hand.\n   - On the turn, the board became A\u2660, 3\u2665, 6\u2660, 9\u2660. The appearance of 9\u2660 indicates a possible flush draw for your opponent or a strong spade holding. You still haven't improved your hand.\n\n3. **Opponent's Action**: \n   - Your opponent bet 40 into a pot of 80 after checking on the flop. This indicates they might be trying to build the pot with a hand they think is strong or potentially taking a stab at the pot.\n\n4. **Your Action**:\n   - Given that you have not improved your hand and the board suggests potential strong holdings (like a flush or high pairs), your hand is not strong.\n   - The bet by your opponent suggests they have something or are putting pressure.\n\n5. **Decision**: \n   - Considering the above, your best action would be to **[Fold]**. You don't have a strong hand, and continuing to play could risk more chips against potentially stronger holdings.\n\nThus, my action is: **[Fold]**",

Action: '[Raise 50]' because pocket aces are the strongest starting hand and should be played aggressively to build the pot.\n\nExample 2: You have 7\u2663 2\u2666 (worst starting hand) and opponent bets big. Action: '[Fold]' because this hand has almost no chance of winning and continuing would waste chips.\n\nExample 3: You have a strong flush draw on the flop, opponent checks, pot is 100 chips. Action: '[Bet 40]' to take control and potentially win immediately, or build pot for when you complete your draw.\n\nExample 4: You're short on chips (only 200 left) and have A\u2660 K\u2666 facing a big raise. Action: '[Call]' or '[Raise 200]' all-in because AK is strong enough to risk your tournament life with a short stack.\n\nAvailable actions (exact tokens):\n  '[Check]'  - when no bet is live\n  '[Call]'   - match the current bet\n  '[Fold]'   - discard your hand\n  '[Bet N]'  - open for N chips\n  '[Raise N]'- raise by N chips\n\nInvalid actions will result in retries. Use exact bracket format and ensure you have sufficient chips for bets/raises.
