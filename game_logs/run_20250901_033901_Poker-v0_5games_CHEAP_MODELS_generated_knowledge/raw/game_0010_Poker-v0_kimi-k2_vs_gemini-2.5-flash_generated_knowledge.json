      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. Hand Strength: K8s is a borderline hand. Heads-up, being dealt any King-high is above average (you still beat ~50 % of all \u201crandom\u201d one-hand ranges), and the suited quality adds ~2 % pre-flop equity. It\u2019s strong enough to defend the big-blind very wide, but still behind a normal \u201copening range\u201d like any pair, most aces, better Kings, Q9+ etc.\n2. Pot Odds & Stack Depth: The small-blind has put the 3-bet in (20), creating pot odds of 30 : 10 = 3:1. We only need 25 % equity to continue (pure MDF math). K8s has ~41 % raw equity vs an average SB 3-bet range, giving us a clear call purely on equity.  \n3. Position & Initiative: Post-flop we\u2019ll be out of position. We do not have the betting lead, so unless we improve we\u2019ll often have to play fit-or-fold small-ball post-flop. However, the SPR (stack-to-pot ratio) after a call will be (980-10)/50 \u2248 19.4, which is plenty deep; we can realise more equity than in shallow stacks.\n4. Range Morphology: SB risks only 20 to win 30; theory says they should 3-bet wide heads-up (any pair, any ace, any two broadway, most suited connectors). Therefore we should also defend wide \u2013 anything inside the top ~65 % of hands qualifies K8s easily.\n5. ICM/Survival: No immediate ICM concerns in 10-hand freeze-out\u2014after this hand we\u2019ll be likely navigating with ~1/3\u20131/4 of the 10 hands yet to play, so small edges compound rather than become ultra-risk-averse. Variance early is acceptable.\n\nDecision: The 10-chip call returns 3:1 with medium-strength equity. Folding is far too tight heads-up. Raising is possible, but out of position with K8s we are bloating the pot without a big equity edge. A simple call lets us realise equity, see the flop cheaply, and preserve the deeper-stack play we possess.\n\n[Call]",

I do not have a pair, a straight draw, or a flush draw. The J\u2665 is an \"under-card\" to the Q\u2663. My equity is very low.\n\nAgainst a single opponent, especially in a small blind vs big blind situation, there are times to bluff, but with a completely missed flop and an opponent who has already shown some strength pre-flop (by calling the small blind's limp or raise, or simply being the big blind), it's generally not advisable to bluff with air.\n\nMy immediate options are check or bet. Betting would be a bluff. Checking passes the action to the opponent. Given the weakness of my hand, protecting my stack by folding to future aggression or checking to see a free turn card if the opponent checks behind is the most prudent strategy. I have limited information about my opponent's hand, but it's likely they have something given the board.\n\nBetting here with a super weak hand (air) would be a pure bluff. The chances of getting a fold are low because if the opponent has any piece of the board (a pair of queens, tens, eights, or even a strong draw like a king-jack or ace-king for a straight draw, or two clubs for a flush draw), they will likely call. Our hand has very little equity to improve.\n\nChecking is the default play out of position with a weak hand. It allows me to see what my opponent does. If they bet, I can re-evaluate. If they check, I get a free card.\n\nDecision: Check.\n\n[Check]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\u2022 Strength on this flop: Middle pair (8) with a gut-shot-wheel draw (J9 would complete a king-high straight). Currently we have showdown value but are rarely ahead of a betting range that includes over-pairs, queens, or tens.  \n\u2022 Two-tone flop (Q\u2663-8\u2663-T\u2666) contains a flush draw; every \u2663-suited hand in either range now has at least 9 outs, so we must consider future aggression.  \n\u2022 Position: As the big blind / on the button, we act last; this allows pot control or bluff catching and makes checking behind weaker showdown hands favorable.  \n\u2022 SPR (Stack-to-Pot Ratio) \u2248 980 / 40 \u2248 24 (\u201cdeep stack\u201d territory). Mistakes here cost big chunks of our tournament life\u2014but also provide maneuvering space.  \n\u2022 Bet-size theory: When deciding whether to bet for protection/ thin value we risk forcing out worse hands (bluffs, Ace-high) while building a pot we rarely improve on turn/river. Without significant fold equity, betting small or checking to realize equity is better.  \n\u2022 Mental game: Early in a 10-hand mini-match we want to build a tight-aggressive image first; over-folding flop when we have middle pair + outs keeps our calling credible later.  \n\u2022 Line consideration: Check \u2192 we keep in all bluffs and can reevaluate turn; Probe-bet \u2192 folds out ace-high and pocket 2-7 (thin profit) but faces check-raise semi-bluffs and has reverse implied odds.\n\nEvaluation of Options:\n1. Check behind: Safely realize turn/river equity, pot control, avoid turning our hand into a bluff. Keeps pot small when behind a queen or set.  \n2. Bet sizing: With the drawy texture, a bet between 20\u201330 seems typical; however we have showdown value vs bricked ranges and the fold equity on a bet is uncertain.  \n3. Raise/fold lines not possible as no bet is live; checking is the default if we decline to bet.\n\nDecision:\nWe have marginal showdown value and need cards to fall our way; we cannot profitably charge draws large, so we keep the pot small and act with information.\n\n[Check]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nAt this stage, with a pot of 40 chips and no current bet, I am out of position (SB) and the dealer (P0) is the Big Blind. The board is Q\u2663, 8\u2663, 10\u2666, 2\u2663. My hand is 3\u2663, J\u2665.\n\nMy hand is very weak. I have no pair, no strong draws. The J\u2665 is an undercard to the Q\u2663. The 3\u2663 is very low.\nThe board has a potential flush draw (three clubs: Q\u2663, 8\u2663, 2\u2663) and several straight possibilities (e.g., JT for open-ended, 9x for gutshot).\n\nSince both players checked on the flop, it suggests that neither player had a strong hand or was looking to build the pot. This could mean P0 also has a weak hand, or they were slow-playing a monster. Given the pre-flop action, P0 only called the big blind, which also suggests a wide range, potentially weaker hands.\n\nMy current equity is very low. Betting here would be a bluff, as I have almost no showdown value. However, checking again could give P0 a free card, which could improve their hand for cheap, especially if they are on a draw. If I bet, I might be able to steal the pot, but P0 might call with any pair or a draw. If P0 has a strong hand (like a set or two pair), they will likely call or raise.\n\nGiven my hand value and position, checking is generally safer. If P0 bets, I will likely fold unless the bet is very small. Bluffing here with such a weak hand is high risk, low reward, especially against an unknown opponent in a 2-player game where bluffing frequency needs to be carefully managed. I've already shown weakness by checking the flop.\n\nDecision: Check again, as my hand has very little value and I am out of position. I want to control the pot size and avoid putting more chips in unless I improve dramatically or can determine P0's hand is weak.\n[Check]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge\n\n1. Hand strength \u2013 Q\u26602\u2666 off-suit is in the bottom 20 % of starting hands.  Heads-up this is still often good enough to see the flop, but we have reverse implied odds: if we hit a Q we will sometimes be out-kicked, and if we flop bottom pair we\u2019ll hate large bets.\n\n2. Heads-up pre-flop basics \u2013 in a 10-big-blind effective stack (effective stacks are 970 vs 1000), the small blind should open-raise a wide range and the big blind should defend a wide range.  Optimal heads-up open-raise size from the SB at 100 BB would be 2.2\u20132.5 BB, but with shallow stacks a simple min-raise to 40 is standard.  Folding Q2o pre-flop from the SB normally leaks money; limping is an exploitative option versus a passive opponent, but raising is +EV.\n\n3. Position & initiative \u2013 The SB is first to act post-flop, so playing aggressively pre-flop reduces positional disadvantage by seizing initiative and often ending the hand now.\n\n4. Chip dynamics \u2013 Stacks are quite deep relative to the pot, so leveling wars and maneuverability still matter.  Losing 20 chips is small; winning the blinds without contest is +15 chips EV.\n\n5. Meta observations \u2013 Villain folded on the turn last hand after showing weakness on the flop \u2013 indicates either straightforward play or selective aggression.  This encourages more frequent stealing from the SB.\n\nDecision \u2013 open a standard heads-up steal.\n\n[Bet 40]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nMy hand is J\u2666, 10\u2666. This is a decent drawing hand with potential for a straight and flush. However, it's currently unmade and relatively weak.\nPlayer 0 (SB) raised to 40 pre-flop. This indicates some strength, but could also be a steal attempt from the small blind.\nI am on the Button (Dealer) in this hand, which means I will act last on all post-flop streets, giving me a positional advantage.\nThe current bet is 40 from P0, and I have 10 chips in. I need to call 30 more to see the flop.\nThe pot is currently 50 (P0 40, P1 10). If I call 30, the pot will be 80. My pot odds would be 30 to 80, or 2.66:1.\nGiven my drawing hand and positional advantage, calling for this price might be acceptable to see a flop, especially since P0's raise isn't excessively large. Folding is also an option if I want to play tight, but J10 suited has some post-flop potential. Raising would be a bluff or for value if I thought my hand was strong, which it is not yet.\n\nEvaluate Options:\n1.  **[Fold]**: This is the safest option. I avoid risking more chips on a hand that isn't yet strong.\n2.  **[Call]**: I call 30 to see the flop. This is a reasonable option given my hand's potential (straight and flush draws) and my good position. The pot odds are decent.\n3.  **[Raise N]**: Raising here with J10s is generally not advisable unless I'm attempting a semi-bluff or believe Player 0 is very weak and will fold. My hand isn't strong enough for a value bet. A bluff raise risks significant chips with a speculative hand.\n\nDecision:\nGiven my drawing potential and excellent position, calling is the most appropriate action here to see the flop and re-evaluate. I have good implied odds if I hit a strong draw.\n[Call]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nMy current hand, K\u2665, 9\u2660, is a mediocre starting hand. It's an unsuited King-high, which generally plays better in heads-up situations than against multiple opponents, but still has limited potential. We are in the Small Blind position, meaning we act first post-flop. Player 0 is in the Big Blind and has a chip lead. They just raised pre-flop. Our previous folds might indicate to P0 that we are playing tight.\n\nGiven K9 unsuited and being out of position, playing defensively is often the best approach. Calling the 20 pre-flop might lead to difficult decisions on later streets, especially if we don't hit anything. We're already committed 20 chips, so calling another 10 chips to see the flop is a 2:1 pot odds call (the pot is 30, we need to add 10 to call). However, the value of our hand is weak, and being out of position diminishes our ability to control the pot or extract value. Raising would be speculative and could lead to us being called or re-raised by a stronger hand, putting us in a tougher spot. Folding is a reasonable option to conserve chips with a weak, unsuited K9 playing out of position.\n\nConsidering my stack size (950) and the opponent's (1020), losing chips on marginal hands can quickly put me at a disadvantage. It's early in the game (Hand 3 of 10), so preserving chips is important.\n\nBased on this, folding is the most prudent action.\n\n[Fold]",

We can profitably complete (or raise) with nearly any two playable cards at loose heads-up frequencies.  \n- Mem exploit: P1 just folded 3 of last 3 opportunities to defend (folded to flop bet on hand 1, folded to 3-bet on hand 2, folded to pre-flop on hand 3).

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n- **Starting Hand Selection:** My current hand 4\u2660, 10\u2666 is a weak-to-medium strength unsuited hand. It's generally not strong enough to open with from early or mid-position without a strong reason.\n- **Position:** I am in the Small Blind (SB) and am the first to act pre-flop. This is a very unfavorable position due to being out of position post-flop.\n- **Blinds:** The blinds are 10/20. I have already contributed 20 chips to the pot.\n- **Opponent Tendencies (Assumed):** So far, Player 0 has been aggressive pre-flop, raising or betting on their turn. They have also won several small pots by folding me out. However, in Hand 4, Player 0 folded to my big blind, which is unusual for an aggressive player and might indicate they had a very weak hand or are willing to fold sometimes.\n- **Pot Odds:** To call, I need to put in 0 chips since the current bet is 20 and I've already put in 20. However, the game state indicates \"Current bet: 20\", meaning I've already contributed the 20 BB as SB, and the dealer/BB is P0. This is likely a glitch in the game state reporting as I am SB and P0 is BB. It's more likely that Player 0 has put in 10 (SB) and I've put in 20 (BB), and it's Player 0's turn to act. *Re-reading the log: P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active, P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active. This means I am the Big Blind. P0 is Dealer/Small Blind and has put in 10 chips. I am the Big Blind and have put in 20 chips. Player 0 has a live bet of 10 that I need to act on.* No, the previous hand's log had P0 as SB and P1 as BB. This hand's log has P0 as Dealer/BB and P1 as SB. This is confusing. Let's assume the chip contributions listed are accurate. P0 put in 10, I put in 20. The pot is 30. Current bet is 20 (meaning I put in 20 as BB). P0 still needs to act? No, P0 is Dealer/BB, I am SB. This means I am out of position. P0 has posted 10 (SB), I have posted 20 (BB). P0 then made a bet of 0 (call). *This is extremely confusing. The game log states P0 is Dealer/BB, which makes them post 20 chips. But their current bet is 10. My position is SB, which makes me post 10 chips. But my current bet is 20. The pot is 30. This implies I am BB and P0 is SB.*\n\nLet's re-evaluate the positions and bets based on the latest line:\n`P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active`\n`P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active`\n`Pot: 30 | Current bet: 20`\n\nThis indicates:\n- Player 0 is the Dealer AND Big Blind. This would mean they post 20 chips. However, their bet is 10.\n- I am the Small Blind. This would mean I post 10 chips. However, my bet is 20.\n- The \"Current bet: 20\" means the last bet made that needs to be matched is 20.\n- The total pot is 30. If I posted 20 and P0 posted 10, this matches the pot.\n\nThis setup means I am acting as the \"Small Blind\" but have posted the \"Big Blind\" amount, and P0 is acting as \"Dealer/Big Blind\" but has posted the \"Small Blind\" amount. It's highly likely that the labels \"Dealer/BB\" and \"SB\" refer to who *was* the dealer or SB in the previous hand, or are just incorrect descriptive labels, and the actual chip contributions dictate who is SB and BB in this hand.\nGiven `P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active` and my opponent `P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active`, and `Pot: 30 | Current bet: 20`.\nThis implies that I am effectively the Big Blind (posted 20) and Player 0 is the Small Blind (posted 10). Player 0 has opened, and I need to act. No, the current bet is 20, which is what I've already posted. This means Player 0 has put in 10 (SB), and I have put in 20 (BB). It is Player 0's turn to act. If Player 0 has an active bet of 10 and I have an active bet of 20, then the \"Current bet: 20\" is my big blind. P0 has not yet acted after posting their small blind.\n\nThis is a pre-flop situation where Player 0 (SB) has already put in 10 chips, and I (BB) have put in 20 chips. It is currently Player 0's turn to act, as the \"Current bet: 20\" is the BB, and the action always starts with the player to the left of the Big Blind in subsequent betting rounds, but pre-flop, the action starts with the player to the left of the Big Blind, which is the Under the Gun position.\n\nOkay, let's assume the last line of the game output defines the *next action*.\n`P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active`\n`P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active`\n`Your hole: 4\u2660, 10\u2666`\n\nThis is a situation where I am SB and P0 is BB. So I posted 10, and P0 posted 20. The current bet listed is 20. This means the action is on me. I put in 10, the current bet is 20. I need to put in 10 more to call.\n\n- **Hand Strength:** 4s10d is a very weak hand. It has some flush potential if spades come (which it doesn't, 4s). It's a disconnect. Very little playability.\n- **Position:** I am in the Small Blind (SB) and will be out of position post-flop if I call. This is a significant disadvantage with a weak hand.\n- **Pre-flop Action:** No action has occurred yet beyond the blinds.\n- **Opponent Tendencies:** Player 0 has shown aggression but also folded once. They also won small pots when I folded.\n\nGiven my weak hand (4\u2660, 10\u2666) and being out of position, playing this hand is not profitable. The chips are small, 10 chips to call to a 30 chip pot. My implied odds are terrible because I'll be out of position with a weak hand. Folding is the standard correct play here.\n\nDecision: Fold.\n[Fold]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge\n\nKey principles that apply right now:\n- Position & Stack depth \u2013 I am in the SB with 1030 chips (51.5 bb) and the effective stack is 940 bb (\u224847 bb). Medium stacks in heads-up play usually favor post-flop skill edges, not pre-flop all-ins.\n- Starting hand strength \u2013 4\u2663 10\u2666 is in the weaker 40 % of heads-up ranges. It flops some equity (straight & gut-shot draws) but plays poorly under heavy aggression.  \n- Heads-up pre-flop frequencies \u2013 From the SB (first to act) a common balanced strategy is to raise \u224865 % of hands, limp \u224825-30 %, and fold \u22485-10 %. 4\u2663 10\u2666 is a clear raise-or-fold hand, never a limp, because its equity 3-bet-shoved is poor.\n- Pot odds vs. fold equity \u2013 The pot is 30 (1.5 bb) and it costs 20 (1 bb) to call my own blind that is already posted. Folding costs no further chips; raising to a standard 2.5\u20133 bb (50\u201360) risks more significant chips.\n- Dynamics so far: Aggressive image. I raised and took it in Hand 2, opponent has folded to aggression repeatedly. Maintaining fold equity is still valuable.\n\nApply Knowledge\n\n- 4\u2663 10\u2666 is below the SB open-raising threshold versus a competent opponent who can 3-bet shove 45 bb wide.  \n- I only need to win pots worth 20 chips to stay ahead over the remaining 4 hands; taking small uncontested pots is more valuable than risking 75 chips here.  \n- Folding this specific holding preserves stack depth, avoids marginal spots, and keeps my overall steal frequency credible because my earlier raises were not pure bluffs.\n\nDecision\n\n[Fold]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nMy current hand is A heart 10 spade. This is a decent starting hand, especially for a short-handed game. An Ace is a strong card, and suited connectors or a high card with a decent kicker can often be played.\nHowever, I am out of position (SB) and facing a bet from the dealer/BB. They have the positional advantage throughout the hand.\nGiven the blinds are 10/20, my current bet is 20 chips, and the pot is 30.\nI have 950 chips remaining. P0 has 1020 chips.\nIn previous hands, P0 has been aggressive, often winning by folding. I've been relatively passive.\n\nOptions:\n1.  **Call 10:** This keeps the pot small and allows me to see the flop cheaply. With A-10, I can hit a good flop. However, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n2.  **Raise:** Raising pre-flop with A-10 can accomplish a few things:\n    *   Pot control: If P0 folds, I win the blinds.\n    *   Value: If P0 calls, it builds the pot with a decent hand.\n    *   Information: P0's reaction (call, re-raise, fold) gives me an idea of their hand strength.\n    *   Strength representation: A raise will represent a stronger hand than a call.\n3.  **Fold:** Folding is an option if I believe my hand isn't strong enough or if P0 is likely to re-raise aggressively, putting me in a difficult spot. However, A-10 suited is generally too strong to fold pre-flop from the SB when only facing the BB.\n\nConsidering the A-10s, it's a hand that can flop well (top pair, two pair, flush draw). Being out of position is a disadvantage, so trying to gain control of the pot or get P0 to fold early can be beneficial. Given P0's recent aggressive play (multiple wins by folding from me), a raise here could be a good counter-strategy to show resistance and potentially take down the pot immediately or with a strong flop. A standard raise would be to 3-4x the current bet, so to 60-80 chips. Given I've been relatively passive, a raise here might be effective.\nHowever, raising to 40 would be a smaller, less committal raise if I want to just test the waters or if P0 has been folding to small raises. A larger raise (e.g., to 60 or 80) would put more pressure on P0.\n\nLet's go for a standard raise to build the pot and assert some aggression. A raise to 60 (3x my current bet) feels appropriate.\n[Raise 60]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\nCurrent Situation: Early into a 10-hand heads-up match (Hand 8/10). I am Small-Blind; blinds 10/20. I hold 8\u2665 10\u2663, effective stacks 50 BB (1000 vs 970). No pre-flop action yet.\n\nKey principles for heads-up poker with marginal holdings:\n\n1. Heads-up hand ranges widen dramatically. Almost any two cards can be played profitably in position, and many hands are playable OOP. Suited/connected hands gain significant value.\n\n2. Stack-to-pot ratio is ~32 (20/40 to play). A raise here keeps SPR high, so future streets remain playable.\n\n3. Hand potential: 8\u2665 10\u2663 is J-high suited one-gapper (often referred to as T8s). It flops gut-shots (97x), 2BDFD (hearts), weak top-pairs, and straight-draws, giving dependable equity.\n\n4. Positional disadvantage: As SB I am out of position post-flop. Rely on aggressive 2.5-3.5 BB raise to take control, reduce opponent\u2019s positional edge.\n\n5. Fold equity: Opponent (P1) checked pre-flop but has demonstrated willingness to fold to early aggression (folded to our flop bet in Hand 1, pre-flop folds past few hands). Light 3-bet by villain once (hand 7) is still uncommon.\n\n6. Balancing: From SB, mixing open-raises (2 variants: 3\u00d7 and 2.2\u00d7) plus occasional limp keeps range unexploitable. Here we opt for standard raise.\n\nCalculation: Raise to 60 (3 BB) risks 60 to win 30, so needs 60 / (60 + 30) = 66.7 % fold equity to profit immediately. Given villain\u2019s current leak, this is reasonable, and we have playable equity when called or 3-bet.\n\nDecision:\n\n[Bet 60]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nMy current hand (8h, 7s) is a weak speculative hand. It has some potential for a straight or flush, but only if the board runs out favorably. This is especially true given the unsuited nature.\nWe are in the Small Blind (SB) position, which means we act first post-flop. This is generally a disadvantageous position as we don't have information about our opponent's actions.\nMy opponent (P0) is in the Big Blind (BB), which is a stronger position.\nThe current bet is 20 chips, and I have already put in 20 chips as the SB. The pot is 30.\nGiven the hand strength and position, a fold is generally the most prudent move against an opponent who has the positional advantage. Calling would put us in a tough spot post-flop with a weak hand and no positional advantage. Raising is generally only for strong hands or for stealing the blinds, which is not advisable with 8-7 unsuited, especially when facing a tighter opponent or one who might call easily.\n\nDecision:\n[Fold]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge\n\n1. Fundamental pre-flop ranges in heads-up\n   - From the SB with 30 bb effective (1.5 bb in the pot dead money) optimal ranges open ~55 %\u201360 % of hands.  \n   - 10\u2663 2\u2663 is in the \u201cutility fold\u201d category (bottom 15 %); its single-suited T-high is dominated by random hands and has poor playability.\n\n2. Stack-to-pot ratio (SPR) & future streets\n   - Pot = 30, effective stacks after posting = 940 (P1) vs 1020 (P0).  \n   - Initial open to standard 2.2\u20132.5 bb (40\u201350 chips) raises our risk to 40\u201350 chips every time we open; negative-EV hands magnify the loss if called.\n\n3. Exploitation of villain\u2019s tendencies so far\n   - P1 has folded to pre-flop aggression five of eight opportunities (62.5 %).  \n   - However, P1 also 4 bb-raised once (Hand 7) showing willingness to 3-bet aggressively\u2014so \u201cauto-profit\u201d steals don\u2019t work every time.\n\n4. ICM / endgame perspective\n   - Final hand, no future monetary jumps; chip-EV = $-EV. GTO defends normal ranges without ICM pressure, but exploit still applies.\n\n5. Rake-free utility calculation for 10\u2663 2\u2663\n   - Versus a ~60 % defend range P1 continues with \u2248 1100/1326 \u00d7 ~60 % \u2248 50 % of hands.  \n   - Equity vs that range \u2248 32 % in hot-and-cold pre-flop simulation.  \n   - Pre-flop EV of a mini-raise to 60 chips (0.5x pot, aggressive sizing we used earlier) = (0.38 win pot + 0.62 lose \u2013 raise) \u2243 \u20130.7 bb in expectation.\n\nConclusion for this spot\n10\u2663 2\u2663 falls outside every reasonable steal range; opening it loses chips even against a loose defender. The best exploit remains acknowledging P1\u2019s tight overall fold frequency across the session, but even that frequency doesn\u2019t turn this trash hand profitable. Discard and save every chip\u2014there is no upside left after this hand.\n\nAction\n\n[Fold]",
