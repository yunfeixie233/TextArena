      "response": "### Generated Knowledge:\n\n1. **Starting Hand Strength**: My hole cards are 7\u2666 and 6\u2660, which gives me a suited connector potential for a straight, but they're not particularly strong against a raise. In many scenarios, this hand is considered speculative in nature.\n\n2. **Position Awareness**: I\u2019m in the small blind position, which means I have less information compared to the player in the big blind. I need to assess their aggression and willingness to play strong hands.\n\n3. **Opponent\u2019s Action**: Player 0 just raised to 60 chips. This shows strength; they are likely holding a decent hand. The pot is now 80 chips, meaning I could win a reasonable amount if I improve.\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: The pot offers 80 chips, and I need to call 40 chips to continue (since I've already invested 20). This gives me pot odds of 80:40, or 2:1. While speculative hands can sometimes justify a call, with less than optimal positioning, I need to be cautious.\n\n5. **Equity vs. Risk**: Calling may allow for drawing opportunities, but with a low equity hand against a probable strong range from Player 0, it is crucial to consider the risks of being aggressive out of position.\n\n6. **Future Betting Scenarios**: If I decide to call, I must also have a clear plan for post-flop play if the board doesn't connect with my hand. I must be prepared either to fold to further aggression or play well with my draws.\n\n### Decision:\n\nConsidering the above principles, my hole cards present low equity and limited winning potential against a raise, especially out of position. While I could call to see the flop, there's a risk of being outplayed.\n\nTherefore, I will choose to:\n\n**[Fold]**",

Short-stack heads-up ranges \u2013 With only 980 chips (\u224849 BB effective) after Hand 1, we are still deeper than typical push/fold territory, so we can continue to use a solid 45-50 BB heads-up opening range.  \n2. Button vs Big Blind dynamics \u2013 Ranges widen dramatically heads-up; the SB (us here) is on the button for all practical purposes and should raise a majority of hands, while the BB can profitably defend with 35-45 % equity or better.  \n3. Hand selection \u2013 From the SB we profit by attacking with anything that flops at least some equity: our worst trash (T2o) still only needs to force 35\u201340 % folds to be +EV when we raise to 2.5\u20133 BB.  \n4. Stack-size leverage \u2013 Raising to 60 (3\u00d7) keeps the SPR low future streets; our stack is big enough to apply pressure but not so deep we must worry about future tricky decisions.  \n5.

Typical BB defence in heads-up is 60-65 % when facing 3\u00d7, so the raise is profitable.  \n6.

      "response": "**Generated Knowledge:**\n\n1. **Starting Hand Strength**: In Texas Hold'em, hands like 10\u2665, 4\u2660 are generally considered weak unless they connect well with the flop. They are unsuited and don't form a strong combination (like a straight or flush).\n\n2. **Position**: As the Big Blind (BB), you have already invested chips and have the option to either call, raise, or fold. Position is crucial; being the last to act in the betting round allows you to better gauge your opponent's actions.\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: The current pot is 70 chips, and to call, you must invest 60 chips to see the next card, giving you pot odds of 70:60. This means if you hit something on the flop that can improve your hand, you\u2019ll need to hit it with a reasonable return given the pot size.\n\n4. **Aggressive Opponent**: Player 0 has already raised the previous hand and has bet 60 chips now. This suggests aggression; they may have a strong hand or are trying to pressure you to fold.\n\n5. **Fold Equity**: If I were to raise after Player 0's bet of 60 chips, I would need to assess whether I believe I can get them to fold. Given my weak hand, the likelihood of winning the pot with a bluff is also low since Player 0 has already shown strength.\n\n**Decision Evaluation:**\n\nGiven the weak nature of my hand (10\u2665, 4\u2660) and the significant bet of 60 chips in front of me, my best option is to fold this hand. The risk-to-reward ratio does not favor me in this case, as I would need to hit the flop hard to have any chance of winning.\n\n**Decision:**\n[Fold]",

      "response": "**Generated Knowledge:**\nIn Texas Hold'em, understanding hand strength is crucial. Your hole cards are 3\u2665 and K\u2663, which means you have a king with a low card. This is a mixed hand since you have a strong high card (King) and a low card (3). Kings are strong when compared to other random hands, but the 3 diminishes the hand's overall value unless you hit a two-pair or straight.\n\nWhen you're in the small blind position against a player who has just completed the big blind for 20 chips and is now showing a 10-chip raise, it indicates they may have strong hands or simply want to apply pressure. The betting pattern shows they're willing to bet aggressively, so it's essential to evaluate whether your hand can stand against their potential holdings.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Position Matters:** Being in the small blind means you act first post-flop, which can be a disadvantage if you play a weak hand.\n2. **Hand Value:** K high can be strong, but without a suitable kicker or connection to the board, it can be risky.\n3. **Chip Management:** You have 950 chips. Preserving your stack is essential in early rounds.\n4. **Bluffing Potential:** Given the dynamics and bet size, there's a potential opportunity to bluff or get out if the hand doesn't develop favorably.\n\n**Decision Evaluation:**\nWith K\u2663 and 3\u2665 and the current raised bet being aggressive, my options are limited. The best course of action seems to be:\n\n- I could call the 10-chip bet if I want to see the flop and hope for favorable cards.\n- However, given the hand's risk and my position, folding seems prudent.\n\nTaking into consideration the potential hand development and my current position, I will choose to **[Fold]**.",

      "response": "**Generated Knowledge:**\nAt this stage in the game, some key poker principles and strategies apply:\n\n1. **Position**: Being in the small blind (SB) gives you a disadvantage as you will act first post-flop. This implies that many players may raise more liberally when they're in a position of power (like the dealer/big blind).\n\n2. **Hand Strength**: My current hand (3\u2660, 6\u2663) is relatively weak. It does not connect with high-ranking combinations like pairs, high cards, or strong drawing hands. The chance of hitting a strong hand post-flop from this hand is low.\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: The current pot is 70 chips with a bet of 60 chips. This means I would need to put in 60 chips to potentially win 70. The pot odds here are 1.17 to 1; however, considering my hand strength, this is not favorable.\n\n4. **Player Behavior**: Player 0 has been aggressive, raising and betting frequently. They seem to be playing a tight range, so bluffing may be less frequent, implying they could have a strong hand.\n\n5. **Tournament Tactics**: Since this is a multi-hand tournament scenario, folding weaker hands early can conserve chips for better opportunities as the game progresses.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the logical decision is to fold.\n\n**Decision**: \n[Fold]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge:\nIn this situation, we're in the pre-flop stage of Texas Hold'em, where strategic decisions largely rely on the following principles:\n\n1. **Starting Hand Strength**: The hand you hold, 8\u2663 and K\u2666, is considered relatively strong. It's suited and contains a high card, which can help in forming pairs or kickers.\n\n2. **Position**: As the Big Blind (BB), you've already invested chips into the pot. This gives you some incentive to play the hand since you're already committed to it compared to being out of position.\n\n3. **Opponent's Raising Pattern**: Player 0 has been aggressive, raising consistently, indicating a potentially strong hand range. Understanding their tendencies can help in making your decision.\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: The current pot is 30 chips, and the last bet made by Player 0 is 60 chips, meaning you would need to call 60 chips to stay in the game. This gives you a pot of 90 chips after your call, providing a potential reward that you should weigh against your hand strength.\n\n5. **Image and Psychology**: Since you have folded previously, you may be perceived as tight, which could affect your opponents' perception of your raises or bets going forward. You may have some leverage to see how Player 0 reacts without risking too many chips, given their aggressive style.\n\n### Decision Evaluation:\nYou have a decent hand with 8\u2663, K\u2666. Although it's not a premium hand, its potential coupled with your current position offers opportunities:\n\n- Calling could allow you to see the flop with a good chance of hitting something useful, considering your investment in the pot.\n- Raising would represent strength and could either take the pot down uncontested or allow you to play the hand aggressively if you hit the flop well.\n\nGiven that this is the fifth hand of a total of ten, it's sensible to try to build a stack while keeping mindful of not overcommitting yourself with weaker hands early in the game where stack sizes are still relatively high.\n\n### Deciding Action:\nI decide to [Call] 60 chips to see the flop. \n\nThis offers a good blend of seeing more cards while maximizing your engagement in a hand with significant potential, especially with a high card like K\u2666.",

Your bottom-end suited connectors (6\u26635\u2663) sit in the upper-half 6max push/fold chart (\u2248+2.5 bb equity vs random).

That is extreme face-up tightness.

      "response": "**Generate Knowledge:**\n\nIn this poker scenario, here are several key principles and concepts that should guide the decision-making process:\n\n1. **Starting Hand Evaluation**: The hand (8\u2663, K\u2666) is considerably stronger than the previous hands I\u2019ve held. The King paired with an 8 is more likely to connect well with the board against opponents.\n\n2. **Position and Aggression**: I'm in the Small Blind position and facing a raise from Player 0. Generally, in this position, I have limited options because my hand is already partially committed to the pot. \n\n3. **Bet Sizing**: Player 0 has raised to 50, which is a significant amount compared to the current pot (70 chips). Considering that I have a decent hand, I should weigh the potential returns against the risk of going against a likely stronger range from Player 0.\n\n4. **Pot Odds and Implied Odds**: If I call, I must consider the pot odds I'm getting. The pot is 70 chips when I put in 50, which gives me a decent rate of return. However, given the current bet, if I call, I should also calculate future bets when the board comes out.\n\n5. **Psychology and Betting Patterns**: Player 0 has shown aggression, raising in multiple rounds. It could indicate a strong hand, but it also could be a bluff or a semi-bluff. Understanding Player 0's tendencies could affect my decision.\n\n6. **Future Streets Consideration**: If I call, I should be prepared to evaluate how the flop may hit both my hand and potential ranges from my opponent. \n\n**Evaluate Options:**\n\nCurrently facing a bet of 50 with a strong hand (8\u2663, K\u2666) against Player 0\u2019s raise:\n- **Fold**: Giving up on this relatively strong hand would be too conservative, especially since it's not a total dog against a wide range.\n- **Call**: This is a viable option. I can see the flop and hope to hit a strong hand, but I need to outline a plan for post-flop play depending on board texture.\n- **Raise**: Raising could put pressure on Player 0 but might risk isolating against stronger hands. \n\nGiven these considerations, the decision leans towards calling, as it allows me to see the flop with a potentially solid hand without over-committing my chips.\n\n**Make Decision:**\n\nI choose to **[Call]** 50.",

      "response": "**Generated Knowledge:**\nIn Texas Hold'em, the value of your hand depends on the community cards and your hole cards. A few key principles relevant to this situation include:\n\n1. **Drawing Hands vs Made Hands**: In this case, my hand (8\u2663, K\u2666) has improved with the flop showing (J\u2660, 7\u2663, K\u2665). I've made top pair (Kings) with a potential to improve with a straight draw involving the 10 and Q if those cards come.\n\n2. **Position**: As the player in the Small Blind (SB), I am out of position for the rest of the hand. Thus, I'll need to consider whether to lead out with a bet or check to gauge my opponent's strength.\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: The pot is at 100 chips, and my current effective stack is 890 chips, so there's a good amount to win with potentially low risk. \n\n4. **Opponent's Range**: Since my opponent seems to be aggressive based on previous rounds, they could be betting with a wide range of hands.\n\n5. **Bet Sizing**: If I choose to bet, I want to protect my hand while also giving my opponent a chance to continue with weaker hands. A medium-sized bet could extract value from worse pairs or draws.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the information and my hand strength, I am inclined to lead out with a bet to protect my top pair and to potentially extract value. A bet around 50-70 chips could be a good range to entice a call from my opponent without scaring them away.\n\n**Action:**\n[Bet 50]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge (relevant to this flop spot):\n1. Range advantage & flop texture  \n   - You open from the big-blind with 56s-good hands that connect with middling boards and sometimes steal. Villain called in the small-blind, so his continuing range is weighted toward medium pairs (55-TT, maybe Jx), broadways, and some suited connectors.  \n   - The flop K\u2665 J\u2660 7\u2663 hits your perceived range reasonably (has plenty of Kx, Jx, AK, KJ, 77-JJ) and Villain is immediately donk-leading 50 into 150 (1/3 pot). A small donk-lead is often a \u201cmiddling\u201d hand looking to set its own price\u2014Jx, Tx, 8x, maybe 66-88 trying not to face a big c-bet, or occasionally a trap with KJ/77.\n\n2. Equity vs. Villain range  \n   - 65cc has back-door flush and straight potential but currently only has 4 outs at best (I can hit a 6 or a 5 for trips or two-pair only if a 6 and 5 both land by river) so equity is terrible (<15%).  \n   - Even against small showdown value hands like J9 or 98 you are behind; against Kx, 7x or better you\u2019re drawing to 3-5 outs.\n\n3. Spr & betting lines  \n   - Effective stacks ~840-1010. The pot-to-stack ratio on the flop is 150/840 \u2248 5.6. That means decision is not committed\u2014easy fold without significant equity.\n\n4. Tournament dynamic (2-player, 10-hand match)  \n   - You already have a 130-chip cushion. Folding keeps that healthy gap without risking extra chips in a poor spot.  \n   - Long-run chip EV is high when you avoid playing large pots on weak draws, especially when villain shows aggression on favorable boards for him.\n\nDecision:\nNo reason to continue; we have minimal equity and the board favors his range far more than ours.\n\n[Fold]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. Tournament equity: After 5 of 10 hands you hold 990 vs 980 chips\u2014about 50 % \u2013 50 % stacks. Any chips you lose cost much more in proportional equity than they gain, so now is not the time to take big gambles without solid equity.\n\n2. Hand strength vs. anticipated range:\n   - You hold A4o in the SB against a single opponent who has so far:\n     \u2013 folded to four consecutive 3-bets/raises,\n     \u2013 then defended pre-flop once (vs Q5s) and fired a flop bet on K-J-7 rainbow.\n   - Likely BB defend range after 10 chips in: any pair 22+, most Ax, many Broadway hands, broad-suited connectors open-ended.\n\n3. Position & initiative: In heads-up play, the SB is actually in position post-flop (p1 acts first on every street starting with the flop). That implies:\n   - Checking 100 % OOP is not mandatory; you can bet or raise to take the pot right away.\n   - When you do have a good Broadway ace (A4 blocks AA, AK) you generally want to punish limped BB pots.\n\n4. Stack-to-pot ratio & bet sizing:\n   - SPR pre-flop is >30, so we have room to manoeuvre.\n   - Min-raise from SB (20\u219240 total, i.e. a 20-chip raise) lets you steal small pots without risking too many chips. A larger raise risks 60\u201380 and commits more of your later stack.\n\n5. Metagame adjustment: Opponent has shown willingness to:\n   - Fold to 3-bets but not 100 % (he called one steal).\n   - Fire flop bets after defending; hence raising him now may get re-raised on board textures we dislike.\n\n6. Equity estimates vs loose BB defend range (top 60 %):\n   A4o \u2248 57 %, giving clear pre-flop \u2022value\u2022 when raised/re-raised\uff1bthe hand is clearly ahead of his calling range.\n\n7. Tournament tactics for middle stages: Small-ball aggression keeps blinds from eroding stack. Look for small edges, fold garbage instead of bloating the pot with medium-strength holdings.\n\nApply Knowledge \u2013 Decision Tree:\nRaise small (20 more \u2192 40 total) balances risk/reward; if he fold you net 20 chips and stay even harder to exploit. If flat-called you still have the initiative and position post-flop.\n\nAction: Raise to a number that is exactly 40 (a 20-chip raise over his big-blind facing a SB that has bet 20). According to the required format we need to write the 40-chip amount as the absolute raise size. The smallest valid absolute raise line is therefore:\n\n[Raise 40]",

      "response": "**Generate Knowledge:**\nIn this hand of Texas Hold'em, I am holding 2\u2663 and 4\u2665, which are low ranked cards that do not connect to each other. I'm facing a raise from Player 0 to 60 chips, having required 60 chips to call. Here are some key concepts that apply to my situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength:** With cards 2 and 4, I have a weak hand. The strength of hands at pre-flop is crucial; in general, low suited connectors are better when in position and in multi-way pots.\n\n2. **Position:** I am in the Big Blind position, which gives me a slight advantage because I get to see what Player 0 does after the flop. However, this advantage is less useful with weak cards.\n\n3. **Pot Odds:** The pot is currently at 70 chips, and if I call, I\u2019ll have to put in 60 chips. The likelihood of making a good hand post-flop with my cards is low.\n\n4. **Fold Equity:** By calling, I'm risking a significant portion of my stack for a chance at a weak hand. Folding would maintain my chip count, putting me in a better position for later hands.\n\n5. **Aggression:** My opponent has shown aggression by raising pre-flop. If they have a stronger hand (which they likely do with a raise), my chances of winning this hand are slim.\n\n**Decision:**\nConsidering the weak nature of my hand (2\u2663, 4\u2665), the aggression shown by Player 0, and the pot odds not being favorable, I believe it's best to avoid committing chips unnecessarily.\n\n**Action:** \n[Fold]",

      "response": "**Generate Knowledge:**\nIn this current situation of a Texas Hold'em game, we need to focus on a few important principles:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Starting hand evaluation is crucial. In this hand, my hole cards are 2\u2666, 4\u2666. This is a very weak starting hand, often referred to as a \"baby\" hand or \"connector\", but mostly low in value overall.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the Small Blind position. This means I will be first to act before the flop, which is usually a disadvantage because it limits my ability to react to other players' actions.\n\n3. **Pot Odds and Bet Sizing**: The current bet is 20, and the pot is 30. If I decide to call, I will be risking 20 for a chance to win 30. As the hand stands, my incentives to call would be very limited due to the weak hand.\n\n4. **Psychological Insights**: Recognizing betting patterns can hint at the strength of an opponent's hand\u2014Player 0 has been fairly aggressive, raising often, which could indicate a stronger range of hands.\n\n5. **Fold Equity**: Sometimes folding is a winning strategy in poker. Given my current hand and position, this could be a typical spot for me to exercise that option.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\nBased on the knowledge gained:\n\n- **Folding**: Given I have 2\u2666, 4\u2666, which is weak and facing aggression from my opponent, folding is a wise choice.\n\n- **Calling or Raising**: These options are not viable due to the poor hand strength and potential loss of chips.\n\nTherefore, I will choose to **Fold**.\n\n**Decision:**\n[Fold]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Heads-up pre-flop ranges widen dramatically**  \n   In heads-up play, even hands like K-7 offsuit are in the top 30 % of all starting hands (167 combinations of 1,326). From the Small Blind, we\u2019re forced to put 20 chips into a 30-chip pot against a wide range, making folding punitive.\n\n2. **Stack\u2013pot ratio (SPR) and exploitability**  \n   Effective stacks are now 950 chips and the pot is 30 \u21d2 SPR \u2248 32. Post-flop playability is almost irrelevant; the decisive edge will almost always come from pre-flop aggression when stacks are this deep.\n\n3. **Opponent\u2019s demonstrated leak**  \n   So far Villain has folded to every 3-bet except once (Hand 5), where he called then led the flop. His fold-to-steal rate is > 85 %. He has also never 3-bet pre-flop, indicating a tight, largely face-up range.\n\n4. **Position dictates aggression**  \n   As the Small Blind, we act first pre-flop but will be out of position post-flop, so we prefer to take the pot down now rather than play a bloated pot OOP with a mediocre hand.\n\n5. **Bet-sizing leverage**  \n   With a 950\u20131020 chip lead, we can put real pressure on a single opponent. A 3-bet to 60 chips (4\u00d7 the current 20-chip bet) continues our pattern and forces Villain to risk about 6 % of his stack\u2014more than he\u2019s shown willingness to commit with anything short of premiums.\n\n6. **Hand strength relative to heads-up range**  \n   K-7 offsuit is ahead of the 63 % of hands Villain is likely opening (essentially any two cards except the worst 10\u201315 %). Raising capitalizes on both card strength and fold equity.\n\nApply the knowledge:\n\nRaise is the highest EV line. Folding wastes the equity of a hand that dominates his range; calling yields a mediocre flop and invites trouble out of position. Our historical pattern (open/raise 60) has almost always taken the pot, so stick with it while stacks remain deep and Villain remains tight.\n\nDecision:  \n[Raise 60]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge:\n1. **Starting Hand Evaluation**: In Texas Hold'em, hand strength is crucial. You currently have 2\u2665, 8\u2663, which is a relatively weak starting hand. Generally, hands like 2-8 are considered \"trash\" hands unless in a late position when you could potentially bluff.\n   \n2. **Position Strategy**: As the big blind (BB), you are in a defensive position. You need a stronger hand to justify calling or raising, especially with the current bet of 80 chips from Player 0.\n\n3. **Pot Odds and Implied Odds**: The pot is currently 90 chips, and you need to call 80 to stay in the hand. Your immediate pot odds are about 1.125:1, meaning you'd need to win the hand over 47% of the time to make the call profitable. Given your hand's weakness, this becomes more complex as both pot odds and any potential future betting must be considered.\n\n4. **Bluffing Potential**: Given that you're facing Player 0's substantial raise, if you were to consider any bluff, it would need very careful timing. However, betting with a weak hand is risky.\n\n5. **Aggression and Betting Patterns**: Player 0 has been aggressive, tending to raise when they are in the pot. This information can be leveraged against their behavior, but only if you had a strong hand.\n\n### Decision Evaluation:\nIn this scenario, given the hand strength (2\u2665, 8\u2663) and the aggressive action from Player 0, your hand is not strong enough to justify calling or raising. Based on the above factors and your current chip stack (950 chips), the best course of action is to:\n\n**Action**\n[Fold]",

ICM / tourney strategy for 3 hands left, 2-handed  \n   With 10 bb effective stacks, pushing marginal holdings out of position increases variance without adding much guaranteed value. The pot growth you create needs a certain frequency of successful steals > ~70 % (given pot odds) to merit the risk with rags. Villain appears to over-fold, so smaller bluff sizes or giving up can both be profitable.  \n5. Decision tree (out-of-position, 2-4o)  \n   - Fold: worst equity hand, risks nothing.  \n   - Pot-allow-limp strategy (check) would let Villain see free flop with 100 % range; 2-4o flops poorly.  \n   - Limp-fold any flop: at least limits risk to one SB.  \n   Conclusion: Check-fold > bluff-size > bet large; the reverse is more tolerable when in position or deeper.  \n\nDecision  \n[Check]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. Two-player dynamics: In heads-up play, ranges are much wider; any ace, broadway, or suited connector is playable, and bluffing frequency should be higher compared to full-ring.\n\n2. Current hand strength: 2\u2666 4\u2665 is at the absolute bottom of any reasonable heads-up range \u2013 unsuited, non-connected, low card ranks. It\u2019s essentially the \u201cgarbage\u201d portion of the chart.\n\n3. Stack-to-pot ratio (SPR): Effective stack = 930, pot = 30. SPR \u2248 31, which is \u201cdeep-stack\u201d territory. A 3-bet bluff would need to risk ~60\u201380 chips, which is a small portion of the effective stack, so fold equity is less valuable than with shorter stacks.\n\n4. Position & betting sequence: You are in the big blind (out of position) and facing a 20-chip bet (1 SB) from the small blind. Therefore \u201cfold\u201d, \u201ccall\u201d, or \u201craise\u201d are all legal, but \u201ccheck\u201d is not.\n\n5. Opponent reads: Opponent has folded to most of your aggression so far but did call one pre-flop raise earlier and successfully took the pot on the flop. This suggests opponent isn\u2019t completely tight and may be capable of floating with marginal hands. However, exploitatively you have already shown a lot of aggression, so another raise here might actually get credibility/credit.\n\n6. ICM / tournament stage: You already have a big chip lead (1040 vs 930). With only two hands left, preserving that lead is valuable; unnecessary risk with 72o-type holdings is not.\n\n7. Equity vs SB default range: 24o has ~28 % equity against a very wide SB open range (e.g., top 80 % of hands). That raw equity is borderline for a call, but it has severe reverse-implied odds and poor playability out of position post-flop.\n\nApply knowledge \u2192 decision:\n\nHands like 24o are easy folds out of position facing a small blind steal unless table dynamics (e.g., SB folding >80 %) are extremely favorable. Given the stack depth and our chip lead, the risk does not justify the reward.\n\n[Fold]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. Stack dynamics  \n   I have 1020 chips, P1 has 950. My chip lead is modest\u2014roughly 51 vs 49 of all chips\u2014but still the largest advantage I have had the entire match.\n\n2. Short-stack tournament endings  \n   This is the final hand. Any chip I lose goes straight to my opponent and swings overall chip counts. Playing to avoid catastrophic losses is therefore more important than marginal chip gains.\n\n3. Opening-range expectations after observed folds  \n   P1 repeatedly folded to small-to-medium raises; he has only once put money past the flop and that was when he check/raised the flop heads-up (hand 5). His fold-to-c-bet frequency is near 100 % over 8 small-bet 3BB+ c-bets. That allows me to use a wider raising range when I am first to act, but also means P1\u2019s lone flop check/raise is a big warning sign\u2014he does not continue light.\n\n4. My specific holding  \n   7\u2663 4\u2660 offsuit, one gap but no suitedness, very low equity against any reasonable range. Even against a conservative 40 % BTN/BB limp-range (22+,A2s+,K6s+,Q8s+,J9s+,T8s+,A8o+,K9o+,QJo) I only have ~29 % equity pre-flop and will be out-of-position on every street after the flop.\n\n5. Deep enough stack vs blinds ratio  \n   Stacks remain deep (51\u201347.5 big blinds). There is no pressure to gamble with a marginal holding.\n\n6. Summary  \n   - I have a big chip lead on the last hand.  \n   - The downside of investing chips with 7\u2663 4\u2660 is huge\u2014losing even 60 chips tilts the overall chip total materially.  \n   - Up to now P1\u2019s folds indicate he understand his disadvantage and is looking for a spot or giving up; a speculative raise here is unnecessary and dangerous.  \n   - Even if I fold, the tournament ends with me holding 1020 vs P1\u2019s 980, a victory.\n\nDecision: [Fold]",
