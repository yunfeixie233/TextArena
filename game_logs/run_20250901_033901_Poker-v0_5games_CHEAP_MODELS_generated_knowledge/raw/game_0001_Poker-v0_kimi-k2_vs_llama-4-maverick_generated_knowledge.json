      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n- Heads-up ranges & equity: From the big-blind with 35-off, raw equity vs a wide small-blind range is only ~37 %.  \n- Pot odds: Villain has laid 20 chips; calling costs 10 more into a 30-chip pot \u2192 immediate pot odds 3:1 \u2192 need roughly 25 % equity to break-even. Our ~37 % equity meets this threshold.  \n- Position: No post-flop position hurts because we\u2019ll act first on every street. For speculative hands, realizing equity is therefore harder.  \n- Stack-to-pot ratio (SPR): Effective stack 980 ; pot pre-call = 30, so SPR after a call would be 980 \u00f7 (30+10) = 24.5 \u2014 very deep, implying a small call is inexpensive relative to stacks.  \n- Ranging: SB heads-up opens a wide, virtually any-two type range; our holding blocks less of a strong part of that range.  \n- Tournament survival: 10-hand match, blinds tiny, so chip preservation is not yet critical; however discipline vs garbage hands remains important.  \n- Outcome profiles:  \n  \u2013 Folding costs 0 and forfeits 10 already posted, keeps initiative low.  \n  \u2013 Calling 10 retains maximum stack depth but risks playing out of position with a very weak hand.  \n  \u2013 Raising creates additional risk without a strong hand; 3-bet from SB would likely force us to fold after investing more.  \n\nEvaluation:\n1. Pot odds easily justify a call if we could play perfectly post-flop.  \n2. But post-flop OOP complexity and reverse-implied odds (weak one-pair, A-high boards, dominated flushes) significantly depress our realized equity.  \n3. Deep effective stacks amplify the importance of skill edge; without read on opponent, cautious approach is prudent.  \n4. Raising (building a pot with 3-7o OOP) is clearly \u2013EV.  \n\nDecision: Fold the junk. Sacrifice the 10 chips already wagered rather than risk off-suit trash OOP.",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. Starting hands 3\u26667\u2660 from the big-blind (OOP) vs a single opponent \u2192 this combo is in the bottom 15 % of all Hold\u2019em hands.  \n   - Hot-and-cold equity vs a 100 % range is ~36 % at best.  \n   - Flops poorly (rarely makes straights or flushes; top-pair is weak).  \n\n2. Action recap:  \n   - Pot = 30 (our 10 BB already posted).  \n   - Effective extra to call = 10 chips (call 20 total \u2013 we\u2019ve already put in 10).  \n   - Pot-odds = 10 / (30 + 10) = 25 %.  \n   - Reverse-implied odds are bad because we\u2019ll often hit second-best hands and lose additional chips post-flop OOP.\n\n3. Tournament context:  \n   - 10-hand sprint; survival value slightly elevated vs chip accumulation early.  \n   - Future blinds increase relative to stacks\u2014avoid bloating pots with marginal holdings.\n\n4. Psychological/game-flow insight: Heads-up pre-flop, many players raise wide from SB; anything above ~40 % would include our hand in an equity-deficit situation. We cannot profitably defend 3-7o for 25 % of the pot with this reverse-implied-odds profile.\n\nDecision:\nWe are facing a bet of 20; our options are [Call] or [Fold]. [Check] is invalid.\n\nExpected value of calling is negative once reverse-implied odds are considered; folding minimizes chip bleed and keeps future spots exploitable.\n\n[Fold]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \nHand range theory (in heads-up, play about 50%-60% of hands).  \nPosition matters greatly: I\u2019m in the big blind, out of position post-flop.  \nEffective stack is 990 vs 980 \u2248 49 BB.  \nPre-flop, the pot is 30 and a 20 bet is already in front of me \u2014 the decision is to call 10 more or fold.  \nHand equity: 3\u2666 7\u2660 is offsuit, one-gapped, very low\u2014its hot-cold equity is only ~34 % vs a random hand but drops quickly vs realistic defending ranges. Modern solvers suggest big-blind defend vs a 3 BB open (effectively this) requires ~55\u201360 % VPIP; this combo falls into the bottom of that range (usually >60 % defend for offsuit). 3\u2666 7\u2660 has reverse implied odds: when we hit a 7 or 3 we often get outkicked and when we make a straight it\u2019s the lower end. Our implied odds are shallow (stack \u224849 BB). Add to the out-of-position disadvantage; we risk being pushed off hands or having to play large pots without clarity.\n\nRecommendation: Fold the junk hand and look for better spots.  \n\nAction: [Fold]",
