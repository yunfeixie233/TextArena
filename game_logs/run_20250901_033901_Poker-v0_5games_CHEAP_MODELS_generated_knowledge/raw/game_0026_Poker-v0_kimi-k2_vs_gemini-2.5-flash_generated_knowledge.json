The game-theoretically correct fold against almost any bet because A) it flops nothing in its wheelhouse, B) has no straight or flush potential, and C) lacks blocker value against opponent continuing range.\n\u2022 Preflop pot odds: we already posted 10 chips out of position, so any decision must weigh that \u201csunk\u201d cost versus continuing.\n\u2022 Position vs. Initiative: we\u2019re out of position (BB) and villain has initiative. Out-of-position, reverse-implied odds increase.\n\u2022 Stack-to-pot ratio (SPR): Effective stacks 980 vs. 30 pot = ~33 SPR. We have 33 big blinds behind; chip preservation early in a 10-hand freezeout outweighs trying hero defenses with trash.\n\u2022 Long-run ICM/tournament perspective: Losing 20 chips (2 BB) is trivial; losing 990 chips is catastrophic.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge  \n1. Pre-flop strength for K-Jo (offsuit):  \n   \u2022 Against a random single opponent, K-Jo is approximately 60\u201362 % equity \u2013 clearly ahead of an average hand.  \n   \u2022 Equity drops quickly when the opponent\u2019s range contains all Broadway broadway holdings and every pocket pair. In that tighter range estimate (~top 20 % of hands), K-Jo sits at ~49 % equity\u2014essentially break-even, positional disadvantage removed.  \n   \u2022 This is a \u201cdomination-intolerant\u201d hand: you very often win small pots and lose big ones when you hit top pair second-kicker vs. better ace-King, K-Q or a set.  \n\n2. Early-Tournament 2-player dynamics:  \n   \u2022 With only 10 hands total, chip preservation matters, but winning uncontested pots is equally important because each pot represents 1.5 %\u20133 % of your chips.  \n   \u2022 With effective stack of ~970 you have ~48 BB behind ($970 / $20). That gives you room to continue post-flop without immediate stack danger even if you 3-bet and take a flop.  \n\n3. Positional & previous action:  \n   \u2022 You (P0) are SB and put 20 in already.  \n   \u2022 Your opponent (P1) is the BB; he has put only the 10-chip blind so far, so he can act last pre-flop.  \n   \u2022 Head-up ranges widen considerably: aggressive players/defending BBs stay in >90 % of hands if facing a min-raise; passive ones fold ~20\u201330 %.  \n\n4. Suggested numerical approach (Head-up from SB):  \n   \u2022 Against \u201clegit\u201d blinds, raising to 3 BB is standard (60 chips). Against loose opponents, 2.5 BB (50 chips) can suffice.  \n   \u2022 With effective-stacks >25 BB in a 2-man game you never want to limp/open-call OOP\u2014durability is won by taking initiative and forcing information.  \n\nDecision matrix  \nOption A: [Fold] \u2013 \u2013EV (-20 chips guaranteed fuell loss) unless you have perfect read that opponent will punish three-bet to shove. (Still light compared with K-Jo chance.)  \nOption B: [Call] \u2013 gaining 20 % pot odds but out of position vs whole range; rarely optimal.  \nOption C: [Raise] \u2013 exploit dominance and get value as equity better than 50 % while discouraging junk holdings. With only 20-chip bet at your feet, you need at least 50-60 chips to satisfy the minimum two-to-three BB raise and protect equity.\n\nApply Action  \n[K\u2666 J\u2665 in SB w/ 48 BB effective, facing BB only]:  \n[Call] and re-open action?

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: In a heads-up game, especially in the small blind, the range of hands to play profitably widens significantly compared to a full table. J7o is a marginal hand, generally not strong enough for raising pre-flop from the small blind against a likely tight opponent, but it's not a clear fold either, especially given the odds. The BB only needs to call 10 chips to see the flop for a pot of 40. Given the opponent's previous folds, they seem to be playing fairly tight. If they continue to fold frequently, a wider range of hands becomes profitable to steal the blinds. However, J7o has poor playability post-flop if it doesn't hit a pair or a strong draw. The cost to continue is small.\n\nDecision: Given the opponent's tendency to fold, and the small amount to call to see a flop, calling is a reasonable option to see how the opponent reacts.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nAt this stage, the pot is small relative to the stacks, and the betting has been passive (check-check on the flop). My hand is a pair of sevens (bottom pair) with a Jack kicker. The board has an Ace, which is likely hit by Player 0 given their call pre-flop. There's also a potential flush draw (two clubs on board, but I don't have a club). The 4\u2663 on the turn doesn't significantly change the board texture for my hand.\nGiven the passive play so far, checking again might be reasonable, as betting into an Ace-high board with bottom pair could be a value-bet for Player 0. However, checking leaves me vulnerable to any bet from Player 0, and my hand is unlikely to improve significantly. Betting here could be a probe bet to try and get information or a lead out.\n\nIf Player 0 has an Ace, they will likely call or raise. If they don't, they might fold or call with a worse hand (like a pair of 8s or a small pair).\n\nOptions:\n1. Check: Continue pot control, see what Player 0 does. Risk letting them see a free river or bet.\n2. Bet: Try to extract value if I believe my hand is good, or bluff. With bottom pair, it's more of a blocking bet or a bluff catcher.\n\nConsidering the small pot and the passive preceding actions, a check is usually the standard play with a weak-to-medium hand on an Ace-high board. Player 0 checked back on the flop, which could indicate weakness or a desire to pot control. If Player 0 has an Ace, they might be slow playing. If I bet and they raise, I'm likely in a difficult spot.\n\nDecision: Check, as my hand is not strong enough to confidently bet for value, and betting as a bluff might be too risky given the board texture.\n\n[Check]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\nKey poker concepts that apply here:\n\n1. Short-stack tournament play: With only 2 players and stacks this shallow (\u2248 47BB), every chip matters. Implied-odds plays (like drawing to a gutshot/flush) lose value because the upside is capped. Showdown equity is key.\n\n2. Pot-size calculation: Pot is 40 (2BB), giving both of us about 23.75:1 effective stacks. A \u201cstandard\u201d CB on this board would be ~20-24 chips (\u00bd-\u2154 pot). Yet we hold Ten-high, air equity only \u00bd pot at best because Villain declined to CB after checking flop, implying weaker range.\n\n3. Board texture: ( A\u2660-8\u2663-7\u2666-4\u2663 ). Two-tone, middle-connected but contains two overcards to our hand. Straight draws have appeared (T9- and 65-type hands got there on turn). Flush draws on clubs; we have no clubs so we block neither.\n\n4. Villain range: After P1 completes SB then checks twice, his range is capped at top-pair-weak-kicker or worse. His paired Ace combos that continue would likely have bet flop. Therefore he\u2019s mostly showing down middle pair or missed overcards.\n\n5. Range advantage vs. holding strength: Even though we have Ten-high, this board favors big blind (hero, us) because we can still have Ace-x and all straight draws that completed. His checking range has far more 9T/65 which bricked turn.\n\n6. Bet sizing: Small lead (\u00bd-\u00be pot, ~20-30 chips) on turn can often win it immediately versus the portion of Villain\u2019s range that missed (likely >50%).\n\n7. Fold equity vs. equity realization: Because stacks are short any follow-up barrel threatens >30% of villain\u2019s stack, enhancing fold equity. Conversely, checking denies us any fold equity and risks seeing a river card that may improve Villain to best hand.\n\nDecision: My open-jamming point is still 2 streets away. A profitable exploitative line is to seize the initiative and bet now.\n\nAction:\n[Bet 25]",

      "response": "Knowledge dump (tailored to heads-up, 10-hand speed format, current stack ratios)\n\n1. 10-hand match = effectively a short-stack, winner-take-all SNG. Survival > chip accumulation after hand #4.  \n   Gap Concept and \u201cNash push/fold\u201d charts are more relevant than elaborate post-flop play \u2013 effective stacks are already < 50 bb.\n\n2. Heads-up pre-flop ranges widen drastically. From SB (first to act) we should open any pair, any two Broadway, any suited cards 8x+, and most offsuit connectors down to 65o. J3o is right on the cusp; losing fold equity against competent opponent may make it unprofitable, but if villain is tight we can still steal.\n\n3. Stack leverage: SB has 970 left (48.5 bb) and BB has 1000 (50 bb). Pot is already 30 (1.5 bb). When effective stacks are this deep (relative to pot), stealing the blinds is not the only value \u2013 we can attempt small-ball 2.1\u20132.3 bb raises and often take flops or get folds.\n\n4. Villain profile so far:\n   - Folded our steals on buttons (Hands 1, 2) but only opened 62o & KJo \u2013 not stellar starting discipline.  \n   - On hand 3 in SB, villain closed the action with a weak holding (8\u2663 A\u2660 7\u2666 4\u2663) and folded to small turn barrel \u2013 shows he\u2019s not keen to float light out of position.\n\n5. Hands to continue with from SB against BB who folds to flop/turn pressure:\n   Any Broadway+'s slightly offsuit or suited connectors 65s+ are +EV to open. J3o is 48 % vs. 52 % vs. random range, but we get fold equity that turns it into a slight raise. If we were 15 bb or below we\u2019d lean shove; with 48 bb we can comfortably make a standard 2x\u20132.5x.\n\nOptions:\nA. Fold \u2013 preserve chip EV, but give up on pre-flop steal equity.  \nB. Call 20 (complete SB) \u2013 poor play; we\u2019re OOP post-flop with J3o and no initiative.  \nC. Open-raise small \u2013 2.0x to 2.5x (40\u201350). Offers fold equity, keeps pot manageable if called.  \nD. Shove \u2013 way over-committing; risk 970 for 30, inverse of good reward.\n\nBottom line: with J3o from SB facing a BB who\u2019s shown fold-to-turn-bet and middling discipline, a min-raise with eyes on taking down the pot pre-flop or with a single c-bet on safe flops is the highest EV line. Small commit, high fold equity.\n\n[Raise 40]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Hand Strength:** You have a pair of nines (99). This is a strong starting hand, especially in a 2-player game. It's a premium pair, though susceptible to overpairs (TT+, JJ+, QQ+, KK+, AA).\n2.  **Opponent's Action:** Player 0, in the Small Blind (SB) position, opened with a raise to 3x the big blind (20 and raised to 60). This indicates a relatively strong hand range from the opponent, as they are not just limping or making a minimum raise. Their range likely includes strong aces, broadway cards, and pocket pairs.\n3.  **Position:** You are on the Dealer/Big Blind (BB), meaning you have position on the opponent for subsequent streets if the hand continues. This is a significant advantage.\n4.  **Pot Odds/Stack Sizes:** The current pot is 70 (P0 bet 60, P1 bet 10). Player 0 has 930 chips remaining, and you have 1000 chips.\n5.  **Implied Odds:** With a pair, you can potentially hit a set on the flop, which significantly increases your hand's strength and value. Raising here can build a larger pot if you do hit your set, or extract value if your opponent has a weaker hand that calls.\n6.  **Strategic Options:**\n    *   **Fold:** Unthinkable with 99 against a 3x raise in a 2-player game. You have a significantly strong hand.\n    *   **Call:** Calling would mean investing 50 more chips into a pot of 70 (total 120), giving you good pot odds to see a flop. However, calling here can give information to your opponent and might encourage them to continue betting aggressively on the flop if they have an overpair or strong draw. It also doesn't extract value from weaker hands that might fold to a 3-bet.\n    *   **Re-raise (3-bet):** Raising here would put pressure on the opponent. A reasonable 3-bet size would be around 2.5x the opponent's raise, or a bit more to discourage them from continuing with weaker hands or draws. This move aims to either win the pot immediately or narrow down the opponent's range dramatically. If they call, you gain more information about the strength of their hand. If they fold, you win the pot. If they re-raise, you know they have a truly premium hand.\n7.  **Consider Player Tendencies (Limited Information):** Based on the previous hands:\n    *   Hand 1 & 2: Player 0 folded pre-flop to your blind, indicating some level of tightness or simply not having playable hands.\n    *   Hand 3: Player 0 called your SB raise, then checked the flop, then bet the turn. This shows they are willing to play hands and can be aggressive.\n\nConsidering all this, 99 is a strong enough hand to re-raise (3-bet) in this heads-up situation. It puts pressure on the opponent, builds the pot, and protects your hand against overcards hitting the flop if you just call. A common 3-bet sizing strategy is to make it around 2.5x the initial raise, plus any previous bets. Player 0 raised to 60 (from 20). You've put in 10. So P0's raise is 40 more than the effective blind. A 3-bet could be to 150-180. Let's aim for a size that's uncomfortable for marginal hands.\n\nInitial bet by P0 was a raise to 60 (meaning they put in 60 total). You need to call 50.\nA standard 3-bet would be (P0's raise) * 2.5 + your current blind.\nSo, (60 * 2.5) + 10 = 150 + 10 = 160.\nOr, make it 3x P0's raise amount if you want to be more aggressive, which is 180.\nGiven it's heads-up and you have position, an aggressive 3-bet is good.\n\nLet's make it 160. This is a raise of 150 chips (160 - 10 already put in).\nYour new bet will be 160. Player 0 has to call 100.\nThis is roughly 2.6x Player 0's raise.\n\nDecision: Re-raise to 160.\n[Raise 160]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nThis is the pre-flop in a 2-player game. I am in the Small Blind (SB) position, meaning I act first pre-flop and last post-flop. My opponent (P0) is in the Big Blind (BB) and is also the Dealer. The blinds are 10/20. I have King-Jack suited (KJs). This is a strong starting hand. In a heads-up scenario, KJs is a very playable hand, especially suited. My stack is 1050 chips, and P0 has 920 chips. I have already put in 20 chips as the SB.\n\nRelevant poker principles:\n1.  **Starting Hand Selection (Heads-up):** In heads-up play, starting hand requirements are much looser than in a full ring game. KJs is a premium hand in heads-up, offering both high card strength and flush potential.\n2.  **Position:** Being in the SB pre-flop means I act first. This is generally a disadvantage post-flop, but it gives me the opportunity to raise and try to take control of the hand.\n3.  **Aggression:** Heads-up play favors aggression. Raising pre-flop can help define the strength of my hand and potentially win the pot outright or gain control of the pot.\n4.  **Stack Sizes:** My opponent has a slightly smaller stack (920 vs my 1050). This isn't a huge difference, but I should be aware of it for potential all-in situations later.\n5.  **Pot Odds / Implied Odds (not immediately relevant but good to keep in mind):** When playing drawing hands, flush/straight potential means higher implied odds if I connect.\n6.  **Hand History:** P0 has folded frequently earlier. This suggests they might be playing somewhat tight. A raise here could be effective.\n\nEvaluation of Options:\n*   **Fold:** Folding KJs in the SB heads-up is too weak. It's a strong hand with good potential.\n*   **Call (Limp):** Calling the 10-chip bet to complete the big blind (total 20 chips) is called limping. While sometimes acceptable with speculative hands, limping with a strong hand like KJs is generally discouraged as it sacrifices the opportunity to win the pot pre-flop and gives P0 a free card. It also makes it harder to define my hand strength.\n*   **Raise:** This is the most appropriate action. A raise achieves several goals:\n    *   It puts pressure on P0, who will have to defend their big blind.\n    *   It allows me to take control of the hand (initiative).\n    *   It builds a larger pot when I have a strong hand.\n    *   It gives me a chance to win the pot pre-flop if P0 folds.\n    *   It charges weaker hands to see the flop.\n\nA standard pre-flop raise in heads-up play is often 2.5x to 3x the big blind, or slightly more depending on the table dynamics. Here, P0 already has 10 chips in, so the bet to call is 10. The current bet shown is 20 (BB). I've put in 20. The pot is 30.\nI need to raise by *N* chips *on top of* the current bet of 20 (which is from my SB). The actual bet to face is 10 from P0, if I want to just call.\nNo, the bet is 20 for me, as the SB. P0 has put in 10 chips. Current bet in the center is 20.\nAh, P1 (me) is SB and has bet 20. P0 (Dealer/BB) has bet 10. The current bet is 20 (my blind). So P0 needs to call my SB of 20, or raise. P0 called 10 (which is the SB amount). No, wait. P0 (dealer/BB) has bet 10. P1 (SB) has bet 20. The *current bet* that I am facing is P0's contribution of 10. If I am the SB, I have already put in 20. P0 is the BB, and has put in 10. This is confusing.\n\nLet's re-read the state carefully:\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 920.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1050.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\n\nThis means I am the SB and my 20 chips are the \"current bet\" in terms of how much P0 needs to call.\nP0 is BB and has posted 10 chips. So P0 owes 10 more chips to call my SB. This seems backward from standard poker order (SB posts small, BB posts large).\nHowever, \"Current bet\" is stated as 20, and I (P1) have bet 20. P0 has bet 10.\nThis implies P0 (BB) needs to call 10 (to match my 20).\nIn this specific game format, the \"Current bet\" refers to the highest individual bet on the table.\nSo, P0 (BB) has committed 10. I (SB) have committed 20. P0 still owes 10 to match my bet of 20.\n\nGiven this, I have already posted my SB. P0 (BB) has posted 10. P0 needs to call another 10 to match my blind. I am the first to act pre-flop. My options are:\n1.  **Fold:** Too weak for KJs.\n2.  **Call:** This means calling the 10-chip difference from P0's 10-chip post to match my 20-chip post, making the action on P0. This is still limping from the SB, which is not ideal with a strong hand.\n3.  **Raise:** I want to raise. A typical raise would be to 3x the BB, or 60. Since I already have 20 in, I would raise by an additional 40 chips, making my total bet 60.\n\nLet's stick to the interpretation that P1 is SB with 20 chips in, P0 is BB with 10 chips in, and P0 needs to call 10 more to match my 20. I am first to act.\nA standard raise would be to 60 (3xBB). Since I already have 20 in, I need to raise by 40 chips. My total bet would be 60.\nLet's make it a substantial raise to put pressure. I will raise to 60 Total. Since I already have 20 in, I need to raise by 40.\n\nDecision: Raise to 60.\n\n'[Raise 40]'",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nIn a heads-up game the wide-range dynamics are key.  \n- Position matters enormously: when you\u2019re out of position (BB vs SB) you must proceed more cautiously.  \n- Equity of 8\u266510\u2660 heads-up is decent: ~50 % vs a random hand, ~46 % vs a typical SB open-raise range (any pair, any 2 broadways, any ace, suited connectors, suited one-gappers).  \n- Pot odds: we have to call 50 into a pot of 70. We need 50 / (70 + 50) \u2248 41.7 % equity to break even.  \n- Stack depth: effective stacks after a call would be 860 behind into a 120 pot\u2014plenty of post-flop playability, and suited T8 realises equity better than raw pre-flop equity suggests by making straights and back-door flush draws.  \n- Opponent pattern so far: P1 over-valued J3 earlier (3-bet off 220 chips) and hasn\u2019t shown a tight range, so his 3 BB open is likely wide.  \n- Tournament life: still 6 hands after this\u2014only a modest chip deficit (~130)\u2014no need to gamble big, but can\u2019t be purely risk-averse either.\n\nEvaluation:\n- Raw pot odds (+P1\u2019s loose image) give us enough equity.  \n- We act last pre-flop (in the BB), but will act out of position post-flop; therefore simply calling keeps the pot manageable and disguises our hand. Folding forfeits > 4bb of value (vs SB open size), while 3-bet will bloated stacks OOP with a hand that is still behind P1\u2019s value raises.\n\nDecision:\n[Call]",

There's a flush draw immediately available (any diamond completes it), and also straight opportunities (e.g., 5-6, 6-8, 9-T, T-J, J-K, K-A all have open-ended straight draws or gutshots).\nMy hand is K\u2660, J\u2660. This is a completely air hand on this board. I have no pair, no flush draw, and no straight draw. My hand is currently worthless.\nMy opponent made a flop bet. This could indicate a made hand (a pair, two pair, set), or a strong draw (flush or straight). Given the board, a flush draw is highly likely if they are betting.\nI checked, indicating weakness. My opponent then bet into my check. This is often a sign of strength or a confident bet to take down the pot.\nThe pot is currently 180 chips. Player 0 bet 60 chips, which is 1/3 of the pot. This is a common bet size.\nConsidering my hand, I have no equity. Continuing in this hand would be purely a bluff or a very thin prayer. It's a bad spot to bluff since my opponent showed strength by betting into me on a super wet board.\n\nApplying Knowledge:\nMy hand has no value and no immediate draws. The board is very dangerous, and any diamond or certain straight cards would significantly improve an opponent's hand if they have a draw. Player 0's bet indicates strength on a board that I cannot connect with. Folding is the correct play here to avoid throwing more chips into a lost cause.\n\nDecision:\n[Fold]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nMy hand (K\u2663, 8\u2666) is a mediocre, unsuited king. In a heads-up scenario, this is slightly better than general 6-max play, but still on the weaker side for raising the big blind, especially being out of position (SB). The opponent has called a raise from me in a previous hand (Hand 5) with what seems to be a reasonable hand, and also raised my big blind in Hand 4 with an implied strong hand (leading to my 99 raise). However, in this specific hand, they are in the big blind and have the option to call my raise or fold. Their range is wider here.\n\nGiven I am the SB, I am opening the action. My options are to fold, complete the small blind (call 10 chips to meet the big blind), or raise.\n\nFolding is generally not advisable in the small blind heads-up as you've already committed chips and have a chance to see the flop or pick up the pot.\nCalling to see a flop with K8o is an option, but puts me out of position for the rest of the hand, which is a significant disadvantage.\nRaising is a strong play, but with K8o, it's a marginal raise for value. However, it can put pressure on the opponent. A standard raise would be to 2.5x or 3x the big blind, so 50-60 chips. This is also a good opportunity for a steal if the opponent is likely to fold.\n\nConsidering the opponent's previous actions:\n- Hand 3: Called my SB open with a hand that hit a 7 on the flop, then bet turn when I checked. Suggests a willingness to play post-flop, even from BB.\n- Hand 4: Raised my BB (from SB) strongly with PPs (99), indicating they will play strong hands aggressively.\n- Hand 5: Called my SB raise with what seemed like a drawing hand (or at least no obvious pair) and then caught a flush draw on the flop and bet into me. This suggests they are willing to play drawing hands.\n\nGiven the opponent's willingness to call and play post-flop, raising with K8o out of position is risky. A call might induce a check back on the flop and allow me to see more cards cheaply, but I'll still be out of position. I've been opening a fair amount, so a raise here with a marginal hand risks being called by a better hand, or being re-raised.\n\nMy default strategy in these heads-up small blind situations should be to either raise with a decent range or complete. With K8o, completion is fine to see a flop cheaply, especially if I can anticipate checking to the opponent.\n\nDecision: I will complete the small blind (call 10 chips), hoping to hit something on the flop and keep the pot small while out of position.\n[Call]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Stack-to-Pot Ratio (SPR)**: With 960 chips and a pot of 30, the SPR is ~32. This is a deep-stack situation, allowing for more post-flop play and less commitment with marginal hands.\n\n2. **Hand Strength**: 6\u2660 3\u2665 is a very weak offsuit hand with no connectivity, no flush potential, and low card values. It ranks in the bottom 15% of starting hands.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm in the Big Blind (out of position) against the Small Blind. This is disadvantageous as I'll act first post-flop.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: \n   - P1 has been aggressive pre-flop (raising 60 in Hand 5, 3-betting to 220 in Hand 4)\n   - P1 has folded to flop bets twice (Hands 3 and 5) when facing aggression\n\n5. **Tournament Dynamics**: \n   - 4 hands played, 6 remaining\n   - I'm slightly behind (960 vs 1010)\n   - No immediate pressure from blinds (they're fixed at 10/20)\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: Facing 10 more to call into a 30 pot (3:1 odds), but this is irrelevant with such a weak hand.\n\n7. **ICM Considerations**: In a 2-player tournament, chip EV \u2248 $ EV, so we can play purely for chip accumulation.\n\nDecision: This hand is far too weak to play out of position, especially against an aggressive opponent. The 6\u2660 3\u2665 has poor equity realization and will be difficult to play profitably post-flop.\n\n[Fold]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nIn a heads-up game, position (being the dealer/BB in this case) is a significant advantage as you act last on all post-flop streets, giving you more information. However, in this pre-flop scenario, I am in the Small Blind and Player 0 is the Dealer/Big Blind. This means I act first pre-flop and then first on all subsequent streets.\n\nMy hand J\u2665, 4\u2665 is a relatively weak suited connector. It's a speculative hand that can make straights or flushes, but the high card strength is low. Against a single opponent, suited hands can have some playability.\n\nGiven Player 0's folding tendencies (they have folded 5 out of 8 hands so far, often to a raise), stealing the blinds is a viable strategy, especially with the game nearing its end (Hand 9 of 10). A standard raise size would be 2.5x to 3x the big blind. Since I am already in for 20 chips, a raise to 60 (3 BBs) implies an additional 40 chips. This is a small investment for the chance to win the current 30 chip pot.\n\nHowever, if Player 0 calls or raises, my hand is likely to be dominated. Playing out of position with a weak speculative hand is generally not recommended. The decision here balances blind stealing strategy with hand strength and positional disadvantage. Since Player 0 has been folding frequently, a raise is often profitable.\n\nEvaluate Options:\n1.  **[Fold]**: This guarantees a loss of 20 chips. While safe, it misses an opportunity to win 30 chips against an opponent prone to folding. Given the remaining hands, every chip gained or lost matters.\n2.  **[Call 10]**: This would complete the big blind, making the pot 40 chips. This is a passive play that would lead to a flop out of position with a weak hand. It's generally not good.\n3.  **[Raise N]**: Raising puts pressure on Player 0 to fold. A raise size of 60 (3 BBs) or 70 (3.5 BBs) would be typical. If they fold, I win the 30 chips. If they call, I am playing out of position with a weak hand, which is undesirable. If they re-raise, I will likely have to fold. However, the frequent folding of Player 0 makes this a profitable long-term play, even with a weak hand.\n\nDecision:\nGiven Player 0's tendency to fold pre-flop and the game being heads-up, a raise to steal the blinds is a good strategy here, despite the weak hand. I will raise to 60.\n\n[Raise 60]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1.  **Stack-to-Pot Ratio (SPR) & Tournament Stage:** The game is a short 10-hand tournament, so ICM pressure isn't as severe as an MTT final table, but stack preservation is still key. With blinds of 10/20 and effective stacks of 940 and 1030, the effective stack is 47 big blinds. This is a medium SPR, allowing for post-flop play.\n\n2.  **Positional Importance & Blind Structure:** You are the SB for the last hand. This is the worst position pre-flop, as you have no information on your opponent's intentions yet. However, post-flop, SB acts first on the flop. The pot is 30 pre-flop due to the blinds, and it's your turn to act after Villain (BB) has posted their big blind.\n\n3.  **Pre-flop Hand Value & Ranges:**\n    *   **Villain's Range:** Villain is the BB. From this position, facing no prior action, their standard defense range against a SB open is relatively wide (including broadway, suited connectors, pairs, and some stronger Ax, Kx, Qx/Jx hands). However, in a 2-player game, this range can be adjusted based on your observed pattern.\n    *   **Hero's Hand:** You hold A\u26667\u2666. This is a strong Ace-high hand, especially suited. It's a clear open from any position in late stages of a tournament, and certainly here. It has good playability post-flop: top-pair potential, nut flush draw potential.\n\n4.  **Opponent's Observed Tendencies (Over 9 hands):** Your opponent has been quite aggressive pre-flop but not overly bluff-y post-flop. They raised to 60 from the SB in Hand 5 when you were the BB (a 3x open). In Hand 4, as the BB, they 4-bet to 220 over your 3x open (60 from 970 stack) with what was likely a strong hand. They have folded to continuation bets (checking flop in Hand 3, folding to your 60 into 120 pot in Hand 5).\n\n5.  **Projected Strategy:**\n    *   **Pre-flop:** You need to open aggressively here. A\u26667\u2666 is a strong hand in this spot. A standard open from the SB, where you already have 2 dead chips in, is typically 2.5-3x the big blind (so 40-60). Given it's the final hand and a decent hand, a strong opening is warranted.\n    *   **Post-flop:** Assuming you raise, Villain might call or re-raise. Given their pre-flop aggression earlier, a 3-bet is possible. However, a flat call (defend) is also probable. Post-flop, you'll have position if you raise to 30 (effectively closing the action pre-flop), but if villain 3-bets, you'll be facing a decision. A\u26667\u2666 isn't vulnerable to the A on the flop.\n\nDecision: This is a clear open. A standard raise to 2.5x \u2013 3x the BB is 50-60 chips. A pot-sized raise is 50 (20 + 10 + 30 = 60 - 30 = 30, effectively). A 2.5x from SB has you investing 30 more chips (from 20 to 30). Let's raise to **60** chips (2x the villain's BB).",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\nKey principles for this spot:\n\n1. Hand strength: A\u2666 7\u2666 is a strong heads-up hand, well above average in a 2-player game.  \n2. Position: I\u2019m in the SB (out of position). Heads-up the SB acts first pre-flop, which is a disadvantage.  \n3. Stack depth: 940 chips vs P1\u2019s 1030, blinds 10/20, so ~47 BB effective\u2014medium stacks, still plenty of play.  \n4. Optimal heads-up open: With 20 already posted, the pot is 30 and it\u2019s 10 more to me. A\u2666 7\u2666 is an easy raise for value and to build the pot; limping or folding would both be large mistakes.  \n5. Sizing: Standard heads-up raise from SB is 2.5\u20133 BB. 3 BB = 60 chips total (raise by 40 over the 20 already posted). That keeps fold equity high and builds pot while leaving maneuverability post-flop.  \n6. Opponent tendencies: P1 has been active; they 3-bet me once already (Hand 4) and folded to flop bets twice. They respect aggression, so raising should often take it down immediately or give us the lead post-flop.\n\nDecision: Raise to the standard 3 BB.\n\n[Raise 60]",
