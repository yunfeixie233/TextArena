      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n- Hand strength: J\u2660 7\u2660 is a marginal, offsuit hand with limited playability.  It flops top-pair ~6% of the time, a flush-draw ~6.5%, and a straight-draw ~9%.  Equity versus a random hand is \u2248 53 %, but versus a typical 2-player SB opening range (top 35 %) it falls to \u2248 37 %.  \n- Position: I\u2019m the Big Blind out-of-position post-flop, which magnifies the disadvantage of a marginal hand.  \n- Pot odds: I\u2019ve already posted the big blind (10).  To see the flop I must call 10 more into a pot that will be 40.  Pot odds = 10 / 40 = 25 %.  My equity (~37 %) comfortably exceeds the required 25 %, so a call is mathematically justified if SB\u2019s range is reasonably wide.  \n- Stack depth: Effective stacks are 980 chips, so we are 49 BB deep\u2014ample room to maneuver post-flop.  This favors realizing equity rather than pushing fold equity pre-flop.  \n- Opponent tendencies: No reads yet, but in heads-up play the small blind should open a wide range.  The fact that SB only limped (completed) rather than raising could indicate weakness or a trapping line.  \n- Future streets: Out-of-position play means we\u2019ll often face difficult decisions on later streets.  However, the price is small relative to stack depth, and we have a suited Jack with back-door straight possibilities.  \n- ICM / tournament considerations: Early in a 10-hand match, chip preservation is not critical; accumulating chips is more valuable.  Folding here saves 10 chips but forgoes a +EV opportunity.\n\nDecision:\nWe have the correct pot odds, reasonable equity, and enough stack depth to realize it.  Folding forfeits too much value.  Raising is unnecessary with a marginal hand out of position.\n\n[Call]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nThe board is 10-3-5 with two clubs and one diamond, meaning no flushes are possible yet. My pocket pair of 2s is the lowest possible pair. This board is very dry and doesn't connect well with many hands, but an overpair to the board (Tens or higher) is possible, as are sets of 3s, 5s, or 10s. Two pair or straight draws (4-6) are less likely. My hand has very little equity against most likely opponent holding. Early in a tournament, chip preservation is important. Out of position, it's generally better to play tight. With a small pair like 2s, I need to hit a set to have strong equity. On this flop, I have not hit a set. My odds of hitting a set on the flop were approximately 11.8%. Since I did not, my hand is currently very weak. My opponent is on the button and is the big blind, meaning they will act last on all remaining streets. This position advantage makes it harder for me to bluff or control the pot size.\n\nGiven the dry board and my very weak hand (underpair), playing cautiously is the best approach. There's no reason to build a large pot with such a vulnerable hand. If my opponent bets, calling would be burning chips, and raising would be a hopeful bluff with very poor equity.\n\nDecision:\n[Check]",

It fares poorly out-of-position (OOP).  \n2. Position Dynamics  \n   - Small-blind = First-to-act on every post-flop street = information disadvantage.  \n   - Our range in heads-up SB should be tighter (\u2248 45 %) and aggression-weighted toward the BB\u2019s weaker ranges.  \n3. Stack-to-Pot Ratio (SPR)  \n   Effective stacks of 1 000 / 30 \u2248 33.3 post-flop\u2014deep enough to maneuver on turn/river, encouraging flop attack with stronger range rather than bloating the pot now with marginal holdings.  \n4.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nMy current hand is J\u2663 7\u2663. This is an unsuited middle-card hand. In early positions (which SB is relative to BB), these hands generally have low equity and are often best folded unless there's a strong reason to play. Given the pre-flop action, Player 0 (BB) called the small blind of 10 chips, and I (SB) posted 20 chips. Player 0 has already contributed 10 chips to the pot and would need to call an additional 10 chips to see a flop.\n\nHowever, Player 0 is also the Dealer/BB, which gives them positional advantage post-flop. My hand, J\u2663 7\u2663, is a marginal speculative hand at best. It's too weak to open for a raise, and calling would put me out of position with a hand that struggles to make strong pairs or draws. Given that it's early in the tournament and stacks are deep, playing marginal hands out of position is generally unprofitable. Player 0 has merely called the small blind, not raised, which suggests they might have a wider range of hands, but my hand doesn't warrant a call.

In flop games being OOP favors a larger 3-bet rather than small because it cuts positional advantage, reduces villain\u2019s implied odds, and lets us comfortably continue on later streets.  \n- Heads-up tempo: In short 10-hand matches aggression early sets psychological tone.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nMy current hand, 10\u2663 5\u2663, is a mediocre speculative hand. It has suited connectors potential but significantly gaped. It's not a strong hand to call a raise with, especially out of position (Big Blind) against an aggressive opponent who just raised 3x the big blind.\n\nRelevant poker principles:\n1.  **Position is power:** I am out of position in the Big Blind, meaning I have to act first on all subsequent streets (flop, turn, river). This is a significant disadvantage, as I lack information about my opponent's actions before making my own.\n2.  **Hand Strength vs. Raise Size:** My hand is weak. Player 0 opened to 60 chips, a 3x raise of the big blind. This indicates some strength from Player 0. Calling with a weak hand out of position often leads to difficult decisions on later streets and can bleed chips.\n3.  **Pot Odds:** To call, I would need to put in 50 chips to win a pot of 70 + 50 (my call) = 120 chips if everyone folded. That's 50/120, or roughly 2.4:1 pot odds. While these odds might seem okay for a speculative hand if I had position, they are not good enough for such a weak hand out of position, especially when considering implied odds are low with this specific hand against a likely better hand.\n4.  **Implied Odds:** With 10\u2663 5\u2663, my implied odds are not great. It's difficult to make a strong hand that gets paid off without also putting the opponent on a very specific range. If I hit a flush, it might be a low flush. If I hit two pair or trips, I might be outkicked or facing a better hand.\n5.  **Reverse Implied Odds:** Weak hands that can make second-best hands often have reverse implied odds. This means when I hit something, it might still lose to a better hand, leading me to put more money into a losing pot.\n6.  **Tight-Aggressive (TAG) Strategy:** In general, it's good to play tighter from out of position and to avoid calling raises with marginal hands. This pre-flop raise suggests Player 0 is playing somewhat aggressively. It's better to preserve chips for stronger hands or better opportunities.\n\nEvaluation:\n-   My hand (10\u2663 5\u2663) is weak and speculative.\n-   I am out of position.\n-   Player 0's raise to 60 is a significant raise (3x BB).\n-   Calling would put me in a difficult spot on the flop, likely facing a continuation bet with no clear path to winning unless I hit very strongly.\n-   Folding preserves my chip stack and avoids difficult future decisions with a weak hand.\n\nDecision: Folding is the most prudent play here to avoid committing more chips to a hand with poor equity and position.\n\n[Fold]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Starting Hand Strength:** My hand 4d, 7d is a marginal speculative hand. It has suited connectors potential (straight and flush draw), but it's not a strong pre-flop hand, especially unraised. With a raise or a poor position, it's often a fold.\n2.  **Position:** I am in the Small Blind (SB). This is a disadvantageous position as I will act first post-flop for the rest of the hand. This limits my ability to see opponent's actions before making my own.\n3.  **Opponent's Tendencies (Limited Data):** So far, Player 0 has been relatively aggressive pre-flop, raising in Hand 4 and folding to my blinds in Hands 2 and 6. This suggests they might be stealing blinds or willing to apply pressure.\n4.  **Optimal Strategy for Weak Hands in SB:** When in the SB with a weak or marginal hand, and facing an unraised pot (Player 0 is the Dealer/BB), a fold is often the correct play to avoid being out of position post-flop with a weak hand. Calling 10 chips to see a flop is cheap, but it often leads to losing more chips later if I don't hit something strong.\n5.  **Chip Stacks:** My stack is 950, Player 0's is 1020. Stacks are similar, so no immediate pressure of being short-stacked.\n\nEvaluation of Options:\n*   **[Fold]:** This is a strong option. I avoid playing out of position with a marginal hand and save 20 chips. Given the unraised pot, I only lose my 20 chips blind. If I call and don't hit well on the flop, I'll likely have to fold anyway.\n*   **[Call 10]:** This would make the pot 40 and cost me 10 more chips. While cheap, playing suited connectors out of position against potentially aggressive play from Player 0 is risky. I'd need to hit something strong (two pair, trips, flush draw, straight draw) to continue. Without hitting, I'm just burning chips.\n*   **[Bet N] (Raise):** This is not a good option with 4d, 7d in the SB against the BB. It's a weak hand to bluff with, and if called, I'd be out of position with a weak speculative hand in a raised pot.\n\nDecision:\nGiven my marginal hand, disadvantageous position, and the risks of playing out of position in a multi-street game, folding is the most prudent decision to preserve chips for stronger hands or better positions.\n[Fold]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge  \n- Preflop ranges in heads-up: J9o is comfortably ahead of the Big Blind\u2019s range (60 % equity against a random hand).  \n- Small Blind (Hero) is out of position; opening too tight here leaks blinds, but limping invites BB to see flops cheaply.  \n- Chip dynamics: Hero (1030) vs Villain (940) is essentially even; small edges compound fast in a 10-hand match.  \n- Exploit adjustment: Villain has folded to every open so far except Hand-1 (tiny pot). Continuation frequency vs aggression seems very low.  \n- Default SB pre-flop baseline \u2248 raise to 2-2.5 bb; with blinds 10/20, 60 (3 bb) is standard and has yielded folds four of the five times tried.  \n- Fold equity is valuable because Villain rarely defends; passive table \u2192 raise a wide steal range (50 % or more) from SB.\n\nEvaluate & Act  \nJ\u2665 9\u2666 rates as a medium-open that profits from fold equity against a foldy opponent. A 3 bb raise should take the pot >70 % of the time right now, and when villain calls we still have 25 % equity even vs top-tier defending range. Limping lets Villain realize equity cheaply; folding surrenders 1.5 bb when raising is clearly +EV.\n\n[BT PSEUDO] Bet 60",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. Heads-up dynamics \u2013 In 2-player (heads-up) poker, hand strength requirements are far lower than at full tables. Any Broadway or suited/connected hand has significant play-making value, and aggression is generally rewarded versus tight, fold-happy opponents.\n\n2. Opening range & position \u2013 When in the Small Blind (SB) you are out of position for every post-flop street; nevertheless, you act first pre-flop. Opening ranges from the SB should therefore still be very wide, but calling from the SB out of position is risky. A better default is either a fold or a raise, sizing up to 3BB (here, 60-chip raise to 80 total) when you expect folds often or have a hand with decent equity potential.\n\n3. Opponent pattern \u2013 After 7 rounds, P1 has:\n   \u2022 folded pre-flop five times in a row (Hands 2, 3, 5, 7 \u2013 folding after you raised only in Hand 4, and folding to 20 blind in Hands 3, 5, 7), \n   \u2022 only once taking the free flop when you limped as BB (Hand 1) and checked down to the river.\n   \u21d2 P1 appears tight-passive / risk-averse. This invites frequent steal attempts from SB as long as stacks are healthy (still 1030 vs 940).\n\n4. Rank & playability of J\u2665 9\u2666 \u2013 Unsuited, one-gap Broadway hand. Equity-wise it is far above the bottom 50% of hands, and with P1 folding excessively, it\u2019s strong enough to raise as a steal. Hand has overs to many flops and can flop straights (T-8-x) or top-pair J. Because it has mediocre showdown value multi-street, the ideal route is pre-flop aggression to take it down without seeing a flop.\n\n5. Tactical sizing \u2013 In this blind structure (10/20), a 3x raise out of SB is standard. That means raise to 60 (20 + 40 more). It risks 40 rolling off an effective 1030 stack (~3.9% risk) while often winning the 30-chip pot immediately (~1330%/year EV) against the observed fold frequency.\n\nDecision:\n\n[Raise 60]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nMy current hand is 6\u2663, 7\u2660. This is a low-to-mid value suited connector. While it has some potential for straights or flushes, it is a speculative hand, especially when facing a pre-flop raise.\n\nP0 (SB) raised to 80 chips. I am currently on the Dealer/BB, having posted 10 chips. To call, I need to put in an additional 70 chips (80 - 10). The pot is currently 90 chips (80 from P0, 10 from me). If I call, the pot will be 160 chips.\n\nKey considerations:\n1.  **Hand Strength:** 6\u2663 7\u2660 is a marginal starting hand for calling a significant pre-flop raise (4x the big blind). It's behind most hands that would open raise to 4BB.\n2.  **Position:** I am in the Big Blind, which means I have relative position post-flop if I call and P0 checks. However, P0 is the Small Blind and will act before me on future streets if I check.\n3.  **Opponent Tendency:** P0 has fold 3 out of 4 times they were the SB when not raising and won 3 pots by other players folding. This indicates P0 might be aggressive with good hands but also willing to fold marginal ones. Their previous raise in Hand 4 was also sizable (60 chips on a 20 BB, 3BB open). This current raise is 4BB.\n4.  **Implied Odds:** If I hit a strong hand (flush, straight, two pair), I could potentially win a large pot. However, the probability of hitting a strong hand with this specific connector is not high enough to justify calling such a large raise with negative immediate odds (investing 70 to win 90 is not great, but this is preflop).\n5.  **Chip Stack:** My stack is 940, P0's is 970. We are relatively even. I don't want to bleed chips with speculative hands.\n6.  **Game State:** It's early in a 10-hand game. Preserving chips is important.\n\nEvaluation of Options:\n*   **[Fold]:** This is the most conservative play. My hand is weak against a likely strong range P0 is representing with this raise. Folding preserves my chips for better spots.\n*   **[Call]:** Calling requires 70 more chips. My hand is statistically unlikely to be ahead pre-flop, and I'd be playing out of position post-flop. While it has some backdoor potential, the risk reward for calling with 67s against a 4BB raise is not favorable. The pot odds wouldn't be strong enough for a speculative hand like this.\n*   **[Raise N]:** Raising (re-raising) with 6\u2663 7\u2660 would be a major bluff and highly risky. I don't have enough information about P0's tendencies to execute a successful re-raise bluff, and my hand is not strong enough for value.\n\nConclusion: Given the weak hand, the size of P0's raise (representing strength), and the desire to preserve chips in an early stage of the game, folding is the most prudent decision.\n[Fold]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n*   **Pre-flop Strategy (General):** In a heads-up game, especially in the Small Blind position, we should widen our opening range compared to a full ring game. However, 8s Ks is a mediocre hand. It's suited, which adds a little value for flush potential, and has a strong King. But the 8 is a disconnected card, reducing straights.\n*   **Small Blind vs. Big Blind:** The Small Blind in pre-flop is typically at a positional disadvantage post-flop against the Big Blind. This means we prefer to play premium hands or hands with good post-flop playability. When facing a raise, this disadvantage is amplified.\n*   **Hand Strength (8s Ks):** This hand is speculative. It has potential for a strong flush or top pair, but is vulnerable if it misses. Against an unknown opponent's typical raise size from the Big Blind, we need to consider pot odds and implied odds.\n*   **Opponent Tendencies:** So far, Player 0 has been relatively aggressive in pre-flop, raising in multiple hands, or just folding when we were the Big Blind. They won hand 1 (flop to river) with J7 offsuit, indicating they might play a wide range or be willing to bluff. Their recent raises (H4, H8) suggest they are not just passively folding.\n*   **Pot Odds:** We have already put in 20 chips as the Small Blind. To call, we would need to match the current bet of 20 chips, making the pot 50 chips (our 20 + their 10 + 20 from our call). We would be risking 20 to win 50, which is 2.5:1 pot odds. This is irrelevant right now as there's no bet to call from P0.\n*   **Current Situation:** We are the Small Blind, and it's our turn to act. The Big Blind (P0) has posted 10 chips, and we've posted 20. There is no raise yet, only the blinds.\n\nApplying Knowledge:\n\nSince Player 0 is the Big Blind and it's their turn after us, they are in a favorable position (last to act post-flop). Our hand (8s Ks) is fair for heads-up, especially suited, but not a powerhouse. We need to decide whether to open (raise) or just call (limp). Limping with a hand like 8s Ks can be problematic as it invites Player 0 to see a cheap flop, and then we're out of position. Raising for value or to steal the blinds is usually a better strategy. Given that Player 0 has been fairly active, a raise could either win the pot immediately or give us control of the hand if they call. A standard open raise from the SB is typically 2-3x the BB. Given the blinds are 10/20, a raise to 60 would be a 3x raise. This tests P0 and gives us a chance to win the blinds or play for a larger pot with a somewhat decent hand.\n\nDecision: Raise to 60.\n\n[Raise 60]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nThis is a pre-flop situation in a 2-player game. Player 0 (BB) has re-raised my opening raise significantly (3-betting to 240 chips from my 80 chip raise, after they posted 10 and I posted 20).\nMy hand: K\u2660 8\u2660 (King-Eight suited) - This is a decent, but not premium hand. It has good high-card potential and flush potential. Against a strong 3-bet, it's marginal.\nPlayer 0's stack: 820 chips. My stack: 860 chips. Both players have relatively deep stacks.\nPot: 320 chips. Current bet for me to call: 240 chips (-80 chips I already put in) = 160 chips.\nPot odds for calling: If I call, the pot will be 320 (current) + 160 (my call) + 160 (P0's potential bet if I raise) = 640 chips. No, if I call, the pot total is 320 (already there) + 160 (my call) = 480 chips. My cost to call is 160 chips. So 480/160 = 3:1 pot odds. This is a decent price, but the implied odds are highly relevant given the pre-flop action.\n\nMy options:\n1.  **Fold**: Concede the pot of 80 chips. This is the most conservative option and saves chips against what appears to be a strong hand from Player 0.\n2.  **Call 160**: See a flop. This commits a significant portion of my stack (80+160 = 240 chips) with a hand that is vulnerable to overpairs or stronger Kx hands. If I miss the flop, I'll be in a tough spot with a large pot. If a King or a spade comes, I might be in good shape, but Player 0's 3-bet suggests strength.\n3.  **Re-raise (4-bet)**: This would be a massive commitment and is likely only appropriate with premium hands (AA, KK, QQ, AK). With K8s, it's a huge bluff, risking a large portion of my stack with relatively low equity against a likely strong range. Given Stack-to-Pot Ratio (SPR) will be low if I call, going all-in now could be a consideration, but my hand is not strong enough for that.\n\nPlayer 0's 3-bet from the Big Blind after my Small Blind raise (which is seen as a weak raise by many players if not for value) suggests a strong hand or a very aggressive player. Given the previous hands where P0 has been aggressive pre-flop, they might be leaning on the aggressive side. However, a 3-bet of this size (3x my raise, 12x BB) is usually for value.\n\nConsidering my hand, K\u2660 8\u2660, it's a good suited connector, but it's not a premium hand. Facing a strong 3-bet, it's likely dominated by hands like AK, KQ, stronger pocket pairs. While it has flush potential, the immediate pot odds are not good enough to justify calling with marginal equity against a strongly weighted range. Folding preserves my stack. Calling risks a large chunk with a hand that flops well only a third of the time. Raising is out of the question with K8s.\n\nEvaluating the game state:\n-   It's a 2-player game, so ranges are wider, but strong action still means strong hands.\n-   Player 0 has been slightly more aggressive in previous hands.\n-   My stack is 860, P0's is 820. We're both deep.\n-   This is hand 9 of 10, so it's getting late in the game. Chip preservation is important, but so is seizing opportunities. This doesn't feel like an opportunity.\n\nDecision: My hand is not strong enough to call such a large 3-bet. I'm likely dominated. Folding is the disciplined play here to preserve chips for a better spot.\n\n[Fold]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge (Hand 10 / 10 \u2013 Pre-flop, 30-stack blinds 10/20):\n\n1. Pre-flop equity math  \n   - 10\u2660 5\u2666 offsuit is in the bottom 35 % or so of starting hands in heads-up play, far behind top 15 % ranges.  \n   - Versus any two cards the equity sits around 42 %; versus a reasonable villain 30-35 % range it shrinks to \u2248 35 %.  \n\n2. Tournament-level stack considerations  \n   - Effective stack: P1 (BB) has 850; our 1,120 gives us 42 big blinds effective.  \n   - With only one hand remaining, chip-leverage decisions are determined almost entirely by showdown value and stack-pressure dynamics, not long-term survival.  \n\n3. Position & betting history  \n   - We are Small Blind (out of position) this hand.  \n   - P1 has rarely shown aggression; largest pre-flop 3-bet was 80 (hand 9) and he folded to a re-raise. Mad raise/fold pattern suggests he\u2019ll defend wide but 3-bet/fold to pressure, giving our late pressure a high fold-equity ceiling.  \n\n4. Blockers & board coverage  \n   - T5 offsuit blocks some of his broadway stealer combos (T alone is only moderate). Combo lacks straight/flush coordination, so when called we\u2019ll be flipping at best.  \n\n5. Pure EV perspective for heads-up final hand  \n   - Because blinds will increase after this, additional small-blind chips are practically immaterial; we care primarily about chip count at exit. If we fold now, we end with 1,100; a steal adds \u2248 30 with modest risk.  \n   - Fold equity: versus wide BB defend (call 55 %\u201360 %), raise/fold frequency effectively needs ~65 % fold to yield > 0 chip EV for risk of 20. Opponent\u2019s pattern implies lower call-pair > 55 %, so steal is +EV.  \n\n6. Psychological exploit  \n   - P1 just suffered two three-bet folds (hands 8\u20139), is likely tilted or shell-shocked, widening his bluff-catch SB defend calls. Conversely, he may tilt fold even wider.  \n\nEvaluation  \nCalling min-raise OOP with T5o has reverse pot-odds; we only have ~35 % equity. The hand is easy fold or easy steal spot. Given the moderate stack, small risk, and evidence of P1\u2019s fold tendencies, pushing him off dominated wide ranges is more profitable than flat calling the small blind.\n\nAction  \n[Raise 60]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nMy current hand is K\u2666, 3\u2663. This is a weak, unsuited King.\nPlayer 0 (P0) is in the Small Blind (SB) and has raised to 80 chips. This is a 4x open from their initial 20 chip bet, which is a significant raise.\nI am in the Big Blind (BB) and have already put in 10 chips. My current bet is 10 chips, and I need to call 70 more chips to match P0's raise.\nThe pot is currently 90 chips. If I call, the pot will be 160 chips (90 + 70).\nMy Stack: 850 chips. P0's Stack: 1060 chips.\nThis is the last hand (Hand 10/10). Chip stacks are important for the final outcome. P0 currently has more chips.\n\nRelevant Poker Principles:\n1.  **Hand Strength:** K3o is a very weak hand pre-flop. It struggles to make strong pairs and has no flush or straight potential without significant board runouts.\n2.  **Position:** I am in the Big Blind, which generally offers a positional advantage post-flop as I act last. However, in this specific pre-flop situation, P0's raise puts pressure on me to call out of position if I proceed.\n3.  **Opponent Tendencies (reads):** P0 has been very aggressive in prior hands, frequently raising pre-flop and winning pots unchallenged (Hands 4, 8, 9). This aggressive tendency suggests they might be raising with a wider range of hands, but it also means they are willing to put chips into the pot. Their significant raise here (4x) in the SB might indicate either a strong hand or continued aggression.\n4.  **Pot Odds for Calling:** I need to call 70 chips to win a pot that will be 160 chips (if I call). This means I am getting 160/70 \u2248 2.28 to 1 pot odds. This is not terrible mathematically if I thought my hand had good equity, but K3o generally doesn't.\n5.  **Implied Odds / Reverse Implied Odds:** With a weak hand like K3o, even if I hit a King, it's often to a weaker kicker, which can lead to losing a bigger pot (reverse implied odds). I'm unlikely to flop a monster.\n6.  **Tournament Dynamics (Last Hand):** Since this is the last hand, there's no \"next hand\" to recover chips. Every decision is final. My primary goal is to win chips, and currently, P0 has more chips. Folding here preserves my stack, but calling/raising would be a risky play to try and catch up or win. Given my weak hand and P0's aggression, this feels like a spot where they are trying to take it down or have a strong hand.\n\nEvaluation:\n*   Calling with K3o against an aggressive raise is a losing proposition in the long run. My hand has very low equity against P0's likely raising range (which could be anything from broadway cards to any pair, or just a bluff).\n*   Raising is out of the question with K3o; it would be a huge bluff into an aggressive opponent and would commit a substantial portion of my stack with poor equity.\n*   Folding preserves my chip stack and avoids putting more money into a pot with a dominated hand. While P0 is ahead in chips right now, preserving chips is generally prudent when facing aggression with a weak hand, especially in a final hand scenario where a large loss would guarantee losing the game.\n\nGiven the hand strength, the opponent's aggression, and the pot odds, folding is the most disciplined and statistically sound decision. I avoid burning chips on a marginal hand against an opponent who has shown willingness to bet large.\n[Fold]",
