My mistake. I should aim for a net positive value gain.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. I have a lot of Brick and Ore. My Wheat and Wood are relatively low value, but I don't have a large quantity of them. Sheep seem like a good middling resource.\n\nI want to acquire more high-value resources, especially Ore, by giving up lower-value resources.\n\nConsider an offer where I give up some Brick, and perhaps some Wheat or Wood, for Ore.\n\nOffer Idea 1: Trade Brick and Wood for Ore.\nValue of 21 Brick = 21 * 21 = 441\nValue of 19 Ore = 19 * 33 = 627\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (3 * 21 = 63) and 2 Wood (2 * 12 = 24) = 87 value\nAnd request 2 Ore (2 * 33 = 66)\nThis is not a good trade for me (87 out, 66 in).\n\nI need to be careful with the values.\nLet's try to get Ore by offering resources where I have a surplus, particularly Brick.\n\nScenario: Sacrifice some Brick and maybe some less valuable resources to get more Ore.\nMy Brick: 21 (Value 21)\nMy Ore: 19 (Value 33)\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (value 21) for 1 Wheat (value 6) and 1 Wood (value 12)? Net loss.\n\nLet's try to get Ore from lower value resources.\n1 Ore (33)\nIf I offer:\n- 2 Wheat (2*6=12) + 1 Wood (1*12=12) + 1 Sheep (1*14=14) = 38 value. For 1 Ore (33 value). Still bad.\n\nWhat if Player 0 needs Brick or Sheep?\n\nLet's try to make an offer where I am giving up more total quantity of lower-value resources for less quantity of higher-value resources.\n\nMy target: Increase Ore or Sheep.\nMy surplus: Brick.\n\nHow about I offer some Brick for Ore?\nIf 1 Brick (21) for 1 Ore (33) is too good for me, Player 0 won't accept.\n2 Brick (42) for 1 Ore (33) is bad for me.\n\nLet's aim for a small positive gain for me, but still fair enough for Player 0 to consider.\n\nConsider my previous offer by Player 0: 5 Wheat (30), 10 Wood (120) -> 8 Brick (168), 3 Ore (99).\nPlayer 0 offered 150 value for 267 value. This was extremely bad for me.\n\nLet's focus on my own resources again.\nWheat: 8 (6)\nWood: 11 (12)\nSheep: 6 (14)\nBrick: 21 (21)\nOre: 19 (33)\n\nI have a lot of Brick. And a decent amount of Wood and Ore.\nIf I have too many of one resource, its marginal value to me might be lower than its face value. But the game only gives a face value.\n\nHow about acquiring Sheep? Their value is 14. Less than Brick (21) or Ore (33).\nBut I only have 6 Sheep. Getting more could be useful for diversification.\n\nOffer 1: Trade Brick for Ore.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (63 value) for 2 Ore (66 value). This is a slight gain for me. (66-63 = +3 value).\nThis might be too close to call for Player 0 to accept.\n\nLet's try to offload some Brick for something more valuable.\nOffer 2: Trade Brick for Sheep and Ore.\nIf I offer 5 Brick (5 * 21 = 105 value)\nAnd request 3 Sheep (3 * 14 = 42) and 2 Ore (2 * 33 = 66) = 108 value.\nThis gives me a +3 value. This seems fair, and I am converting a resource I have a lot of (Brick) into a higher-value resource (Ore) and a middle-value resource (Sheep) that I don't have much of.\n\nLet's go with this.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 3 Sheep, 2 Ore]",
