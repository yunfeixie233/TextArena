      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first calculate the total value of the resources I currently have.\n\n1. Wheat: 22 * 6 = 132\n2. Wood: 5 * 8 = 40\n3. Sheep: 13 * 13 = 169\n4. Brick: 11 * 27 = 297\n5. Ore: 13 * 37 = 481\n\nTotal value = 132 + 40 + 169 + 297 + 481 = 1119\n\nNow, let's analyze the resources and their values to identify potential trades that could increase my total value.\n\nThe highest value resource I have is Ore, followed by Brick. To increase my total value, I should consider trading resources that are relatively less valuable for those that are more valuable.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of my Wheat (the least valuable resource per unit) or other less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nLet's examine a possible trade:\n\n- I have a lot of Wheat (22 units), which is relatively less valuable compared to others. Offering some Wheat for a resource that is more valuable could be beneficial.\n\nConsidering the values:\n- Ore (37 per unit) and Brick (27 per unit) are the most valuable.\n- Sheep (13 per unit) is moderately valuable.\n\nTo make a trade offer, I need to think about what I can afford to give away and what I can gain.\n\nFor example, I could offer:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]'  \nThis involves giving away resources worth (5*6) + (1*8) = 30 + 8 = 38 for 1 Brick worth 27. This is not a good trade since I'm getting less value.\n\nLet's think about another trade:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'  \nThis involves giving away 4 Wheat worth (4*6) = 24 for 1 Ore worth 37. This is a good trade as I'm gaining value (37 - 24 = 13).\n\nSo, a potential first offer could be:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n\nSince I have 22 Wheat, I can afford to offer 4 Wheat.\n\nMy action for Turn 1:\n```\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n```",

      "response": "To make the next move, let's first assess the current situation:\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 22 - 5 = 17 (since 5 Wheat were offered and the trade was accepted)\n   - Wood: 5 - 1 = 4 (since 1 Wood was offered and the trade was accepted)\n   - Sheep: 13\n   - Brick: 11 + 1 = 12 (since 1 Brick was requested and the trade was accepted)\n   - Ore: 13\n\n2. **New Quantities and Total Values:**\n   - Wheat: Qty: 17, Value: 6. Total = 17 * 6 = 102\n   - Wood: Qty: 4, Value: 8. Total = 4 * 8 = 32\n   - Sheep: Qty: 13, Value: 13. Total = 13 * 13 = 169\n   - Brick: Qty: 12, Value: 27. Total = 12 * 27 = 324\n   - Ore: Qty: 13, Value: 37. Total = 13 * 37 = 481\n\n3. **Total Value of Resources:** 102 + 32 + 169 + 324 + 481 = 1108\n\nLet's analyze the trade that just happened:\n- We gave away 5 Wheat (Value: 5*6 = 30) and 1 Wood (Value: 8) for 1 Brick (Value: 27). \n- The total value given away is 30 + 8 = 38.\n- The value received is 27.\n- This trade resulted in a loss of value (38 given away vs 27 received), so it was not beneficial in terms of total value.\n\nTo increase our total value, we should aim for trades that give us more value than we give away. Let's consider the current quantities and values:\n\nWe should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but in a beneficial quantity. \n\nNoting the values per resource:\n- Ore is the most valuable (37 per unit), followed by Brick (27), Sheep (13), Wood (8), and then Wheat (6).\n\nA potential trade could involve giving away some of our Wheat (least valuable per unit) or Wood (since we have relatively fewer of them) for something more valuable.\n\n**Proposed Trade:**\nWe have a good quantity of Sheep and Ore, which are high in value. Let's consider a trade that doesn't deplete our high-value resources but potentially gains more value.\n\nGiven our current quantities and the fact that we have relatively fewer Wood, let's propose a trade that involves Wood or Wheat for a more valuable resource. However, we've just reduced our Wood quantity, so let's be cautious with that.\n\nLet's think about a reasonable trade:\n- Offering some Wheat (less valuable) for something more valuable.\n\n**Trade Offer:**\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]' is a potential offer because Sheep is more valuable than Wheat. \n\nLet's calculate:\n- 4 Wheat = 4 * 6 = 24\n- 1 Sheep = 1 * 13 = 13\n\nThis isn't a good trade for us since we're getting less value than we're giving away.\n\nLet's consider another option:\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]' is not good because 1 Ore = 37 and 2 Wheat = 12, totaling 49, while 3 Brick = 3 * 27 = 81, which is more but still not a huge gain considering we're giving away valuable Ore.\n\nA potentially beneficial trade could be:\n'[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]' \n- 3 Wood = 3 * 8 = 24\n- 1 Ore = 1 * 37 = 37\n\nThis results in a gain (37 received vs 24 given away), so it's a good trade.\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\n'[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]'",
