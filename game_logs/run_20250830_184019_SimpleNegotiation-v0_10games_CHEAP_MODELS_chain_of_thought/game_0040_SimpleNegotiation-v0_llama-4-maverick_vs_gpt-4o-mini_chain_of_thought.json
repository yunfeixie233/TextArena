To achieve this, we need to identify which resources are relatively overvalued or undervalued compared to their game value and try to trade the overvalued ones for more valuable resources or the same value resources that are scarce or needed.\n\n#### Observation:\n1. **Value per Unit**: The resources already have assigned values. Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n2. **Quantity and Value**: We have a significant quantity of Ore, Brick, and Wheat.\n\n#### First Turn:\nTo start, let's analyze potential trades. We should look to trade resources that are less valuable or abundant for those that are more valuable or scarcer.\n\nLet's examine a potential trade:\n- We can offer some Wheat (less valuable) and possibly some other less valuable resources for something more valuable.\n\n#### Trade Offer:\nLet's make an initial offer to see how the opponent responds. We'll offer 5 Wheat (relatively less valuable) and see if we can get something slightly more valuable in return.\n\nConsidering the opponent might be interested in Wheat for some reason or might have something we value more, let's propose:\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood]`\n\nThis offer is made to test the waters, and we are willing to negotiate based on the opponent's response.\n\n#### Action:\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood]`\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response to either accept, deny, or make a counteroffer.",
