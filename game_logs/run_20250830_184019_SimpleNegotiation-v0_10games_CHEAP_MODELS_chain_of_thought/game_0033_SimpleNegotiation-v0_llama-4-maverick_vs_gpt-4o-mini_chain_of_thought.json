We have a good quantity of Ore but a relatively low quantity of Brick.\n\nTo increase the total value, acquiring more Brick or maintaining the high-value resources is crucial.\n\nLet's make an offer to gain more Brick since it's highly valued and we have a relatively low quantity.\n\n### Offer\n`[Offer: 4 Ore, 3 Sheep -> 5 Brick]`\n\nThis offer aims to exchange some of our valuable Ore and Sheep for Brick, which is also valuable but currently in short supply with us.\n\n### Rationale\n- We're offering 4 Ore (Value: 4*32 = 128) and 3 Sheep (Value: 3*15 = 45), totaling a value of 173.\n- We're requesting 5 Brick (Value: 5*28 = 140).\n- The offer is somewhat balanced, with a slight inclination towards gaining less value. However, it aims to adjust our resource composition to potentially higher total value or more balanced resources for future trades.\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.",
