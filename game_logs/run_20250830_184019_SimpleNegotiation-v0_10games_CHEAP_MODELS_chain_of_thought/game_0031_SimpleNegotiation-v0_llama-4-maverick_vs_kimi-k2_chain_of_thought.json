      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first calculate the total value of the resources I currently have.\n\n1. Wheat: 13 * 5 = 65\n2. Wood: 5 * 11 = 55\n3. Sheep: 11 * 15 = 165\n4. Brick: 22 * 30 = 660\n5. Ore: 7 * 36 = 252\n\nTotal Value = 65 + 55 + 165 + 660 + 252 = 1197\n\nTo improve the total value, I should look for trades that give me resources of higher value compared to what I'm offering. Let's examine the resources I have and potential trades:\n\n- I have a lot of Brick (Value: 30) and some Ore (Value: 36). I should try to trade these for resources with higher values if possible or maintain a good balance.\n- The highest value resource I have is Ore, followed by Brick. Sheep is also relatively valuable compared to Wheat and Wood.\n\nLet's start by making an offer that could potentially increase my total value. Since Ore is my most valuable resource per unit, I should be cautious about trading it away. However, I can consider trading some of my less valuable resources or quantities of resources that won't significantly impact my total value.\n\nGiven my resources, I could offer to trade some Wheat (the least valuable resource per unit) or a combination of resources for something more valuable.\n\n### Turn 1 Offer\nI will offer: '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'  \nThis is a speculative offer since Sheep is more valuable than Wheat. However, the ratio is somewhat reasonable as 5 Wheat = 25 value, and 1 Sheep = 15 value. It's not an ideal trade for me, but it's a start.\n\nLet's see how the other player responds.\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'",

Since Ore has the highest value, we should consider trading for it if possible. However, we need to see what Player 1 has to offer.\n\nLet's review the previous trades and offers:\n- We traded 5 Wheat for 1 Sheep.\n- We traded 3 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n- Player 1 offered 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, which we rejected.\n- We traded 4 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n- Player 1 offered 5 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Ore, which we rejected.\n\nConsidering the remaining resources and the goal to increase the total value, we should look for a trade that benefits us. Since we have very little Wheat left, we should avoid trading it away.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of our less valuable resources for something more valuable or at least equally valuable.\n\nLet's make an offer to trade some of our Wheat (the least valuable resource we have, but we don't have much of it anyway) is not a good idea. However, we could consider trading some other resource.\n\n## Step 1: Evaluate the current state of resources.\nWe have 1 Wheat, 5 Wood, 12 Sheep, 22 Brick, and 9 Ore.\n\n## Step 2: Consider potential trades based on resource values.\nThe most valuable resources are Ore (36), Brick (30), Sheep (15), Wood (11), and Wheat (5). We should try to get more of the higher-value resources.\n\n## Step 3: Look at the previous interactions to understand Player 1's behavior.\nPlayer 1 accepted trades that gave them Wheat and rejected or didn't make offers that didn't give them a clear advantage in terms of getting Ore for Wheat or other low-value resources.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a trade offer based on the analysis.\nSince we are running low on Wheat and need to maximize our total value, let's consider offering some of our less valuable resources for Ore or other valuable resources. However, we need to be cautious as we don't know exactly what Player 1 has.\n\n## Step 5: Make a trade offer.\nLet's offer 2 Wood (value: 22) for 1 Ore (value: 36). This is a potentially beneficial trade as we gain more value than we lose.\n\nThe trade offer would be: [Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]}$",
