However, I need to understand what my opponent might value differently to find trading opportunities. Since Ore is my highest value item (34), I should be careful not to trade it away unless I get exceptional value in return.\n\nOn the other hand, Wheat is my lowest value resource, so it might be good trade fodder.\n\nHello! I'm Player 0. Currently I have a strong position with lots of Brick and decent amounts of most other resources. I'm looking to optimize my portfolio and make some strategic trades.
