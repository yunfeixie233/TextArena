      "response": "### Current Situation Analysis\n\n**My Current Resources and Values:**\n- Wheat: 11 qty * 6 = 66\n- Wood: 24 qty * 9 = 216\n- Sheep: 23 qty * 13 = 299\n- Brick: 12 qty * 24 = 288\n- Ore: 6 qty * 39 = 234\n**Total Current Value:** 66 + 216 + 299 + 288 + 234 = 1103\n\n**Observations:**\n1. **Brick** has the highest value per unit (24). Both players seem to be trying to acquire it.\n2. **Ore** has the next highest value (39), but I have very little (only 6).\n3. I have a lot of **Wood** (24) and **Sheep** (23), both with mid-range values (9 and 13 respectively).\n4. Player 1 is consistently asking for Brick and/or Ore in their offers, offering low-value items (Wheat, Sheep, Wood) in return.\n\n### Evaluating Player 1's Latest Offer\n\n**Player 1's Offer:** 5 Sheep + 2 Wheat \u2192 4 Brick + 1 Ore\n\n- **What Player 1 gives me:**\n  - 5 Sheep * 13 = 65\n  - 2 Wheat * 6 = 12\n  - Total from their side: 65 + 12 = 77\n\n- **What I give them:**\n  - 4 Brick * 24 = 96\n  - 1 Ore * 39 = 39\n  - Total from my side: 96 + 39 = 135\n\n**Net Change if I Accept:** +77 - 135 = -58\n\nThis trade would reduce my total value by 58 points, which is unfavorable.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward\n\nPlayer 1's offers consistently undervalue what they're giving me and overvalue what they're requesting. They seem desperate for Brick and Ore, offering low-value items in exchange. \n\nSince Brick is highly valuable, I should aim to acquire more, not less. Similarly, Ore is scarce for me (only 6) and very valuable, so I shouldn't trade it away unless getting something significantly better.\n\n### My Next Move\n\nSince Player 1 is not offering fair trades, and the last few turns have seen no progress, I should try to make an offer that is more appealing to them but still gives me value. However, based on their pattern, they seem unwilling to trade Brick for anything but Ore, which is not in my interest.\n\nInstead, to increase my total value, I should focus on trading my abundant low-value resources (Wood, Sheep, Wheat) to get more high-value Brick or Ore. \n\nBut since Player 1 isn't giving good deals, perhaps I should make a slightly better offer based on their previous patterns.\n\n**New Offer:**\nLooking at their previous offers, they seem to value Brick very highly. Maybe I can offer more Sheep/Wood/Wheat for fewer Brick.\n\n- I have 23 Sheep (value 13), 24 Wood (value 9), 11 Wheat (value 6). These are my excess.\n- I want Brick (value 24) and Ore (value 39).\n\nPerhaps offer a higher quantity of lower-value items for fewer Brick.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\nGive: 6 Sheep + 3 Wood + 2 Wheat = 6*13 + 3*9 + 2*6 = 78 + 27 + 12 = 117\nAsk: 4 Brick = 4*24 = 96\nNet for me: +96 - 117 = -21 (still negative, but better than earlier offers)\n\nThis still isn\u2019t great. Maybe adjust:\n\nGive: 5 Sheep + 2 Wood + 1 Wheat = 65 + 18 + 6 = 89\nAsk: 3 Brick = 72\nNet: +72 - 89 = -17 (slightly better, but still a loss)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should focus on trading to get Ore, since I have very few. But Player 1 likely values Ore highly too.\n\nGiven the pattern, Player 1 seems unlikely to accept anything reasonable. Maybe I should make a small, reasonable offer to test the waters.\n\n**Best possible offer:**\nGiven that Brick is highly valued, and Player 1 wants Ore, perhaps offer Sheep/Wood/Wheat for Brick only, without touching Ore.\n\nLet\u2019s offer:\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 3 Brick]\n\nCalculation:\nGive: 5*13 + 2*9 + 1*6 = 65 + 18 + 6 = 89\nAsk: 3*24 = 72\nNet: +72 - 89 = -17 (still a loss, but better than -58 from their offer)\n\nAlternatively, maybe 4 Sheep, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat for 2 Brick:\nGive: 4*13 + 1*9 + 1*6 = 52 + 9 + 6 = 67\nAsk: 2*24 = 48\nNet: +48 - 67 = -19\n\nThis isn\u2019t improving. It seems Player 1 is asking for too much Brick per unit offered.\n\n### Re-evaluating Strategy\n\nSince all my attempts to gain Brick result in a net loss given Player 1\u2019s valuation, and Ore is too valuable to give up, perhaps I should focus on consolidating my Sheep/Wood/Wheat for slightly better value without Brick/ore.\n\nBut the problem is Brick and Ore are the high-value items, and others are low. \n\nGiven that, and since Brick is 24, Ore 39, and others <14, the only way to increase value is trade up these, but Player 1 seems to value Brick even higher (since they want so much for it).\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should make an offer that is very skewed in my favor to see if they bite, because their offers are very skewed against me.\n\nFor example:\n[Offer: 6 Wood, 3 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]\n\nGive: 6*9 + 3*6 + 3*13 = 54 + 18 + 39 = 111\nAsk: 2*24 + 1*39 = 48 + 39 = 87\nNet: +87 - 111 = -24 (still bad)\n\nThis seems impossible to make a net-positive trade with Brick at 24 and Ore at 39, given others are so low.\n\n### Realization\n\nActually, the reason all my trades are net-negative is because the values assigned are relative within the game, and the opponent seems unwilling to trade unless they're gaining significant value. \n\nGiven that, the best I can do is minimize loss while trying to get high-value items. \n\nThus, the least loss so far is -17 with:\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 3 Brick]\n\nBut this is terrible. Maybe there's no beneficial trade, and I should wait it out.\n\nHowever, the game lasts 10 turns, and some turns must involve trades to progress.\n\n### Optimal Offer\n\nGiven the constraints, I\u2019ll make a counteroffer to their last one, but adjusted to be more reasonable (even if still a net loss):\n\nOriginal from them: 5 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 4 Brick, 1 Ore (net for me: -58)\nMy counter: something less extreme.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]\n\nCalculation:\nGive: 3*13 + 1*6 = 39 + 6 = 45\nAsk: 1*24 + 1*39 = 24 + 39 = 63\nNet: +63 - 45 = +18 (!!!)\n\nThis is actually positive for me!  \n\nBut they might reject. Let me try:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]  \nGive: 45, Ask: 48, Net: +3 (positive)\n\nEven better, and likely more appealing to them than my earlier offers.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThis is the best I\u2019ve calculated:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]\n\nIt\u2019s slightly in my favor (+3), reasonable, and gives me more Brick (high value) giving away Sheep and Wheat (lower values). \n\n**Action Taken:**\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",
