      "response": "I need to make a new offer to Player 0. My goal is to increase the total value of my resources.\n\nCurrent resources:\n*   Wheat: 21 (Value: 5)\n*   Wood: 17 (Value: 9)\n*   Sheep: 14 (Value: 17)\n*   Brick: 5 (Value: 30)\n*   Ore: 22 (Value: 39)\n\nPlayer 0 rejected my last offer of 1 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Sheep.\nMy offer: (1 * 5) + (1 * 9) = 14\nPlayer 0's offer: (1 * 17) = 17\nThis offer was not favorable to Player 0. I was losing 3 in value based on my valuations. However Player 0 rejected it. Let us try to make a profitable one for me, and also for the opponent.\n\nLet's try to trade some Wheat for something more valuable like Wood or Sheep.\nHow about trading Wheat and Wood for Brick or Ore?\n\nConsider an offer where I give 5 Wheat (value 25) and request 1 Wood (value 9) and 1 Sheep (value 17).\nNet loss for me: 25 - (9 + 17) = 25 - 26 = -1 (not good for me)\n\nLet's try to get more Sheep or Brick.\nI have plenty of Wheat and Wood.\nWhat if I offer 11 Wood (value 9 * 11 = 99) for 3 Brick (value 3 * 30 = 90)?\nThis is a net loss of 9 for me. Not an increase in value for me.\n\nLet's look for resources that I have a lot of and are low value, and trade for resources that are high value.\nI have 21 Wheat (value 5).\nI have 17 Wood (value 9).\nI have 14 Sheep (value 17).\nI have 5 Brick (value 30).\nI have 22 Ore (value 39).\n\nTrading 5 Wheat for 1 Wood: Value 25 -> Value 9. Not good.\nTrading 3 Wood for 1 Sheep: Value 27 -> Value 17. Not good.\n\nLet's try offering low-value items for higher-value items.\nOffer Wood and Wheat for Brick.\nWhat if I offer 6 Wood (value 54) + 6 Wheat (value 30) = 84\nFor 3 Brick (value 90)?\nThis would be a gain of 6 for me (90 - 84 = 6).\nPlayer 0 would receive 84 in value and give 90 in value. This is a loss for player 0. Player 0 rejected previously more favorable deals for them.\n\nLet's try to make an offer where I acquire a more valuable resource directly. For example, getting Ore or Brick.\n\nCurrent strategy: Target acquiring Brick or Ore, giving away Wheat or Wood.\n\nOffer: 10 Wheat (Value 50) for 1 Brick (Value 30) and 1 Wood (Value 9). Total 39. Not good for me.\n\nWhat about trading some Ore, which I have a lot of, for something to increase diversity or for a better value? No, I want to gain more value. Ore is my most valuable.\n\nLet\u2019s propose something to gain more Ore or Brick.\n\nOffer: 3 Sheep (Value 51) for 1 Ore (Value 39). This is a loss for me.\n\nLet's consider an offer that's profitable for me and *could* be attractive to Player 0.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Wood.\nWhat about offering 10 Wheat and 5 Wood for 2 Brick?\nMy offer: (10 * 5) + (5 * 9) = 50 + 45 = 95\nRequested: (2 * 30) = 60\nThis is a loss of 35 for me.\n\nLet's ensure the requested value is higher than the offered value for me.\nI want to get Ore or Brick.\n\nMy most valuable resource is Ore (39). My least valuable is Wheat (5).\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat and Wood for Ore.\nOffer: 10 Wheat (value 50) + 10 Wood (value 90) = 140\nFor: 3 Ore (value 117)\nLoss for me: 140 - 117 = 23 (bad)\n\nLet's try to trade high quantity low value in exchange for low quantity high value.\nOffer: 15 Wheat (value 75)\nRequest: 2 Sheep (value 34) and 1 Wood (value 9). Total 43. Still a huge loss for me.\n\nLet's make a slight tweak to my last rejected offer, but making it more favorable *for me* in terms of value. My previous rejected offer was 1 Wheat, 1 Wood (14) for 1 Sheep (17). My side was losing 3 in value. And Player 0 rejected it too for some reason. Perhaps Player 0 values Wheat/Wood higher too.\n\nLet's try to simplify.\nMy resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 21   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 17   Value: 9\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 14   Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 5    Value: 30\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 22   Value: 39\n\nWhat if I offer a lot of Wheat for a single higher-value item?\nOffer 10 Wheat (value 50) for 2 Sheep (value 34). This gives me a loss of 16.\n\nI should be getting more value for what I offer.\nOffer: 3 Wood (value 27) for 1 Brick (value 30). This would be a gain of 3 for me.\nThe opponent would value this as giving 30 and getting 27. A loss of 3 for them. But since I have a surplus of Wood and they may need it, this might pass.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
