Player 0 twice proposed \u201c2 Wheat & 2 Wood for 1 Ore & 1 Brick\u201d.\n   \u2013 Loss for me: I would give away 2\u00d75 + 2\u00d78 = 26 value and receive 40 + 24 = 64 value \u2192 a surplus of +38.  \n   \u2013 Nevertheless I denied both offers because those were low-volume transactions and Ore + Brick are the scarcest resources. Retaining them keeps better leverage for larger deals.\n\n2. I proposed \u201c3 Sheep & 2 Ore \u2192 5 Wheat & 2 Sheep\u201d.\n   \u2013 This was an attempt to obtain bulk Wheat at a discount while off-loading a bit of Ore.  \n   \u2013 Net for me: 30 (3 Sheep) + 80 (2 Ore) = 110 given, 25\u00d75 + 30 = 125 received \u2192 +15 value and more Bread-making capacity. Player 0 declined.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTurn summary (public so far):\n\n- Rejections on both sides imply both of us value Ore and Brick more than Wheat/Wood, but Player 0 may specifically hoard Brick while I already have 16 of them (supply is not an issue for me).  \n- My Ore stock (18 units, 720 value) is the single biggest asset in play and hence my best bargaining chip.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStrategy for the next turn:\n\nI want to turn some of my abundant Brick and relatively mediocre Sheep into more high-value Ore, or into Wheat bundles if I can get a 2-for-1 type deal.  \nI believe Player 0 lacks Brick; so let me test the waters with a high-margin offer.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick, 3 Sheep -> 5 Wheat, 4 Ore]\n\nValue to me if accepted: 120 (5 Brick) + 45 (3 Sheep) = 165 given vs 25 (5 Wheat) + 160 (4 Ore) = 185 received \u2192 +20 value and a nice Ore boost. Even if Player 0 bargains downward, I still have strong margins.\n\nI\u2019m ready to listen to Player 0\u2019s counter next.",
