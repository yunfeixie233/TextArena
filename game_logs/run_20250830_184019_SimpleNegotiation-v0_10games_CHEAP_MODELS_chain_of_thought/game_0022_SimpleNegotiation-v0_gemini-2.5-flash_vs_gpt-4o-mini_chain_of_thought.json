Player 1 rejected this offer.\nPlayer 1 made no new trade offer.\n\nYou need to make a trade offer to Player 1, or accept/deny an offer from Player 1.\nYou want to increase the total value of your resources.\n\nHere's a breakdown of values:\n- Wheat: 6\n- Wood: 12\n- Sheep: 17\n- Brick: 20\n- Ore: 34\n\nYour goal is to acquire higher-value resources by giving away lower-value resources.\n\nYour previously rejected offer was 3 Sheep (51 total value) for 1 Ore (34 total value). This was a bad offer for Player 1, as they would lose value. You need to create an offer that is more appealing to Player 1, while still benefiting you.\n\nLet's try to get Ore (34) or Brick (20) by offering Sheep (17), Wood (12), or Wheat (6).\n\nConsider an offer where you gain value:\n- To get 1 Ore (34), you could offer something worth slightly less or equal.\n  - If you offer 2 Sheep (34), that's a fair 1-for-2 trade of the same value.\n  - If you offer 3 Wood (36), that's also a close trade.\n\nSince you have very few Sheep (5), perhaps it's better to hold onto them unless the return is very good.\nYou have a good amount of Brick (14), Wood (18), Wheat (17), and Ore (18).\n\nLet's try an offer that makes sense for both players.\nScenario: You want Ore or Brick. Player 1 likely wants the same or something they are short on.\n\nYou have 18 Ore, which is a lot. Maybe you can trade some for Brick if you need more Brick.\nHowever, Ore is the highest value resource. You should try to acquire it.\n\nLet's try to get Ore or Brick by giving away Wheat or Wood.\nWhat if you offer multiple low-value items for one high-value item?\n\nYou have plenty of Wheat (17) and Wood (18).\nWhat if you offer 3 Wood (36) for 1 Ore (34)? This is slightly in Player 1's favor, but you get a higher value resource.\nOr 2 Wood (24) and 1 Wheat (6) = 30 for 1 Brick (20)? This is bad for you.\n\nLet's make an offer where you clearly gain value.\nYou have 14 Brick. If you get more Brick, your total value goes up.\nYou have 5 Sheep. You offered them before.\n\nLet's make an offer focusing on volume of lower value to get a higher value item.\nYou have plenty of Wheat and Wood.\nWhat about offering 4 Wheat (24) for 1 Brick (20)? Player 1 gains 4 value. You convert low value to higher value.\nWhat about offering 3 Wood (36) for 1 Ore (34)? Player 1 gains 2 value. You convert medium value to higher value.\n\nLet's try to be slightly more aggressive to increase your overall value, but not so much that it's rejected.\nIf you offer 2 Sheep (34) for 1 Ore (34), that's a direct swap of value. It's fair. You reduce your quantity of Sheep but get Ore, which might be helpful for future trades.\nWhat if Player 1 is low on Sheep?\n\nLet's try to get Brick. You have 14.\nCurrent top values: Ore (34), Brick (20), Sheep (17), Wood (12), Wheat (6)\n\nOffer something where you gain.\nExample: Offer 3 Wood (Value 36) for 2 Sheep (Value 34). Player 1 gains 2 value. You get two of a higher-valued resource. You have 18 Wood; can spare 3. You only have 5 Sheep, so gaining more is good.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again. You have 18 Ore.\nWhat if you offer a combination of lower value items for 1 Ore?\nOffer: 1 Wood (12) and 1 Sheep (17) = 29. You want 1 Ore (34). This gives you a gain of 5. Player 1 loses 5 value. This is likely to be rejected.\n\nYou must make an offer that Player 1 might accept.\nPlayer 1 rejected 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore from you (Value loss for Player 1).\nYou need to offer something where Player 1 doesn't lose value, or ideally gains a little.\n\nLet's offer a slight gain for Player 1, while changing your resource composition towards higher value or reducing lower value excess.\nYou have 17 Wheat and 18 Wood. These are your lowest value per unit resources.\nTrading these for higher value per unit resources is good.\n\nHow about trying for 1 Brick? (Value 20)\nYou could offer 2 Wood (Value 24). Player 1 gains 4. You get a higher value resource.\nOr you could offer 4 Wheat (Value 24). Player 1 gains 4. You get a higher value resource.\n\nLet's try to get a Brick. You have plenty of Wheat.\n\"[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\"\nYour Value: 4 * 6 = 24. Requested Value: 1 * 20 = 20. You lose 4 value.\nThis is not good for you because you lose value.\n\nYou need to *gain* value.\nLet's re-evaluate.\nYou give X, you get Y. You want Value(Y) > Value(X).\nPlayer 1 will only accept if Value(Y) from their perspective > Value(X) from their perspective, ideally. So Value(X_you) from you < Value(Y_you) from you, and for them Value(X_them) from them > Value(Y_them) from them. This is the challenge.\n\nLet's consider a scenario where you give \"more\" resources but of lower value.\nYou have 18 Ore, a good quantity.\nWhat if you trade some high-value Ore for other high-value items, if the exchange is favorable?\nE.g., 1 Ore (34) for 2 Brick (40). Player 1 gains 6. You gain 6. This is a great deal if accepted.\n\nLet's try a different approach. You have 18 Wood.\nWhat if you offer 1 Wood (12) for 1 Wheat (6)? That's terrible for you.\n\nLet's consider your previous offer: 3 Sheep (51) -> 1 Ore (34). Player 1 rejected because they lose 17 value.\nTo make it appealing to Player 1, you need to offer valuable items for items they value less. No, this is wrong. You offer items you value less for items you value more.\n\nYour goal: Increase total value.\nResources: Wheat (6), Wood (12), Sheep (17), Brick (20), Ore (34).\n\nLet's think of what Player 1 might need or what would be a good deal for them.\nYou have 18 Ore. You have a lot of Ore. Player 1 might want Ore.\nWhat if you offer 1 Ore (34) for 2 Brick (40)? This is good for both.\nYou lose 1 Ore, but gain 2 Brick. Your quantity of Brick goes up for useful value.\nYou: 1 Ore (34) -> 2 Brick (40). You gain 6 value.\nPlayer 1: 2 Brick (40) -> 1 Ore (34). Player 1 loses 6 value. This is bad for Player 1. They won't accept.\n\nIt must be a gain for both or perceived as a gain for Player 1.\n\nLet's offer a trade where you give lower-value resources for higher-value resources.\nYou have 17 Wheat and 18 Wood.\nWhat if you offer 2 Wood (24) for 1 Brick (20)? You lose 4 points. No.\n\nLet's try offering items you have a lot of the lowest value.\nYou have 17 Wheat (6).\nConsider trading Wheat for Sheep (17).\nIf you offer 3 Wheat (18) for 1 Sheep (17). You gain 1. Player 1 loses 1 value. They might accept if they are desperate for Wheat and have too many Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get Ore or Brick.\nYou want to give up low-value items (Wheat, Wood) for high-value items (Ore, Brick).\n\nOffer: 2 Wheat (12) and 1 Wood (12) for 1 Ore (34). Total gain for you = 34 - 24 = 10.\nPlayer 1 loses 10 value. Probably rejected.\n\nYou need to make an offer that is fair or slightly beneficial to Player 1, but still increases your total value.\nLet's propose: [Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep].\nYour calculation: You give 2 Wood (2 * 12 = 24). You receive 1 Sheep (1 * 17 = 17). This is a loss of 7 for you. Bad.\n\nLet's focus on gaining value.\nYou have:\n- Wheat: 17 @ 6 = 102\n- Wood: 18 @ 12 = 216\n- Sheep: 5 @ 17 = 85\n- Brick: 14 @ 20 = 280\n- Ore: 18 @ 34 = 612\nTotal Value: 1295\n\nYou want to make a trade where you get *more* value than you give.\nFor Player 1 to accept, they likely need to gain value or see it as a good trade for them.\n\nHow about offering more quantity of lower value items for less quantity of higher value items?\nExample: 3 Wood (36 value) for 1 Ore (34 value).\nYou: Give 3 Wood (36), Get 1 Ore (34). Your value change: -2. This is bad.\n\nLet's try:\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nYour perspective: You give 2 Wood (24) + 1 Wheat (6) = 30. You get 1 Brick (20). You lose 10 value. Bad for you.\n\nYou need to gain value.\nSo, you want to trade X for Y, where Val(Y) > Val(X).\nPlayer 1 wants to trade A for B, where Val(B) > Val(A).\nThis is a standard negotiation problem.\n\nLet's think of what Player 1 would accept. Your previous offer was 3 Sheep (51) -> 1 Ore (34). They rejected. It was very bad for them.\n\nConsider a small gain for you, with a small loss or break-even for Player 1.\nWhat if you trade 1 Ore (34) for 3 Sheep (51)? Player 1 gains 17. You lose 17. BAD FOR YOU.\n\nWhat if you offer something that benefits both, or is slightly better for Player 1?\nYour goal is to gain overall value.\nLet's target getting 1 Ore (34 value).\nWhat if you offer multiple Sheep or Brick for Ore?\nYou have 5 Sheep. You really don't want to give those up without a good return.\nYou have 14 Brick.\n\nHow about you offer 1 Brick (20) for 1 Sheep (17) and 1 Wheat (6)?\nPlayer 1's perspective: They give Sheep (17) + Wheat (6) = 23. They get Brick (20). They lose 3 value. They would probably reject.\n\nLet's make an offer where you sacrifice some lower-value resources to obtain higher-value ones.\nWhat if you offer 1 Wood (12) and 1 Wheat (6) for 1 Sheep (17)?\nTotal Offer Value: 12 + 6 = 18. Requested Value: 17. You lose 1. But you convert two low-value items into one medium-value item. This is still a direct loss.\n\nThis is tricky. You want to gain value. The opponent wants to gain value.\nThe only way for both to gain is if they value things differently. But here, all values are given.\n\nThe key must be to turn lower-value resources you have in abundance into higher-value resources, even if it's not a direct value-for-value exchange, but means you have more high-value resources afterwards.\n\nLet's analyze what Player 1 might accept from *your* inventory.\nYou have plenty of Wheat and Wood.\nWhat if you trade 4 Wheat (24) for 1 Sheep (17)? You gain 7 value. Player 1 loses 7 value. They will reject.\n\nIt seems you are expected to make offers that are slightly advantageous to Player 1, but still improve your total resource value by trading up.\n\nLet's try to get 1 Brick (20).\nOffer: 2 Sheep (34) for 1 Brick (20). You lose 14. This is bad for you.\nOffer: 1 Wheat (6) and 1 Wood (12) -> 1 Sheep (17). You lose 1.\n\nLet's consider trading 1 Ore for something else. You have plenty of Ore (18).\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]\nYour perspective: Give 1 Ore (34). Get 1 Brick (20) + 1 Sheep (17) = 37. You Gain 3.\nPlayer 1's perspective: Give 1 Brick (20) + 1 Sheep (17) = 37. Get 1 Ore (34). They Lose 3.\nThis is a reasonable offer that benefits you, and Player 1 loses only a small amount, which they might accept if they need Ore.\n\nLet's try this one. It provides you with a direct value increase, and the loss for Player 1 is not huge.\nAlso, the number of resources exchanged is not excessive.\n\nYour current resources and values:\n- Wheat: 17 * 6 = 102\n- Wood: 18 * 12 = 216\n- Sheep: 5 * 17 = 85\n- Brick: 14 * 20 = 280\n- Ore: 18 * 34 = 612\nTotal: 1295\n\nIf the offer [Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep] is accepted:\nYou give 1 Ore (-34). You gain 1 Brick (+20) and 1 Sheep (+17).\nNet value for you: -34 + 20 + 17 = +3.\nNew resources:\n- Wheat: 17\n- Wood: 18\n- Sheep: 5+1 = 6\n- Brick: 14+1 = 15\n- Ore: 18-1 = 17\nNew total value:\n17*6 + 18*12 + 6*17 + 15*20 + 17*34\n102 + 216 + 102 + 300 + 578 = 1298.\nValue increases from 1295 to 1298.\n\nThis is a good offer for you. It remains to be seen if Player 1 accepts a -3 value transaction, but it is much better than the previous -17 offer.\n\nFinal check on the format.\n\"[Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\"\n\nExample given: '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]'\nMy offer: '[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]'\n\nThis seems like a solid strategy to increase my total value, assuming Player 1 might accept a slight loss if the resource type is preferred.\nLet's analyze Player 1's possible motivations. They might need Brick or Sheep more than Ore, even if the value is slightly off. For example, if they need specific resources for building. This information is hidden from me, but it's a common game mechanic.\n\nOne more check - any alternative that might be better?\nWhat if I try to get Ore? Giving away lower value for Ore.\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nYour perspective: Give 2 Sheep (34). Get 1 Ore (34). Net 0 gain. Not ideal.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nYour perspective: Give 2 Brick (40). Get 1 Ore (34). Net -6 loss. Bad.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nYour perspective: Give 3 Wood (36). Get 1 Ore (34). Net -2 loss. Bad.\n\nSo, the previous offer [Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep] is indeed one of the rare instances where you *gain* value by giving up a higher-value resource for a combination of lower-value resources, where the combination's value exceeds the single higher-value resource. This is possible because there are a wider range of resources (Brick and Sheep) that collectively sum up to more than the single Ore. This benefits you. It might not benefit the other player.\nHowever, I have to make a move. This one increases my total value.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"offer\": {\n    \"offered_resources\": {\n      \"Ore\": 1\n    },\n    \"requested_resources\": {\n      \"Brick\": 1,\n      \"Sheep\": 1\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
