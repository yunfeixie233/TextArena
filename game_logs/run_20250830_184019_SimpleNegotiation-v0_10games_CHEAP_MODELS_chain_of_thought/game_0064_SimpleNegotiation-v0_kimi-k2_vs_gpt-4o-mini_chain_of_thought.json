I\u2019m perfectly happy converting lower-value cards into more Brick or Ore, even if it pushes my holdings very lopsided, because their per-unit value is clearly superior.\n\nEstimating rough exchange ratios:\n\n- Brick is 29; Wheat is 6: 1 Brick \u2248 5 Wheat.  \n- Ore is 35; Sheep is 16: 1 Ore \u2248 2 Sheep (or 2.2 exactly).  \n\nLooking at my own 21 Sheep (value 336) and 21 Brick (value 609), moving Sheep into Ore looks attractive.  \nA single for-instance: trading 4 Sheep (64) for 2 Ore (70) would give me a net value gain of 6, and both sides of the trade feel \u201creasonable\u201d against those value ratios.\n\nLet me test the water with a modest offer that raises my Ore count without appearing predatory.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]",
