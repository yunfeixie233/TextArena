      "response": "- **Read first**: You are Player 0. It is your turn.\n- **Goal**: Increase the total value of your resources through trades.\n- **Resources**:\n    - Wheat: 16 (Value: 5)\n    - Wood: 24 (Value: 10)\n    - Sheep: 17 (Value: 16)\n    - Brick: 21 (Value: 21)\n    - Ore: 6 (Value: 32)\n- **Total Value**: (16 * 5) + (24 * 10) + (17 * 16) + (21 * 21) + (6 * 32) = 80 + 240 + 272 + 441 + 192 = 1225\n- **Strategy**: I need to make offers that increase my total value. This means trading away resources I have in abundance or perceive as less valuable for resources I have less of or perceive as more valuable, or just generally making trades where the value gained is greater than the value given up.\n\nIt's my turn 1 out of 10. I'll make an offer.\n\nLooking at my resources, Brick and Ore have the highest individual values. Wheat has the lowest. I have a decent amount of most resources, except for Ore, which I have the least of. Acquiring more Ore would be beneficial.\n\nLet's try to trade away some lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n**Offer Idea 1**: Trade Wheat for Ore.\nValue of 1 Wheat = 5. Value of 1 Ore = 32.\nThis is a large ratio. I would need to offer many Wheat for just one Ore. For example, 6 Wheat (value 30) for 1 Ore (value 32) is close to even. But I want to gain value. So I need to get more value than I give.\nWhat if I offer 5 Wheat (value 25) for 1 Ore (value 32)? That's a gain of 7 value. I have plenty of Wheat, so I can afford to give some up.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
