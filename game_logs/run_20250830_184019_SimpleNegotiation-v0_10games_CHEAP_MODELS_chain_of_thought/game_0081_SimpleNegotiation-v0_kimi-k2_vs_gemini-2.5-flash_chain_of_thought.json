This makes sense because Player 1 values Wood (8) and Ore (35), so giving Ore for low-value Wheat/Wood isn\u2019t attractive.\n   - My second offer (7 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 4 Ore, 1 Brick) was also rejected, likely because Player 1 doesn\u2019t want to part with Ore/Brick.\n\n3. **Player 1's Offer**:\n   - Player 1 mirrored my rejected offer (7 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 4 Ore, 1 Brick). This suggests they want to test whether I value the same thing.\n   - Accepting this trade would reduce my Ore/Brick but increase Sheep/Wheat, which is not ideal for total value maximization. \n\n4. **Next Step**:\n   - Reject Player 1\u2019s offer (as it worsens my position).\n   - Propose a new trade that offers slightly less in value from my side but still targets Ore/Brick. For example, offering Sheep/Wheat for Ore/Brick at a more favorable rate for Player 1.\n\n5. **New Offer**:\n   - Offer 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat for 2 Ore, 1 Brick. This is less demanding than my last offer, giving Player 1 more incentive to accept.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "Thought process:\n\n1. **Current Situation Analysis**: I have a large quantity of Wheat (21) and Sheep (21), but they are low in value (5 and 16 respectively). On the other hand, Ore (14) and Brick (5) are high in value (35 and 29 respectively), and I have a moderate amount of Ore but very few Brick. Wood is also low in value (8), and I have 6 of them. My goal is to trade away low-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) for high-value ones (Ore, Brick).\n\n2. **Previous Offers Analysis**: \n   - Earlier offers tried to trade Wheat/Wood/Sheep for Ore/Brick, but all were rejected. This suggests Player 1 either doesn\u2019t need these resources or doesn\u2019t value them as much as I do. Alternatively, Player 1 might be stingy with Ore/Brick.\n   - Player 1\u2019s offers (7 Sheep + 5 Wheat for 4 Ore + 1 Brick, or 10 Sheep + 5 Wheat for 4 Ore) are worse than my earlier offers (e.g., 5 Sheep + 2 Wood for 4 Ore), so I rejected them. This indicates we\u2019re far from agreement.\n\n3. **Revised Strategy**: \n   - Since direct trades for Ore/Brick aren\u2019t working, I could try trading for other resources Player 1 might have more of. However, I only care about Ore and Brick (since they\u2019re high-value). Alternatively, I could sweeten the deal by offering more Sheep/Wheat/Wood for fewer Ore/Brick, prioritizing Ore (highest value).\n   - Given my surplus of Wheat and Sheep, I could offer more Wheat/Sheep per Ore/Brick to make the trade more appealing.\n\n4. **New Offer**: \n   - Offer more Sheep (higher value than Wheat) for Ore. Since Sheep is 16 value and Ore is 35, I can afford to give a better ratio. For example, 6 Sheep (96 value) for 2 Ore (70 value) is still positive for me (96-70=26 gain for Player 1, but 70-96=-26 loss is acceptable if it means consolidating to high-value resources).\n   - Alternatively, try to keep Brick offers minimal since I have very few Brick. Focus on Ore for now.\n\n5. **Best Offer**: \n   - Offer 6 Sheep (high-value resource for Player 1) for 2 Ore (critically valuable to me). This is a 96-for-70 value trade in Player 1\u2019s favor, increasing the chance of acceptance.\n\n[Offer: 6 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
