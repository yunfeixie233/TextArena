Could be bundled to sweeten trades.\n- **Wood:** 20 (11 total value) \u2013 highest quantity, but low value per unit. Prime candidate to trade away.\n- **Sheep:** 20 (18 total value) \u2013 high quantity, decent value. Can afford to trade some without hurting.\n- **Brick:** 13 (26 total value) \u2013 balanced quantity and high value. Want to accumulate more.\n- **Ore:** 17 (36 total value) \u2013 second-highest quantity, highest value per unit. Hold unless for big upgrades like brick.\n\n**Goal:** Maximize total value. Brick has the best value-to-quantity ratio (2 value per brick). Ore is already abundant. Wood and sheep are overrepresented.\n\n**Trading Strategy:**\n1. Trade away excess **wood** and **sheep** for **brick**.\n2. Dangle **wheat** as a sweetener since it's low-value but might be wanted for set completion.\n3. Avoid trading away **ore** or **brick** unless the return is exceptional.\n\n---\n\n### Negotiation Turn 1\n\n[You are Player 0. Current market prices (known to both players but not explicitly stated here) imply Brick is in demand. You\u2019ll target Brick from Player 1, offering Wood and Sheep (your most excess) and possibly Wheat if needed.]\n\n**Opening Position:** You're rich in Wood and Sheep, need Brick. A fair offer would send ~2 value per brick.\n\n**Offer:** \n[Offer: 6 Wood, 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 5 Brick, 1 Wheat]  \n*Rationale:* You're sending 6(0.55) + 4(0.9) + 2(1) = 3.3 + 3.6 + 2 = 8.9 value for 5 brick (5*2=10) and getting back 1 wheat (1). Net: You gain ~2.1 value while giving a slight material surplus. Player 1 gets quantity but lower value density.",
