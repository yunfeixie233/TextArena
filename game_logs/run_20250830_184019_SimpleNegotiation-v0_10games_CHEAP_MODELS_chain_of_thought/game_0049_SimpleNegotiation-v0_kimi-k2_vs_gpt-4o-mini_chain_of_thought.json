Trade 4 (4 Sheep + 1 Wood \u2192 6 Ore) \u2013 accepted\n   Wheat 0, Wood 4, Sheep 3, Brick 12, Ore 18  \n\nCurrent totals (4 turns played, 6 remaining):\n\n   Wheat 0, Wood 4, Sheep 3, Brick 12, Ore 18\n\nValues that still help me:\n\n   Brick 29, Ore 39 \u2192 high-value targets to acquire.  \n   Wood 12 \u2192 acceptable to offer.  \n   Sheep 16 \u2192 still valuable to me, but I\u2019ll keep an eye on whether over-bidding Ore/Brick is worth it.\n\nNext move: I\u2019d like to keep acquiring Ore (which is almost as good as getting more Brick). I don\u2019t need Wheat any more and I have only 0 Wheat, so I can only trade away Sheep or Wood.  \nSince I have 3 Sheep and 4 Wood, I can spare a little more Sheep/Wood in exchange for Ore.\n\nProposed offer:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep \u2192 6 Ore]",
