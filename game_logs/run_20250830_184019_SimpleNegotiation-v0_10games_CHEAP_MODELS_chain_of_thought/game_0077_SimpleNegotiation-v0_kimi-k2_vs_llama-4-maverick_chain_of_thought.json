One way to do this is to offer resources of lower value in exchange for resources of higher value.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Possible Trades\nLet's consider offering Wheat (Value: 6) or Wood (Value: 9) for resources like Brick (Value: 20) or Ore (Value: 33), as they are of higher value.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a Counteroffer\nYou have Wheat and Wood that are of relatively lower value. Let's consider offering some Wheat or Wood for Ore, as Ore has the highest value.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on a Specific Counteroffer\nOffering Wheat for Ore could be a good strategy since Wheat is the lowest value resource you have, and Ore is the highest. For example, you could offer a quantity of Wheat in exchange for Ore.\n\nLet's calculate a potential trade:\n- You have 18 Wheat and 9 Ore.\n- Consider offering 4 Wheat for 1 Ore. This would result in:\n  - Loss: 4 Wheat = 4 * 6 = 24\n  - Gain: 1 Ore = 1 * 33 = 33\n  - Net change = 33 - 24 = 9\n\nThis trade is beneficial.\n\n## Step 6: Make the Counteroffer\nThe action for the counteroffer would be: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThe final answer is: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`",
