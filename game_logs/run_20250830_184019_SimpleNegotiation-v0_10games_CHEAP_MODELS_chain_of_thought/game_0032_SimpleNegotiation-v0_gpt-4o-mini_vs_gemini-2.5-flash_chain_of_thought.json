What if I offer Brick for Ore?\nValue of Brick is 27. Value of Ore is 38.\nSo 2 Brick (54) for 1 Ore (38) is good for Player 0, bad for me.\n3 Brick (81) for 2 Ore (76) is bad for me.\n\nLet's aim for a smaller trade that benefits me significantly, or break even.\n\nI have a lot of Brick. Maybe I can trade some Brick for Ore.\nIf I offer 1 Brick (27) for 1 Ore (38), it's excellent for me. Player 0 will likely reject this.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep and 1 Brick (17+27=44) for 1 Ore (38)? Still bad for me.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat (cheap).\nWhat if I offer 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (38)? This is good for me.\nWhat if I offer 3 Sheep (51) for 1 Ore (38)? This is bad for me.\n\nI need to get rid of my low-value items and gain high-value items.\nMy lowest value item is Wheat.\nOffer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore (Value: 5*6 = 30 vs. 1*38 = 38). Net gain of 8.
