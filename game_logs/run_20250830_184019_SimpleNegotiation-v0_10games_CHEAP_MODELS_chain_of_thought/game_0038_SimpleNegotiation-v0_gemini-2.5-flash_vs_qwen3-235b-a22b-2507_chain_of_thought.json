      "response": "Okay, I understand the game and my role. I've noted my current resources and their values, and I'm ready to strategize for maximum value. I will also be mindful of the 10-turn limit.\n\nHere's my analysis of the past moves:\n*   **Turn 1 (P0 offered 5 Brick -> 1 Ore, P1 Accepted):**\n    *   My resources changed: -5 Brick, +1 Ore.\n    *   Value change: -(5 * 23) + (1 * 35) = -115 + 35 = -80. This was a net loss in value. This was likely a mistake based on value, indicating I need to be more careful with future offers, or perhaps I had an abundance of brick and wanted to diversify for future trades.\n*   **Turn 2 (P0 offered 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore, P1 Rejected):**\n    *   My proposed value change: -(10 * 5) + (1 * 35) = -50 + 35 = -15. Still a loss. P1 correctly rejected or didn't like the terms.\n*   **Turn 3 (P0 offered 16 Wood -> 2 Ore, P1 Rejected):**\n    *   My proposed value change: -(16 * 12) + (2 * 35) = -192 + 70 = -122. Another significant loss. My pattern of offering less valuable items for more valuable items seems to be consistently undervaluing my offers from a *total value* perspective. I need to rethink my strategy.\n\nMy goal is to increase the *total value* of my resources. This means I should aim for trades where:\n(Value of Requested Resources) > (Value of Offered Resources)\n\nCurrent Resources:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 22 Value: 5 (Total Current Value: 110)\n*   [Wood] Qty: 16 Value: 12 (Total Current Value: 192)\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 21 Value: 14 (Total Current Value: 294)\n*   [Brick] Qty: 20 Value: 23 (Total Current Value: 460) - *Note: 25 - 5 = 20 after first trade*\n*   [Ore] Qty: 17 Value: 35 (Total Current Value: 595) - *Note: 16 + 1 = 17 after first trade*\n**Total Value: 110 + 192 + 294 + 460 + 595 = 1651**\n\nPrevious Total Value:\n(22*5) + (16*12) + (21*14) + (25*23) + (16*35) = 110 + 192 + 294 + 575 + 560 = 1731\n\nMy total value *decreased* by 80 in the first trade. I need to reverse this trend. My strategy should be to:\n1.  Offer lower-value items for higher-value items in a way that is mutually beneficial or at least beneficial to me.\n2.  Prioritize acquiring more Ore and Brick if I can get them at a good rate, as they have the highest per-unit value.\n3.  Be willing to part with Wheat or Wood if it leads to a net gain in value.\n\nLet's try to offer a quantity of low-value resources for a smaller quantity of high-value resources, ensuring a net positive value for me.\n\nI have a decent amount of Sheep and Brick. I also have a lot of Wheat.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nWhat if I offer a large amount of Wheat for some Ore?\nIf I offer 7 Wheat (7 * 5 = 35 value) for 1 Ore (1 * 35 = 35 value), that's break-even. I need to make it profitable for me.\n\nWhat if I offer 6 Wheat (6 * 5 = 30 value) for 1 Ore (35 value)? This is a gain of 5 for me. Player 1 might accept since 6 Wheat is a good quantity.\nOr maybe P1 has a lot of Ore and needs other resources.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
