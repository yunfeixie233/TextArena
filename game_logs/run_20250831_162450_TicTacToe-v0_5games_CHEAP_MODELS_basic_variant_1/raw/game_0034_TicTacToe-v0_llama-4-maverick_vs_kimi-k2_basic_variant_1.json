A good approach is to develop our position in a way that could lead to multiple possibilities for the next move.\n\nOne of the key strategies in Tic Tac Toe is to control the center and then expand. Since we already occupy the center with 'O', we should now look to create a potential line or block 'X' from doing so.\n\nLet's examine the available moves:\n- `[1]` and `[3]` are adjacent to 'X' and 'O' respectively, making them potential candidates for the next move as they continue the development.\n- `[2]` is a corner adjacent to `[1]`, and playing there could be a good developing move as it is not directly adjacent to 'X'.\n\nHowever, considering that 'X' has started by occupying a corner, a good response is to play in a position that is not directly next to 'X' but continues to develop our central control. \n\nOne strategic move is to occupy a corner that is not adjacent to 'X', or to continue the development by playing in a strategic position. \n\nLet's consider playing at `[2]`, a corner that is not directly next to 'X'. This is a relatively safe and developing move.\n\nSo, my move is: `[2]`\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [8]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] To determine the best move, let's analyze the current state of the board.\n\nThe current board is:\n```\n X | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n```\n\nAvailable moves are: `[2]`, `[3]`, `[5]`, `[6]`, `[7]`\n\nWe need to examine the available moves and decide on the best strategy. \n\nFirst, let's recall that we are playing as 'O'. We have occupied the center of the grid with 'O' in the previous move, which is a strategic position. \n\nNow, let's analyze the available moves:\n- `[2]` is a corner position and could be a good developing move as it helps in controlling the grid.\n- `[3]` is adjacent to our 'O' in the center, making it a potential candidate for the next move as it continues our development.\n- `[5]` is also adjacent to our 'O' in the center and could be a good move to develop our position further.\n- `[6]` and `[7]` are positions in the bottom row, which could be useful depending on the development of the game.\n\nGiven that 'X' has occupied two corners, we should focus on continuing our development while keeping an eye on 'X's potential next moves.\n\nLet's examine a potential threat: if 'X' gets to play in `[2]` or `[6]`, it could potentially create a strong line. However, we should also think about our own opportunities.\n\nPlaying at `[3]` or `[5]` would be a good move as it is adjacent to our central 'O', potentially setting up for a strong line or blocking 'X' from creating one.\n\nLet's consider the implications of playing at `[3]`:\n- If we play at `[3]`, the board would have 'X' in `[0]`, 'O' in `[1]`, 'O' in `[3]`, and 'O' in `[4]`. This could potentially lead to a strong position for 'O'.\n\nLet's choose `[3]`.\n\nSo, my move is: `[3]`\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] All three O\u2019s are already in a diagonal from top-right to center, so the only place that would complete an O-triple is the bottom-left corner [6].
