No win condition yet from this.\n\nLet's review the opponent's current winning threats with O at 4 and O at 8:\n1. Horizontal: To win horizontally, O needs 6 or 7. If O gets 6, they have O at 6, O at 8, and need 7. If O gets 7, they have O at 4, O at 8, and need 0 or 1.\n2. Vertical: To win vertically, O needs 2 or 5. If O gets 2, they have 2, 4, 8. No win. If O gets 5, they need 2, 5, 8. So if they play 2, they will win vertically.\n3. Diagonal: O already has 4 and 8. To win diagonally, O needs 0 (which I have) or 2.

If they had placed 'O' in 2 their win would be complete.\nThe current board is:\nX | 1 | 2\n---+---+---\n3 | O | 5\n---+---+---\n6 | 7 | O\n\nMy main threats are cells 2 and 6. If I play 2, I can attempt to make a diagonal link with my X. But the opponent already has O at 4 and 8, they will win if they get 2. My previous statement was incorrect: 0,4,8 is a diagonal. They don't have 2, they have O in 8. My X is in 0, O in 4, and O in 8. I have 0. They aim for 4 and 8. This is a common strategy by the opponent (O) to play corner and center. I have played 0. They could win by getting 2 or 6. If they get 2, they would win if I had 4 and they had 8, or if I had 0 and they had 4. It's confusing.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the board state:\nX at 0\nO at 4\nO at 8\n\nPossible winning lines for O:\nDiagonal: Cells (2,4,6) and (0,4,8)\nHorizontal: (3,4,5) and (6,7,8) and (0,1,2)\nVertical: (1,4,7) and (2,5,8) and (0,3,6)\n\nThe opponent currently has O at 4 and 8. If they get 0, they win. But I have 0. So that isn't a threat.\nIf they get 2, and I have 4, and they have 6, they win. But I have 0, they have 4 and 8.\nTheir (O) current path to victory is not yet apparent. I have 0, they have 4 and 8.\nIf they get 2, they have X (0), O (4), O (8), and O (2). No win condition yet from this.\n\nLet's review the opponent's current winning threats with O at 4 and O at 8:\n1. Horizontal: To win horizontally, O needs 6 or 7. If O gets 6, they have O at 6, O at 8, and need 7. If O gets 7, they have O at 4, O at 8, and need 0 or 1.\n2. Vertical: To win vertically, O needs 2 or 5. If O gets 2, they have 2, 4, 8. No win. If O gets 5, they need 2, 5, 8. So if they play 2, they will win vertically.\n3. Diagonal: O already has 4 and 8. To win diagonally, O needs 0 (which I have) or 2. So if O places at 2, they will create a line (2,4,8) and win.\n\nMy priority is to block the opponent's win condition at 2. Therefore, I will play 2.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [6]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  You are Player 1.

Blocked by O at 4.\n\nOpponent's winning lines:\n1. (0,3,6) - Opponent has O at 6. Need 0 (I have X) or 3. If O gets 3, they would have O at 3, O at 6, and need 0, which I have. So this line cannot be completed by O directly.\n2. (6,7,8) - Opponent has O at 6 and O at 8. If O gets 7, they win horizontally. This is a critical threat.\n3. (2,4,6) - Opponent has O at 4 and O at 6. If O gets 2 (I have X), they win. Blocked by my X.\n4. (1,4,7) - Opponent has O at 4. If O gets 1 and 7, they win.\n5. (0,4,8) - Opponent has O at 4 and O at 8. If O gets 0 (I have X), they win. Blocked by my X.\n\nThe most immediate threat is the opponent's ability to win by placing their symbol in cell 7, because they already have 'O' at cells 6 and 8.\nTo win, the opponent needs three consecutive 'O's.\nWith O at 6 and O at 8, playing 7 would give them (6,7,8) (Horizontal win).\nTherefore, I must block cell 7.\n\n[7]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]'",
