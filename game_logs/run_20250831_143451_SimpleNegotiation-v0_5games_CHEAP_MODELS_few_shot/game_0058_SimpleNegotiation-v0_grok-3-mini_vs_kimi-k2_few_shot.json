I correctly rejected all these since each was a losing trade for me.\n- My successful trade was 7 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick. That was smart: I gave 7*5 + 3*10 = 65 value to get 2*22 = 44 value? Wait, that seems like a loss... Hmm, but Brick is more scarce for me (I only had 3 before), so maybe it was worth it for strategic positioning. However, looking at pure value, that's -21, which isn't ideal. Maybe I miscalculated earlier.\n- My last offer (6 Wood \u2192 1 Ore) was rejected. That was actually a good offer: 6*10 = 60 vs 1*35 = 35. I was offering more value than receiving, so rejection makes sense.\n\nNow, Player 0 seems to need Ore badly (they keep offering undervalued trades for it). I have 17 Ore, which is a lot. Maybe I can sell some high, but I need to be careful not to give too much away.\n\nLooking at my resources, I have excess Wood (24) and Wheat (19), and decent Ore (17). Sheep is at 11, which is moderate. Brick at 5 is okay now.\n\nI should try to convert my excess low-value resources (Wheat/Wood) into higher-value ones (Ore/Sheep/Brick), but not give away Ore since it's my highest value.\n\nLet me try to offer some of my excess Wood for Sheep or Brick:\n\n[Offer: 6 Wood -> 2 Sheep]",

They offer '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' because 1 Ore (value 35) is worth more than 3 Wheat (value 12).\n\nExample 2: Player receives offer '2 Wood -> 4 Sheep'. They calculate: 2 Wood = 20 value, 4 Sheep = 60 value. Since they're giving less value than receiving, they respond '[Accept]'.\n\nExample 3: Player has excess low-value resources and offers '[Offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]' to convert multiple cheap resources into fewer valuable ones.\n\nUse the following special tokens for actions:\n  - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]': [Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\n  - '[Accept]': To accept an incoming offer.\n  - '[Deny]': To deny an incoming offer (default).\nThe game lasts for 10 turns in total.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 4 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 1 Brick -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 7 Wheat, 3 Wood -> Requested items: 2 Brick\n Player 0 accepted the trade offer from Player 1.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 6 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 6 Wood -> Requested items: 2 Sheep",
