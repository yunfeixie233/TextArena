Unfortunately, Wheat has the lowest value per unit, so I\u2019d like to trade my small amount of Wheat plus something else for a higher-value resource rather than trying to restore Wheat quantity.\n\nLatest feedback showed my earlier Brick-for-Ore-plus-Sheep offer was rejected, suggesting my partner prefers to keep Ore. I should try a smaller, more balanced exchange that still gives me a gain.\n\nOne good option: trade 2 Wheat and 2 Wood (total value 2\u00d75 + 2\u00d78 = 26) for 1 Ore (value 33). That nets me +7 value.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
