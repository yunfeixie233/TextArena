If players see the value of Ore over Sheep, they might accept. \n\nAlternatively, you might decide to offer lower value resources to acquire higher value resources based on your resource overages. \n\nAnother strong offer could be:\n\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]'\n\nHere, you are trading 10 Wheat (60) and 2 Wood (24) for 3 Brick (66). You're trading away a total of 84 for 66, which isn\u2019t beneficial. \n\nInstead, a more appealing offer might be:\n\n'[Offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]' \n\nWhere you turn multiple lower-value resources into more valuable Brick, or you could also consider converting some Paper or other valuable resources if the trading market presents those.\n\nHowever, without current offers from other players, I would recommend focusing on converting excess resources, particularly from that lighter Wheat and Wood line, to see if any support may trade at a premium.\n\nLet's keep our offers strategic but as immediate responses as possible based on offers received! \n\nWhat would you like to do first? Would you like to send out a specific offer? If so, please provide your desired offer details!",

They offer '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' because 1 Ore (value 35) is worth more than 3 Wheat (value 12).\n\nExample 2: Player receives offer '2 Wood -> 4 Sheep'. They calculate: 2 Wood = 20 value, 4 Sheep = 60 value. Since they're giving less value than receiving, they respond '[Accept]'.\n\nExample 3: Player has excess low-value resources and offers '[Offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]' to convert multiple cheap resources into fewer valuable ones.\n\nUse the following special tokens for actions:\n  - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]': [Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\n  - '[Accept]': To accept an incoming offer.\n  - '[Deny]': To deny an incoming offer (default).\nThe game lasts for 10 turns in total.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 5 Sheep -> Requested items: 2 Ore\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 10 Sheep -> Requested items: 2 Ore\n Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 0 accepted the trade offer from Player 1.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore",
      "response": "To evaluate Player 1's latest offer (3 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Ore), let's analyze the values:\n\n- **Value of Offered Resources**:\n  - 3 Wheat: 3 * 6 = 18\n  - 1 Wood: 1 * 12 = 12\n  - Total value of offered resources: 18 + 12 = 30\n\n- **Value of Requested Resource**:\n  - 1 Ore: 39\n\nIn this case, Player 0 would be giving 30 value to receive 39 value. Since the value received is greater than the value given, this trade is beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I will respond with:\n\n'[Accept]'",
