Currently, your most valuable resource is **Wheat** (20), followed by **Brick** (26) and **Ore** (14). \n\nNext, you should look for opportunities to trade less valuable resources for more valuable ones or to consolidate your resources. \n\nHere\u2019s a strategic offer to maximize value:\n- You have a lot of Wheat and may want to convert some of it into a more valuable resource like Ore or Brick. Since you have excess Wheat and need to increase your resource value, consider offering some Wheat in exchange for Ore.\n\n**Next Offer:** \n- Offer 8 Wheat for 2 Ore.\n  \nPlease confirm your trading action or suggest a different one!",
