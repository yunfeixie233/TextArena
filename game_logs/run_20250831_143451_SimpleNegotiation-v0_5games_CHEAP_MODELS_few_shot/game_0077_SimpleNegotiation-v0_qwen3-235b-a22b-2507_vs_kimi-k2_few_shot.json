      "observation": "\n You are Player 0 in the Negotiation Game.\nYour task is to trade such that the total value of your resources increases.\nThe resources and associated values you currently have are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 13   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 7    Value: 12\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 9    Value: 18\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 17   Value: 30\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 7    Value: 38\n\nHere are some examples of good trading decisions:\n\nExample 1: A player has 5 Wheat (value 4 each) and sees opponent needs Wheat. They offer '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' because 1 Ore (value 35) is worth more than 3 Wheat (value 12).\n\nExample 2: Player receives offer '2 Wood -> 4 Sheep'. They calculate: 2 Wood = 20 value, 4 Sheep = 60 value. Since they're giving less value than receiving, they respond '[Accept]'.\n\nExample 3: Player has excess low-value resources and offers '[Offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]' to convert multiple cheap resources into fewer valuable ones.\n\nUse the following special tokens for actions:\n  - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]': [Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\n  - '[Accept]': To accept an incoming offer.\n  - '[Deny]': To deny an incoming offer (default).\nThe game lasts for 10 turns in total.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 5 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Brick\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 5 Wheat, 2 Brick -> Requested items: 2 Ore, 1 Brick\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 7 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 0 accepted the trade offer from Player 1.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 8 Wheat -> Requested items: 2 Ore\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 6 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore",
