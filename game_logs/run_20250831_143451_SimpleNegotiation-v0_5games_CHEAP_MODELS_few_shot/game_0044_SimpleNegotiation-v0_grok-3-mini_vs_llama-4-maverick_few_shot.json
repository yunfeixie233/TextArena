However, without knowing Player 0's resources, we can only speculate based on the values.\n\nGiven the current resources and values, an example offer could be:\n- Offering resources like Wheat and/or Wood for Ore, Brick, or Sheep, if we can negotiate a good rate.\n\nLet's consider making an offer:\n- We have plenty of Wheat and Wood. Let's offer some for a more valuable resource. For instance, '[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]'.\n\nValue given: (4 Wheat * 6) + (2 Wood * 9) = 24 + 18 = 42\nValue received: 1 Brick * 26 = 26\n\nThis offer is not good because we're giving more value than we're getting.\n\nLet's think about another offer:\n- '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'\n\nValue given: 5 Wheat * 6 = 30\nValue received: 1 Sheep * 15 = 15\n\nThis is also not beneficial.\n\nLet's consider a more valuable exchange:\n- '[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]'\n\nValue given: 2 Wood * 9 = 18\nValue received: 1 Brick * 26 = 26\n\nThis is a potentially good offer since we're receiving more value than we're giving.\n\nThus, my action is: \n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]",

They offer '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' because 1 Ore (value 35) is worth more than 3 Wheat (value 12).\n\nExample 2: Player receives offer '2 Wood -> 4 Sheep'. They calculate: 2 Wood = 20 value, 4 Sheep = 60 value. Since they're giving less value than receiving, they respond '[Accept]'.\n\nExample 3: Player has excess low-value resources and offers '[Offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]' to convert multiple cheap resources into fewer valuable ones.\n\nUse the following special tokens for actions:\n  - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]': [Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\n  - '[Accept]': To accept an incoming offer.\n  - '[Deny]': To deny an incoming offer (default).\nThe game lasts for 10 turns in total.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 4 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 1 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Brick",
