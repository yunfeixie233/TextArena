      "response": "Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore -> Requested items: 20 Wood, 12 Wheat\nMy current resources and their values are:\n[Wheat] Qty: 12 Value: 5 (Total Value: 60)\n[Wood] Qty: 22 Value: 11 (Total Value: 242)\n[Sheep] Qty: 7 Value: 13 (Total Value: 91)\n[Brick] Qty: 23 Value: 22 (Total Value: 506)\n[Ore] Qty: 20 Value: 32 (Total Value: 640)\n\nThe offer from Player 0 is:\nOffered items: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore\nRequested items: 20 Wood, 12 Wheat\n\nLet's calculate the value of the offered items:\n2 Sheep * 13 = 26\n1 Ore * 32 = 32\nTotal \"offered to me\" value = 26 + 32 = 58\n\nNow let's calculate the value of items Player 0 is requesting from me:\n20 Wood * 11 = 220\n12 Wheat * 5 = 60\nTotal \"requested from me\" value = 220 + 60 = 280\n\nSince the value I would be giving up (280) is significantly higher than the value I would be receiving (58), I should **Deny** this offer.\n\nNext, I need to make an offer. I have a lot of Brick and Ore, which are high-value resources. Wheat and Sheep are lower value. I want to increase my total value. Perhaps I can trade some of my high-value Brick for more high-value Ore or consolidate some lower-value resources.\n\nLet's try to trade Brick for Ore. I have 23 Brick (value 22) and 20 Ore (value 32).\nIf I offer 3 Brick (3 * 22 = 66) for 2 Ore (2 * 32 = 64), it's close to even, but slightly favorable for me. I can offer a slightly less favorable trade for the opponent if I want to increase my overall value, for instance, 3 Brick for 1 Ore and something else small, or ask for slightly more Ore for my Brick.\n\nHow about I offer Brick to get more Ore, since Ore has a higher per-unit value.\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore] This is 66 value going out for 64 value coming in. This doesn't increase my total value much, and might be rejected.\n\nLet's look at my lower value items. I have 12 Wheat (value 5) and 7 Sheep (value 13).\nI have a good amount of Wood.\n\nI could try to convert some Sheep and Wheat into something more valuable like Brick or Ore.\nLet's offer: 5 Wheat (value 25) + 3 Sheep (value 39) = 64 total value.\nI could ask for 2 Brick (value 44) or 2 Ore (value 64). Or 1 Ore and 1 Sheep.\n\nLet's make an offer that is clearly beneficial for me concerning specific resources. I have a lot of Wood. I could try to convert some Wood into Ore.\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nMy 3 Wood = 3 * 11 = 33 value.\nTheir 1 Ore = 1 * 32 = 32 value.\nThis is a nearly even trade, but it might get accepted. It doesn't significantly increase my overall value.\n\nWhat if I aim for a profit on Brick? I have 23 Brick.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, as it's the highest value resource.\nI will offer a few Sheep and Wheat for an Ore from Player 0.\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue I offer: (4 * 13) + (2 * 5) = 52 + 10 = 62.\nValue I request: (1 * 32) = 32.\nThis is clearly bad for me, I want to gain value.\n\nLet me try to trade my surplus of Brick into more valuable resources.\n\nLet's consider trading some of my Brick for their Ore. Given that Brick is 22 and Ore is 32.\nIf I give 3 Brick (66 value), I would want to get at least 2 Ore (64 value). That's a good trade for them.\nI want to gain value. So I need to offer less value than I receive.\n\nLet's try a strategic trade. I have a lot of Brick.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nValue I offer: 2 * 22 = 44.\nValue I request: 1 * 32 = 32.\nThis is a bad trade for me since I'm giving more value than I'm getting. I should not do this.\n\nI must make a trade that increases my total value.\n\nI have 12 Wheat and 7 Sheep, which are my lowest value resources per unit.\nI could try converting several of these low-value goods into one higher-value good.\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\nValue of Offer: (6 * 5) + (3 * 13) = 30 + 39 = 69\nValue of Request: (2 * 22) = 44\nThis is giving up 69 value for 44 value, so this is bad for me.\n\nLet's try:\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Brick]\nValue of Offer: (4 * 13) + (2 * 5) = 52 + 10 = 62\nValue of Request: (2 * 22) = 44\nThis is still bad for me.\n\nMy goal is to increase the value of my resources.\n\nI have a lot of Wood and Brick. Wood is 11, Brick is 22. My Wheat is 5 and Sheep is 13.\nI could try to get an Ore (value 32) by offering some of my lower-value resources.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (3 * 13) + (3 * 5) = 39 + 15 = 54\nValue requested: 1 * 32 = 32\nStill giving more value than I get. I want the requested items to be worth MORE than the offered items.\n\nLet's revise the thought process: I want to receive items whose total value is *higher* than the total value of items I give away.\n\nHow about converting some Brick into Ore, but on my terms?\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]\nValue I offer: 3 * 22 = 66\nValue I request: 2 * 32 = 64\nThis is almost even, technically a very slight loss for me. Not good.\n\nLet's try targeting resources I might have less of, and gaining specific advantages.\nI have plenty of Wood (22).\nWhat if I trade some Wood for Brick?\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]\nValue offered: 3 * 11 = 33\nValue requested: 2 * 22 = 44\nThis is favorable to me! I give 33 value and receive 44 value. This increases my total resource value by 11.\n\nOkay, I like this plan. I will first respond to Player 0's offer, then make my own.\n\n**Player 0's Offer Analysis:**\nOffered: 2 Sheep (2*13=26) + 1 Ore (1*32=32) = 58\nRequested: 20 Wood (20*11=220) + 12 Wheat (12*5=60) = 280\nValue I lose: 280. Value I gain: 58.\nThis is a very poor offer for me.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]",
