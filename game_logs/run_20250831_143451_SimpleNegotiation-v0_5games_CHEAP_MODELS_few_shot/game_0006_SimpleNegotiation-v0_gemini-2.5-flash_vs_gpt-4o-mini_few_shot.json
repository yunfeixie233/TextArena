This was a bad proposal, I was offering too much.\nMy goal is to increase my total value. Ore and Brick are my most valuable resources. Sheep and Wheat are currently the lowest value resources I have. I have a lot of Brick and Ore, and a moderate amount of Wood, but very little Sheep and Wheat. I should try to trade my lower value resources for higher value ones.\n\nI want to acquire more Ore or Brick. I will try to offer a more reasonable amount of Sheep, as I have limited quantities left. I could try to trade Wood, as I still have 9 units.\n\nLet's evaluate my options for trading for 1 Ore (value 33):\n- 3 Wood: 3 * 12 = 36. This is a reasonable trade for me, value 36 for value 33.\n- (I don't have enough Sheep or Wheat to trade a good quantity for 1 Ore without giving up too much value.)\n\nLet's evaluate my options for trading for 1 Brick (value 30):\n- 2 Wood: 2 * 12 = 24. This is a good trade for me, value 24 for value 30.\n- 6 Wheat: 6 * 5 = 30. This is a fair trade.\n\nSince I have more Wood than Sheep or Wheat, and Wood has a decent value, I will try to trade Wood for a high value resource.\n\nI will try to get 1 Ore again, but offer 3 Wood, which is a closer value.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
