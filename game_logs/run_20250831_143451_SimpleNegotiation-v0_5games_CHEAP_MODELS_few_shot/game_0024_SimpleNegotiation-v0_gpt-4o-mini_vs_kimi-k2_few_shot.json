Here are some strategic options based on your resources:\n\n1. You have a significant amount of Wheat which is relatively low in value compared to others. This could be converted into more valuable resources. \n\n2. Offering some combination of Wheat and Wood or Sheep for higher-value resources could be a good strategy since they are in excess.\n\n3. You could also consider doing a trade that returns key resources like Brick or Ore which have a high value.\n\n### Example Trade Offers\n\n**Offer 1:** \n- You could offer a combination of Wheat for Brick or Ore, such as: \n  `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n  \nThis trades 5 Wheat (value 25) for 1 Brick (value 25), which is effectively a neutral trade.\n\n**Offer 2:**\n- Offer a better trade by proposing:\n  `[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Brick]`\n  \nThis trades 8 Wheat (value 40) for 2 Brick (value 50), increasing your total value by 10.\n\n**Offer 3:**\n- If someone is looking for low-value resources, you could say: \n  `[Offer: 6 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n  \nWhere you are turning lower-value resources into one high-value resource.\n\n### Conclusion:\nI will make a favorable trade offer to increase the total value of my resources in the negotiation game.\n\n**Suggested Action:** \n`[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Brick]`",

Since Player 1 has not made any offers, I need to assess how I can optimize my resources.\n\nI notice a surplus of Wheat and Wood. To get more valuable items, I should consider converting some of these lower-value items into something more valuable. \n\nA good strategy would be to offer:\n\n**Proposed Offer**: \n- **Offer**: 4 Wheat, 4 Wood -> **Request**: 1 Ore\n\nThis is because:\n\n- The total value of 4 Wheat (4 * 5) = 20\n- The total value of 4 Wood (4 * 12) = 48\n- **Total Offered Value = 20 + 48 = 68**\n\n- The total value of receiving 1 Ore (value 37) is less than what I'll be giving away, but it helps to normalize my resource spread as the Ore is a high-value resource even if the trade value comparison is slightly skewed.\n\nTherefore, my trade decision would be:\n\n**[Offer: 4 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]**",
