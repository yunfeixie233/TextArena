I can propose the following:\n\n**Offer:**\n'[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n\nValues:\n- 5 Sheep = 5 * 12 = 60\n- 2 Wheat = 2 * 5 = 10\n- Total value given = 70\n\nIn exchange for:\n- 1 Ore = 39\n\nThis offer seems unfavorable as I\u2019m giving away resources worth 70 for something worth only 39, which is not ideal. \n\n### Revised Offer:\nInstead of that, I could focus on converting some lower-value resources into something better, like Brick, which has a high value. \n\n**New Offer:**\n'[Offer: 8 Wool, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]' \n\nValues:\n- 8 Wheat = 40\n- 3 Wood = 30\nTotal = 70\n\nIn exchange for:\n- 2 Brick = 48\n\nThat\u2019s still not favorable.\n\n### Final Offer:\nHaving considered all options, it makes sense to offer something more reasonable with the ultimate goal of trying to improve my total value.\n\nSo I will go with another offer:\n\n'[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]'\n\nValues:\n- 3 Wheat = 15\n- 2 Wood = 20\nTotal = 35\n\nIn exchange for:\n- 1 Brick = 24\n\nThis trade offers a net value increase!

I have an excess of Wood and Brick, and I can look for trades that involve converting some of these potentially lower-value resources into something more valuable.\n2. I might offer a larger package for a higher quantity of Ore or other valuable resources.\n\n**Possible Trade Offer:**\n- Offer: 8 Wood, 2 Sheep -> Request: 2 Ore\n  - This would offer a total value of 80 + 24 = 104 for 2 Ore (value 78), which is worth more, so this would be beneficial.\n\nLet's proceed with this trade offer:\n\n'[Offer: 8 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]'",
