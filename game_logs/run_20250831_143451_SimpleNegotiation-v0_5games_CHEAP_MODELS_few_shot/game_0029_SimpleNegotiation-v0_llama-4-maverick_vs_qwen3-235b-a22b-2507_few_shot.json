      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0, I begin by analyzing my current resources and their values:\n\n- Wheat: Qty = 14, Value = 6\n- Wood: Qty = 25, Value = 9\n- Sheep: Qty = 22, Value = 16\n- Brick: Qty = 21, Value = 22\n- Ore: Qty = 15, Value = 36\n\nMy total value is calculated as follows:\n- Total Value = (14*6) + (25*9) + (22*16) + (21*22) + (15*36)\n- Total Value = 84 + 225 + 352 + 462 + 540\n- Total Value = 1663\n\nTo increase my total value, I need to either receive resources of higher value than what I offer or optimize my resource distribution to be more valuable.\n\n### Initial Strategy\n\n1. **Identify Overvalued and Undervalued Resources**: I have resources with varying values. Ore is my most valuable resource (Value = 36), and Wheat is one of the least valuable (Value = 6).\n\n2. **Trade Strategy**: I will look to trade my less valuable resources for more valuable ones or maintain a balance that increases my total value.\n\n### Turn 1 Action\n\nGiven that I have a good quantity of all resources, my initial strategy is to look for opportunities to trade less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nUpon examining my resources, I notice that I can potentially trade some of my Wheat or Wood for other resources that might be more valuable. However, without knowing the offers from other players or their needs, I'll start by making an offer that attempts to exchange less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nI decide to offer some of my Wheat and Wood for Brick or Ore, as they are more valuable. Here's a potential trade:\n\n- I have 14 Wheat (Value = 6 each) and 25 Wood (Value = 9 each).\n- I can offer 4 Wheat (Value = 24) and 2 Wood (Value = 18) for 1 Ore (Value = 36).\n\nTotal value given = (4*6) + (2*9) = 24 + 18 = 42\nTotal value received = 1*36 = 36\n\nThis trade is not favorable as I'm giving more value than I'm receiving. Let's adjust the strategy.\n\n### Alternative Trade\n\nLet's consider an alternative trade that involves offering less valuable resources for a more valuable one:\n\n- Offer: 5 Wheat (Value = 30) -> 1 Brick (Value = 22) is not favorable.\n- A more balanced trade could be: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick\n\nTotal value given = (2*6) + (1*9) = 12 + 9 = 21\nTotal value received = 1*22 = 22\n\nThis is a slightly favorable trade as I'm receiving a resource worth 22 for resources worth 21.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\nI will make an offer: `[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis action is aimed at slightly increasing my total value by trading less valuable resources for a more valuable one.\n\n### Response to Potential Incoming Offers\n\nIf there's an incoming offer, I will analyze it based on the value exchange. If the offer is favorable (i.e., I receive more value than I give), I will respond with `[Accept]`. Otherwise, I will respond with `[Deny]` unless it's extremely beneficial, in which case I'll still consider accepting.\n\nLet's proceed with the action for Turn 1.\n\n`[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]`",

Player 1 rejected.\n- Player 0 offered 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick to Player 1. Player 1 rejected.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Rejected Offers\n- First rejected offer: 2 Wheat (Value: 12), 1 Wood (Value: 9) -> 1 Brick (Value: 22). Total offered value = 21, Requested value = 22. The offer was slightly unfavorable in terms of value.\n- Second rejected offer: 3 Wheat (Value: 18) -> 1 Brick (Value: 22). Total offered value = 18, Requested value = 22. This offer was also unfavorable but closer.\n\n### Step 4: Determine a New Trading Strategy\nGiven that the previous offers were rejected, it's essential to either make a more attractive offer or consider the current resources and think about what would be a beneficial trade.\n\n### Step 5: Assess Potential Trades\n1. **Calculate the value of resources**: We have a good amount of lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood) and some higher-value resources (Sheep, Brick, Ore).\n2. **Identify potential trades**: We need to convert lower-value resources into higher-value ones or maintain our current valuable resources.\n\n### Step 6: Formulate a New Offer\nLet's consider offering a mix of lower-value resources for a higher-value one. For example, offering Wheat and/or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\n### Step 7: Propose a Trade\nGiven that Player 1 rejected offers involving Wheat for Brick, let's try a different combination that might be more appealing. \n\n- Offering: 4 Wood (Value: 36) -> 1 Ore (Value: 36). This is a fair trade in terms of value.\n- The action for this trade would be: `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]`.\n\n### Step 8: Execute the Action\nSince we've formulated a potential trade, let's execute it.\n\nThe final answer is: `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]`",

      "response": "### Turn Analysis and Decision Making\n\n#### Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: Qty = 12 (14 - 2), Value = 6\n- Wood: Qty = 21 (25 - 4), Value = 9\n- Sheep: Qty = 22, Value = 16\n- Brick: Qty = 22 (21 + 1), Value = 22\n- Ore: Qty = 14 (15 - 1), Value = 36\n\n#### Previous Actions and Outcomes:\n1. Offered 2 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Brick (Rejected)\n2. Offered 3 Wheat for 1 Brick (Rejected)\n3. Offered 4 Wood for 1 Ore (Accepted)\n\n#### Current State:\nAfter the last turn, the current state is:\n- We have given away 4 Wood and 3 Wheat and received 1 Ore and 1 Brick.\n\n#### Evaluating the Situation:\n1. **Resources Given Away:**\n   - 3 Wheat = 3 * 6 = 18 value\n   - 4 Wood = 4 * 9 = 36 value\n   - Total given away = 18 + 36 = 54 value\n\n2. **Resources Received:**\n   - 1 Ore = 1 * 36 = 36 value\n   - 1 Brick = 1 * 22 = 22 value\n   - Total received = 36 + 22 = 58 value\n\nThe last trade was beneficial as we received more value than we gave away (58 > 54).\n\n#### New Offer Decision:\nTo increase the total value of our resources, we need to think about what we can offer and what we can gain.\n\n1. **Identify Low-Value and High-Value Resources:**\n   - Low-value resources we have: Wheat (Value = 6), Wood (Value = 9)\n   - High-value resources we need: Ore (Value = 36), Brick (Value = 22)\n\n2. **Possible Trades:**\n   - We can offer Wheat or Wood (or a combination) for Brick or Ore.\n\n3. **Formulating a New Offer:**\n   - We have already tried offering Wheat for Brick and were rejected multiple times. Let's consider offering Sheep, which is more valuable than Wheat or Wood but still relatively lower than Ore or Brick.\n\nLet's offer 2 Sheep for 1 Ore.\n\n#### Value Calculation:\n- 2 Sheep = 2 * 16 = 32 value\n- 1 Ore = 1 * 36 = 36 value\n\nSince 36 > 32, this trade is beneficial.\n\n#### Action:\n`[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis action follows the required format and aims to increase the total value of our resources.",
