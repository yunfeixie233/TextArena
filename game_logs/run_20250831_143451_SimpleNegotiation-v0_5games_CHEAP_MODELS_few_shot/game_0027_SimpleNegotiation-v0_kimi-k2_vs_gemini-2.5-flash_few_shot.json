Accepting this offer would decrease your total value. Thus, you should deny this offer.\nLet's consider a counter offer.\nPlayer 0 seems to want Brick and is willing to give Wheat. However, their last offer was not good.\nThey offered (6 Wheat -> 2 Brick) and I rejected (9 Wheat -> 2 Brick) as well.\nThis means they value my Brick at least something close to 2 Brick.\nI have a lot of Wheat (21). It's my lowest value resource.\nI want more high value resources. Brick is good (value 25), but Ore (35) is better, and Sheep (18) and Wood (10) are worse.\n\nI can try to get more than 2 Brick for the same amount of Wheat, or offer less Wheat for 2 Brick.\nMy previous implicit rejection was that 9 Wheat for 2 Brick was too much Wheat to give up.\nValue wise: 9 Wheat = 54. 2 Brick = 50. I'd lose 4.\nValue wise: 6 Wheat = 36. 2 Brick = 50. I'd lose 14.\n\nThey are trying to get resources from me at a lower value.\nWhat if I offer a better deal for me?\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (value 18) for 1 Brick (value 25), that's a gain of 7.\nIf I offer 4 Wheat (value 24) for 1 Brick (value 25), that's a gain of 1.\nSince I have a lot of Wheat, I can be a bit more aggressive on the exchange rate.\n\nMaybe they want more than 1 Brick.\nWhat if I offer 9 Wheat for 3 Brick?\nMy 9 Wheat = 54 value. Their 3 Brick = 75 value. This is a gain of 21 for me. This is good!\nIt also requires Player 0 to have 3 Brick.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nCan I offer a lot of low-value stuff for high-value stuff?\nOffer: 10 Wheat (value 60) for 2 Ore (value 70). Gain 10. This is good.\nIf Player 0 asks for Brick, they might have more Ore.\n\nConsider current proposal: 6 Wheat -> 2 Brick.\nValue of 6 Wheat = 36. Value of 2 Brick = 50. Net gain for Player 0 = 14.\nThis is a bad offer for me. I should always deny offers that reduce my net value.\n\nLet's offer something that clearly benefits me.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wheat for a high-value item like Ore?\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nMy 10 Wheat = 60. Their 1 Ore = 35. This is bad for me. I want gain, not lose. I want to trade low value for high value, not equal to or lower.\n\nLet's rethink. I have a lot of Wheat (21), Wood (16), Sheep (19).\nI have less Ore (10). Brick is also good (17).\nMy goals are:\n1. Increase total value.\n2. Convert less valuable resources into more valuable resources.\n\nTarget resources: Ore (35), Brick (25).\nSource resources: Wheat (6), Wood (10), Sheep (18).\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat for Brick or Ore.\nIf I give 3 Wheat (18) for 1 Brick (25) -> Gain of 7.\nIf I give 4 Wheat (24) for 1 Brick (25) -> Gain of 1.\nLet's try: [Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nThis is a gain of 1. It's a small gain, but if they accept, it's better than nothing and reduces my high Wheat count.\n\nWhat about trading Wheat for Ore?\nHow many Wheat for 1 Ore (35)?\nIf I give 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (35) -> Gain of 5.\nIf I give 6 Wheat (36) for 1 Ore (35) -> Loss of 1.\nSo, 5 Wheat for 1 Ore seems reasonable.\nThis would be: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nI'll try to get Brick first, as Player 0 has expressed interest in it, so they are more likely to have excess.\nMy last rejection was 9 Wheat -> 2 Brick. Value: (54 -> 50). It was a loss of 4 for me.\nThe current offer is 6 Wheat -> 2 Brick. Value: (36 -> 50). It is a loss of 14 for me.\n\nPlayer 0 wants Brick. I have 17 Brick. It is my second highest value. I don't want to give it up cheaply.\nI will deny Player 0's offer because it decreases my value.\n\nThen I will make my own offer. Since Player 0 offered Wheat for Brick, they seem to have Wheat and want Brick.\nI have a lot of Wheat (21) and want to get rid of it for high value resources.\nLet's offer a slightly better deal for them for Brick, but still in my favor.\nMy previous offer to them was implied rejection of (9 Wheat -> 2 Brick), so I don't want to offer 9 Wheat for 2 Brick again.\n\nLet's try to get just 1 Brick first, testing the waters.\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nMy value: 4 * 6 = 24.\nRequested value: 1 * 25 = 25.\nNet change: +1. It's a small gain, but it's a gain, and I have a lot of Wheat.\n\nI will first reject the current offer.\n\nThen I will offer something. I have a lot of Wheat, and I want Brick or Ore.\nPlayer 0 has offered Wheat for Brick. So they might have a lot of Wheat and want Brick.\nIf I offer my Wheat for their Brick, I need to make sure the trade is profitable for me.\nMy resources:\nWheat: 21 (Value 6)\nWood: 16 (Value 10)\nSheep: 19 (Value 18)\nBrick: 17 (Value 25)\nOre: 10 (Value 35)\n\nI need to convert low value (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) into high value (Brick, Ore).\nLet's make an offer that results in a net gain for me from the perspective of value.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Brick]\nMy 8 Wheat = 48 value.\nTheir 2 Brick = 50 value.\nNet gain for me is 2. This is a very small gain. Is it too small for them to accept?\nThe last offer from Player 0 was 6 Wheat for 2 Brick. (36 -> 50) which was a loss of 14 for me.\nIf Player 0 accepts 8 Wheat for 2 Brick, they are losing 2.\nPlayer 0 is less likely to accept this, as they are losing value.\n\nI should make an offer that is beneficial for me, but not so bad for the opponent that they deny it outright.\nThey seem willing to give up Wheat for Brick.\nWhat if I combine different low-value resources for a high-value one?\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]?\n3 Wheat = 18. 2 Wood = 20. Total 38. For 1 Ore = 35. This is a loss of 3 for me. Bad.\n\nI need Player 0 to accept my offer for me to gain value.\nThey want Brick. I want to trade Wheat for Brick.\nValue of 1 Brick = 25.\nHow much Wheat is 25 value? 25 / 6 = 4.16. So I need to offer 4 Wheat for a tiny gain, or 3 Wheat for a significant gain.\nIf I offer [Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]:\nMy 3 Wheat = 18. Their 1 Brick = 25. Net gain = 7.\nThis is a good offer for me. It's a significant gain.\nPlayer 0 would lose 7 value if they accept this. (They give 1 Brick (25) and get 3 Wheat (18)). They would be losing 7 value.\nWhy would they accept? They might have excess Brick, or need Wheat for something.\n\nLet's try to offer something that is beneficial for both of us (positive sum thinking), or at least slightly beneficial for them.\nPlayer 0 offered 6 Wheat -> 2 Brick (Loss of 14 for me, Gain of 14 for them).\nI rejected 9 Wheat -> 2 Brick (Loss of 4 for me, Gain of 4 for them).\n\nLet's try to steal some Sheep or Wood from them if they have low value. I have a lot of Sheep and Wood too.\nI need to get Ore or Brick.\n\nI'll reject their current offer.\nThen I will re-offer something with Wheat for Brick, possibly better for me.\nI will try to make an offer that is slightly less bad for them than their own offer was for me.\nTheir offer: 6 Wheat (36) -> 2 Brick (50). P0 gain 14. P1 loss 14.\nMy target: Gain value. I want P1 gain.\nI should make an offer where P1 gains and P0 loses (but not too much), or where both gain (if possible).\n\nHow about: [Offer: 7 Wheat -> 2 Brick]\nMy 7 Wheat = 42. Their 2 Brick = 50. Net gain for me is 8.\nFor Player 0, they give 2 Brick (50) and get 7 Wheat (42). Net loss for them is 8.\nThis is still a loss for them, but less of a loss than the 14 value I would lose if I accepted their previous offer.\nIt's a gain of 8 for me, which is good.\nI have plenty of Wheat (21). Giving 7 is fine. I have 17 Brick, so giving two is fine.\n\nI will try this.\n\n```json\n[Deny]\n```\n```json\n[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 2 Brick]\n```",
