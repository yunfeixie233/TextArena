Player 1 offered: 8 Wheat (48 value) and 5 Wood (40 value) for 2 Brick (40 value).\n   - Total value of items offered: 48 + 40 = 88\n   - Value of items requested: 2 Brick = 40 value\n\n**Decision**: \nSince Player 0's resources have a higher total value when giving up 88 comparing to receiving 40, Player 0 replies with '[Deny]' because Player 0 will lose value.\n\n### Planned Next Action:\nIf no further offers are made by Player 1, Player 0 has to come up with a new trade offer to not only maintain but also try to increase their total resource value. \n\nSince Player 1 has not made any other offers and there are no valuable proposals currently, I will wait for Player 1's next move. \n\nFor now, my decision is:\n```\n[Deny]\n```",

      "response": "Let's analyze the situation after the trade actions to make a strategic decision for future trades.\n\n**Current Resources:**\n- After trading with Player 1 (offering 5 Wheat and 6 Wood for 1 Ore), Player 0 now has:\n    - Wheat: 18 - 5 = 13\n    - Wood: 11 - 6 = 5\n    - Sheep: 7\n    - Brick: 0\n    - Ore: 0 + 1 = 1\n\nPlayer 1's last offer of 8 Wheat and 5 Wood for 2 Brick was rejected by Player 0. However, let's evaluate it for our next move.\n\n**Evaluating Player 1's Offer:**\n- Received Offer: 8 Wheat (value 48) + 5 Wood (value 40) = 88 total value\n- Requested: 2 Brick (value 40)\n\nThus, giving up resources worth 88 for Brick worth 40 is not a good trade.\n\nPlayer 1 rejected the offer once again without making any new trades, suggesting they might have lower resources or might not find a favorable offer.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nSince resources from the previous round have not changed, I need to propose a trade that either offers valuable resources or looks to acquire useful ones at a beneficial rate. Given that Brick is relatively valuable and I currently have none, I could try and create a trade offer that would capitalize on other players' possible needs.\n\n**Proposed Trade Offer:**\nConsidering my low supply of high-value items, I can make the following offer:\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]`\n\nThis trade will allow me to convert my lower-value resources into high-value bricks, potentially increasing my resource value in the next turn.\n\nI will propose this to Player 1. \n\n**Next Move:**\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]`",
