Let's offer 4 Wheat and 2 Sheep.\n  - Value of 4 Wheat = 4 * 5 = 20\n  - Value of 2 Sheep = 2 * 18 = 36\n  - Total value given = 20 + 36 = 56\n- We request 1 Brick in return.\n  - Value of 1 Brick = 26\n\nThis trade is not favorable as we are giving away 56 value for 26 value. Let's think of another option.\n\nLet's directly analyze making a new offer or responding to the current one.\n\nSince the current offer from Player 0 is not beneficial, we can either deny it or make a counteroffer. \n\nGiven that denying the offer doesn't cost us anything and we can try to make a better deal, let's first deny the current offer and then think about making a new offer.\n\nAction: \n[Deny]\n\nLet's make a new offer: \nWe can offer '[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Brick]' because 4 Wood = 40 value and 1 Brick = 26 value. This is still not a good trade for us.\n\nA better trade could be: '[Offer: 2 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 4 Wood]' is not valid since we're giving more value (2*26 + 18 = 70) for less value (4*10 = 40).\n\nLet's directly propose a potentially good trade: \n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'\n\nHere, \n- We're giving: 5 Wheat (5*5 = 25) and 1 Sheep (18) = Total value of 43.\n- We're getting: 1 Ore (34).\n\nThis is still not a great trade because we're giving more value than we're getting.\n\nLet's directly check another possible trade.\n'[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'.\n\n- We're giving: 3 Wheat = 15 value.\n- We're getting: 1 Brick = 26 value.\n\nSince 26 is greater than 15, this is a good trade.\n\nAction: \n'[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'",

Player 0 offered 6 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore.\n   - Offered: 6 Wheat (6*5=30) + 3 Sheep (3*18=54) = 84\n   - Requested: 1 Ore (1*34=34)\n   - Since 84 > 34, I rejected it.\n\n3. I offered 4 Wood -> 1 Brick.\n   - Offered: 4 Wood (4*10=40)\n   - Requested: 1 Brick (1*26=26)\n   - This is not favorable as 40 > 26.\n\n4. I offered 5 Wood -> 2 Brick.\n   - Offered: 5 Wood (5*10=50)\n   - Requested: 2 Brick (2*26=52)\n   - This is slightly favorable as 50 < 52.\n\nLet's reassess the current situation and consider a new offer.\n\nTo increase my total resource value, I should look for opportunities to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. \n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of my Wheat (Value: 5) or Sheep (Value: 18) for Ore (Value: 34), as Ore is more valuable than both.\n\nAnother potential trade could be offering some of my Wood (Value: 10) or Sheep (Value: 18) for Brick (Value: 26), as Brick is more valuable than Wood and potentially Sheep if the ratio is right.\n\nLet's consider the last offer I made and adjust it slightly. \n\nSince my last offer of 5 Wood for 2 Brick was almost even and was rejected, I could try to offer a bit more Wood for the same 2 Brick, or adjust the quantity.\n\nLet's make a new offer: \n[Offer: 6 Wood -> 2 Brick]\n\n- Offered: 6 Wood (6*10=60)\n- Requested: 2 Brick (2*26=52)\n\nThis is still not favorable, so I might need to reconsider or wait for Player 0's next move.\n\nHowever, I can try one more thing. Let's think about trading some less valuable resources for Ore.\n\n[Offer: 10 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\n- Offered: 10 Sheep (10*18=180)\n- Requested: 1 Ore (1*34=34)\n\nThis is not a good trade for me.\n\nLet's directly offer something more sensible:\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\n- Offered: 2 Wheat (2*5=10) + 1 Sheep (1*18=18) = 28\n- Requested: 1 Ore (1*34=34)\n\nThis seems like a potentially good trade.\n\nMy action:\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

I should adjust my strategy.\n\nLet's re-evaluate my resources and think about a potential trade. I have a lot of Sheep and relatively low-value resources like Wheat. I should try to get rid of some of my lower-value resources or excess resources for more valuable ones.\n\nConsidering my resources:\n- Giving away some Sheep or Wheat could be beneficial if I get a good deal.\n- I have tried trading Wood for Brick, but it was rejected. Let's think about other options.\n\nLet's analyze the offers I received:\n- Player 0 initially offered '[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' and later '[Offer: 6 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'. Both were rejected. The values are:\n  - 5 Wheat = 25, 6 Wheat = 30\n  - 3 Sheep = 54\n  - 1 Ore = 34\n  The total value given is 79 (for 5 Wheat) or 84 (for 6 Wheat), and the value received is 34. These offers are not favorable.\n\nSince my previous offer to trade Wood for Brick was rejected, I should either try a different ratio or consider other resources.\n\nLet's think about an alternative:\n- I have 24 Sheep. Offering some Sheep for a more valuable resource could be a good strategy.\n- I can try to offer '[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' and see if Player 0 is interested. The value of 4 Sheep is 72, and 1 Ore is 34. This is still not a good trade for me.\n\nLet's directly evaluate the value of my resources and consider other potential trades.\n\nHowever, I can attempt to make a more appealing offer by reconsidering the value of the resources.\n\nAn alternative is to directly offer what I think is a reasonable trade:\n- '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' \n  - 3 Sheep = 54\n  - 1 Wheat = 5\n  - Total = 59\n  - 1 Ore = 34\n\nThis is still not a good trade. \n\nLet's directly adjust the strategy and make a new offer.\n\nConsidering I have excess Sheep and Wood, let's try to make a more appealing offer to convert them into more valuable resources.\n\nLet's think about offering Sheep and Wheat for Ore again or trying a different combination.\n\nMy next action is to make a new offer: \n'[Offer: 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' \nLet's see how Player 0 responds.\n\nTo follow the required format, my action is:\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
