      "response": "I\u2019m trying to get a read on what Player 1 values.  \nFrom the first round I learned they\u2019re relatively eager to give up Brick (they ceded 7 Brick for 11 Wheat + 2 Ore), but they firmly refuse to trade 2 Brick + 1 Sheep for 7 Wood, so Wood clearly isn\u2019t exciting to them.  \nThey keep proposing the same deal\u20147 Wood + 10 Wheat for 3 Brick + 2 Ore\u2014so they\u2019re very comfortable with Wood, value Wheat moderately, and place a premium on retaining Brick and Ore.\n\nI also noticed they just repeated that exact offer they made last turn (and every previous turn they\u2019ve proposed it), so it looks like they aren\u2019t willing to negotiate further and simply want to hammer me with their preferred rate. I need to shake things up and create a fairer trade from my perspective.\n\nCurrent resources after the first accepted trade:  \n- Wheat: 0  \n- Wood: 17  \n- Sheep: 4  \n- Brick: 17  \n- Ore: 6  \n\nMy goal is to accumulate Brick while keeping useful quantities of Sheep and Ore, dumping excess Wood along the way.\n\nPlayer 1 has already shown they\u2019ll part with Brick if the premium is high enough, but they still reject anything close to 1:1 Wood-to-Brick. Since they\u2019ve now repeated the same perfectly symmetrical offer twice in a row, I suspect they\u2019re looking mainly for Ore and Brick rather than Wood/Wheat acceleration.  \nThe rough market reasoning:  \n\u2013 I value Brick at 27, Ore at 32, Sheep at 17, Wood at 11.  \n\u2013 Trading 3 Brick (81 value) straight up costs me a lot; they\u2019re offering Wood + Wheat as return.  \nTheir 7 Wood + 10 Wheat for 3 Brick + 2 Ore would be giving up (81 + 64 = 145 value) for (77 + 0 = 77 value)\u2014clearly against me.\n\nSo instead of just rejecting again, let me propose a counter that leverages my surplus Wood while still giving them enough gain to consider. I\u2019ll offer a small cash-like Sheep premium as an enticement since Sheep are very liquid at 17 and I have only 4.\n\nLet\u2019s test:\n\n[Offer: 8 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 5 Brick]\n\nThat\u2019s 8 Wood (88) + 1 Sheep (17) = 105 from my side.  \nI ask for 5 Brick (135). Net: Player 1 gains 105, loses 135 \u2192 they\u2019re down 30, but it\u2019s the closest fair value I can achieve without Ore.\n\nI\u2019ll phrase the chat line as:\n\nPlayer 0: \u201cI see you\u2019re very interested in holding onto Brick\u2014totally understandable. My surplus is Wood, so how about a straight 8 Wood + 1 Sheep for 5 Brick? That trims my Wood glut and still credits you with premium Sheep. Sound fair?\u201d",
