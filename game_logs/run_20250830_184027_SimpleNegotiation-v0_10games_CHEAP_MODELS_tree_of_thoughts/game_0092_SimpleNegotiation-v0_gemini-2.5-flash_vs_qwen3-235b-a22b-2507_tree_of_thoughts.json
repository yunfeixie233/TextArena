(Good trade on paper, but P1 might value what I'm offering higher or what I'm asking lower)\n\nPlayer 1 offered: 1 Ore (Value: 39)\nPlayer 1 requested: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep (Value: 24 + 17 = 41) --> Player 0 rejected. (Smart move, I would lose 2 value)\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 1 Ore (Value: 39)\nPlayer 0 requested: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep (Value: 24 + 17 = 41) --> Player 1 accepted. This means I lost 2 value. This is a mistake. I should have kept my rejections consistent.\n\nCurrent Resources After Accepted Trade:\nMy Resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 8    Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 8    Value: 12\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 12 + 1 = 13   Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 14 + 1 = 15   Value: 24\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 9 - 1 = 8    Value: 39\nTotal Value: (8*5) + (8*12) + (13*17) + (15*24) + (8*39) = 40 + 96 + 221 + 360 + 312 = 1029\n\nMy total value increased from 1027 to 1029. This is good, even if the individual trade seemed negative. It shows I need to re-evaluate my internal value calculations vs. the actual outcome.\n\nPlayer 1 made no new trade offer. Now it's my turn.\n\nMy goal is to increase my total value.\n\nThoughts for the next offer:\n*   My Ore is valuable. I have 8 now.\n*   Sheep and Brick are less valuable per unit than Ore. I have plenty of these.\n*   Wheat is the least valuable. I have 8.\n*   Wood is next in value and quantity. I have 8.\n\nI should try to trade away lower-value items for higher-value items.\nOr trade items I have in abundance for items I have less of, if the value is right.\nMy last trade was 1 Ore (39) for 1 Brick (24) and 1 Sheep (17) which has a total value of 41. I GAVE UP 39, and GOT 41 in return. So I actually gained 2 points! So my previous assessment was wrong. I should always calculate the value of what I am GIVING UP and what I am GAINING.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore or other high-value items, by giving up Sheep, Brick, Wheat, or Wood.\n\nNew Offer idea:\nOffer a combination of Wheat, Wood, Sheep, or Brick for Ore.\nHow about offering a good amount of low-value items for 1 Ore?\nFor example, 1 Ore (Value 39).\nI could offer:\n*   2 Brick (48) - too much.\n*   1 Brick (24) + 1 Wood (12) + 1 Wheat (5) = 41. This is a good trade for me, I gain 2 value.\n*   3 Sheep (51) - too much.\n*   1 Sheep (17) + 1 Brick (24) = 41. Also good. I have a lot of sheep and brick.\n\nLet's try a variation of the last successful accepted trade, but leaning more in my favor.\nI successfully traded 1 Ore for 1 Brick and 1 Sheep (total value 41).\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick and 1 Sheep for 1 Ore? This is the exact opposite of the previous successful trade, meaning it's good for P1. I want to make an offer that is good for me.\n\nMy goal is to acquire more high-value resources (Ore primarily, perhaps Brick too) while shedding lower-value ones (Wheat, Wood, Sheep).\n\nLet's try to trade 3 Wheat for something. Value 15.\nMaybe 3 Wheat for 1 Wood? (Value 12). I lose 3. No.\nHow about 3 Wheat + 1 Wood (15+12=27) for 1 Brick (24). I lose 3. No.\n\nI need to be careful with the value calculation, as P1 seems to accept trades where I gain.\n\nLet's look at P1's behavior and my successful trade:\nPlayer 0 offered: 1 Ore (39) -> Requested: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep (41). Player 1 Accepted.\nThis implies Player 1 values 1 Ore higher than 1 Brick + 1 Sheep, or they have a surplus of Brick/Sheep or a deficit of Ore.\n\nSince I have more Sheep (13) and Brick (15) and less Ore (8), I want to trade in the opposite direction.\nI want to GET Ore.\nSo I will OFFER Sheep and/or Brick.\n\nWhat about 3 Sheep (value 51) for 1 Ore (value 39) + 1 Wheat (value 5)? Total requested value 44. I give 51, get 44. I lose 7. Bad.\n\nLet's target getting 1 Ore. I need to offer items whose collective value is slightly higher than 39 for P1 to accept, but not so high that I lose significant value.\nThe last trade was I gave 39, got 41. So I want to give X, get Y, where Y > X.\n\nOffer: 2 Brick (Value: 48) -> Request: 1 Ore (Value: 39). I lose 9. No.\nOffer: 1 Brick (Value: 24) + 1 Wood (Value: 12) = 36 -> Request: 1 Ore (Value: 39). I gain 3. This is a good offer for me. P1 might reject this as I am gaining.\n\nOffer: 1 Sheep (Value: 17) + 1 Wood (Value: 12) + 1 Wheat (Value: 5) = 34 -> Request: 1 Ore (Value 39). I gain 5. This is very good for me. P1 might reject.\n\nI have an abundance of Sheep (13) and Brick (15). Let's use them.\nOffer: 2 Sheep (Value: 34) -> Request: 1 Brick (Value: 24). I lose 10. No.\n\nLet's try to make an offer similar to my last accepted one from P1's perspective: where P1 would gain.\nP1 gained 2 value by trading 1 Ore for 1 Brick and 1 Sheep.\nSo if I want to offer to P1, I need to make P1 gain.\nI was wrong in my interpretation of the last trade's positivity. I gave 1 Ore (39) and Got 1 Brick and 1 Sheep (41). So I gained 2 from the trade. That's a good trade.\nSo I should continue to make offers where I gain.\n\nLet's try for 1 Ore.\nI want to give items whose value is slightly less than 39.\nOffer: 1 Brick (24) + 1 Sheep (17) = 41. (This would be offering what I received last time). Request: 1 Ore (39). I lose 2. This is bad.\n\nLet's try to trade away low-value items for higher value ones.\nWhat about offering small amounts of multiple low-value resources?\nValue of a single Ore: 39. Value of a single Brick: 24. Value of a single Sheep: 17. Value of a single Wood: 12. Value of a single Wheat: 5.\n\nI will try to make an offer where I gain a small amount of value (2-5).\n\nCurrent resources:\nWheat: 8 (40)\nWood: 8 (96)\nSheep: 13 (221)\nBrick: 15 (360)\nOre: 8 (312)\nTotal: 1029\n\nLet's offer a combination of Wheat, Wood, Sheep, or Brick for Ore.\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep (Value 34) -> Request: 1 Ore (Value 39). I gain 5 value. This is a good offer from my side. P1 might accept this if they value Sheep less than Ore and they don't value the value difference the same way as me.\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
