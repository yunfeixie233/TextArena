      "response": "### Negotiation Game: Initial Assessment\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 18, Value: 6\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 23, Value: 8\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 19, Value: 17\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 9, Value: 28\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 10, Value: 36\n\n#### Initial Total Value:\nTo determine the initial total value, we calculate:  \n\\(18 \\times 6 + 23 \\times 8 + 19 \\times 17 + 9 \\times 28 + 10 \\times 36\\)  \n\\(= 108 + 184 + 323 + 252 + 360\\)  \n\\(= 1227\\)\n\n#### Strategy:\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources through trades. To achieve this, we need to:\n1. Identify resources that are undervalued relative to others.\n2. Make offers that exchange lower-value resources (or those we have in surplus) for higher-value resources.\n\n#### Turn 1 Analysis:\nLet's examine potential trades. We have a good quantity of Sheep (Value: 17) and a significant amount of Wood (Value: 8). Ore (Value: 36) and Brick (Value: 28) are valuable, but we have relatively fewer of them.\n\n#### Potential Trade:\nTo start, we could consider offering some of our less valuable resources or those we have in abundance for more valuable ones. For example, offering Wood (lower value) in exchange for Brick or Ore (higher value) could be beneficial.\n\n#### Proposed Trade for Turn 1:\nLet's propose: `[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis trade involves giving away 5 Wood (Value: 8 * 5 = 40) for 1 Ore (Value: 36). While this seems unfavorable at first glance because we're giving away resources worth 40 for something worth 36, it's actually not a good trade. We need to think about what we can realistically offer that would be beneficial.\n\n#### Alternative Trade:\nConsidering our resources and their values, a more reasonable initial trade might involve offering some Wheat (the lowest value resource) for a more valuable resource. Let's propose: `[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nHere, we're offering 6 Wheat (Value: 6 * 6 = 36) for 1 Brick (Value: 28). Again, this is not favorable as we're losing value.\n\n#### Re-evaluating Resources:\nUpon closer inspection, a potentially better strategy is to look for opportunities where we can gain more value. Let's directly examine a potentially beneficial trade.\n\n#### Turn 1 Action:\nLet's directly propose a potentially beneficial trade. Since both of the above trades are not beneficial, let's think about what we really need. We have a relatively low amount of Brick and a decent amount of Sheep. Let's try to propose a trade that involves Sheep and Brick.\n\nProposed Action: `[Offer: 2 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 3 Brick]`\n\nLet's calculate the value:  \n- Giving away 2 Sheep (2 * 17 = 34) and 3 Wood (3 * 8 = 24), total value given = 34 + 24 = 58.  \n- Receiving 3 Brick (3 * 28 = 84).  \n- Net gain = 84 - 58 = 26.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable trade.\n\n### Action for Turn 1:\n`[Offer: 2 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 3 Brick]`",

I accepted an offer from Player 1: received 6 Sheep in exchange for 4 Wood.\n   - Wood: 23 - 4 = 19\n   - Sheep: 19 + 6 = 25\n4.

Consider trading resources with lower values for those with higher values.\n2. Evaluate the resources we have and their values:\n   - Ore (36) and Brick (28) are high-value resources.\n   - Sheep (17) is moderately valuable.\n   - Wood (8) and Wheat (6) are less valuable.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a trade offer.\nSince we have a good amount of Brick and Ore, and relatively fewer Sheep, we should consider trading some of our less valuable or equally valuable resources for something more valuable or needed. However, given the current resources, offering something like Wood for Ore could be a good start, as we have a relatively high quantity of Wood and Ore is valuable.\n\n## Step 6: Decide on a specific trade offer.\nLet's consider offering 4 Wood for 1 Ore, as it is a reasonable trade given the previous interactions and our current resource state.\n\n## Step 7: Check if the proposed trade is beneficial.\nCurrent Wood: 23, Ore: 11\n- Offering 4 Wood: Wood = 23 - 4 = 19, Value change = -4 * 8 = -32\n- Getting 1 Ore: Ore = 11 + 1 = 12, Value change = +1 * 36 = +36\nNet gain = 36 - 32 = +4\n\nThis trade is beneficial.\n\n## Step 8: Formulate the trade offer in the required format.\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]}$",
