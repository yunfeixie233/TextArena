Increasing Ore would boost total value the most.\n   - Sheep (17) and Brick (30) are also valuable, but I already have decent amounts.\n   - Wood (8) and Wheat (5) are lower-value, so trading them for higher-value resources is ideal.\n\n3. **Prior Trades**:\n   - 8 Wood \u2192 4 Ore was rejected (loss of 64 value vs. gain of 144 \u2192 net gain 80, but rejected)\n   - 10 Wood \u2192 3 Ore was rejected (loss of 80 vs. gain of 108 \u2192 net gain 28, but rejected)\n   - Player 0 seems unwilling to part with Ore for Wood. Likely Ore is scarce for them too.\n\n4. **New Strategy**:\n   - Instead of Wood, try offering other resources like Sheep (which I have 14 of). Sheep might be more appealing to Player 0.\n   - Target Ore or Brick (Brick at 30 is very valuable).\n\n5. **Proposal**:\n   - Attempt to trade Sheep for Ore (since Sheep is 17 and Ore is 36 \u2192 a small amount of Sheep for a little Ore is a net gain).\n   - Example: 3 Sheep (51 value) \u2192 2 Ore (72 value) \u2192 net gain of 21.\n\n6. **Trade Offer**:\n   - Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\n     - This is a complex offer. Let me recalculate:\n     - Giving: 3 Sheep (51) + 2 Ore (72) \u2192 total loss = 123.\n     - Receiving: 5 Brick (150) + 2 Sheep (34) \u2192 total gain = 184.\n     - Net gain = 184 - 123 = 61.\n     - This is beneficial and might be attractive to Player 0 if they value Ore.\n\nHowever, the initial thought was to straighten out the offers. Let me simplify.\n\n7. **Correct Trade Offer**:\n   - Offer a straightforward trade: 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore\n   - Net gain: 3*17=51 loss vs 2*36=72 gain \u2192 +21.\n   - Player 0 rejected Wood offers, so Sheep might be more appealing.\n\n8. **Final Decision**:\n   - Given Player 0 rejected Ore-for-Wood offers, offer Sheep for Ore instead.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
