      "response": "I will act as Player 0. My goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I need to be strategic in my offers and acceptances.\n\nMy current total value: (25 * 5) + (5 * 9) + (22 * 12) + (16 * 22) + (16 * 40) = 125 + 45 + 264 + 352 + 640 = 1426\n\nLet's start by analyzing my current resources and their values. Ore is the most valuable per unit, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and Wheat. I have a good amount of Brick and Ore, and a decent amount of Wheat and Sheep. My Wood quantity is low.\n\nI will try to trade for more valuable resources or resources that I have a low quantity of and might need.\n\n**Turn 1:**\nI will make an offer to trade some of my less valuable resources for more valuable ones, or to get more of a resource I am low on, like Wood. I have a lot of Wheat, which is my least valuable resource. I also have a decent amount of Sheep and Brick.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat for something more valuable. What about Wheat for Ore? Or Wheat for Wood to balance my stock?\n\nI'll aim for an offer that benefits me by increasing my total value.\n\nIf I offer Wheat (Value 5) for Wood (Value 9) or Ore (Value 40), that's a good trade if I can get a good ratio.\n\nLet's try to trade a significant amount of Wheat for some Ore or Brick.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 10 * 5 = 50\nValue requested: 1 * 40 = 40\nThis would be a loss for me. I need to ensure my offers increase my value.\n\nLet's rethink. I want to offer resources where the total value of what I offer is less than the total value of what I request.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat. I could try to trade some for Brick.\nValue of Wheat = 5\nValue of Brick = 22\n\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (value 15), I'd want at least 1 Brick (value 22). This isn't a bad starting point for a negotiation.\n\nLet's consider trading some Sheep (Value 12) or Brick (Value 22) for Ore (Value 40) to concentrate on higher-value resources.\n\nHow about trading a few Wheat for a single Wood?\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Wood]\nValue offered: 3 * 5 = 15\nValue requested: 1 * 9 = 9\nThis is also a loss.\n\nI need to be careful with the value calculation for each offer.\n\nLet's try to trade a resource I have a lot of (Wheat, Sheep) for a more valuable one, ensuring a positive value change for me.\n\nMy most abundant low-value resource is Wheat. My most valuable resource is Ore.\n\n**My first offer will be:** I want to trade some Sheep and Wheat for Brick. My current Brick quantity is 16.\n\nLet's try:\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 3 Brick]\nValue offered: (5 * 12) + (5 * 5) = 60 + 25 = 85\nValue requested: 3 * 22 = 66\nThis is a loss for me (85 vs 66).\n\nI need to get *more* value than I give.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick for 3 Sheep, for example? (Value of 1 Brick = 22, Value of 3 Sheep = 36). That's a loss for me.\n\nOkay, let's try to get Ore, as it's the highest value.\nI have a good amount of Brick. What if I trade 1 Brick for 1 Ore? Value is 22 for 40. That's a great deal for me. But opponent will likely deny.\nI could offer more Brick for more Ore.\n\nI'll try to trade a combination of my abundant resources (Wheat, Sheep) for a limited but valuable resource (Ore, Brick).\n\nLet's target Ore.\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (4 * 12) + (5 * 5) = 48 + 25 = 73\nValue requested: 1 * 40 = 40\nStill a loss for me. My opponent is likely to accept this, but it will decrease my total value.\n\nI need to make an offer where: `Value(Requested Resources) > Value(Offered Resources)`\n\nLet's focus on my high quantity/low value resources: Wheat (25, Value 5), Sheep (22, Value 12).\nLet's try to get Brick (Value 22).\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 2 Brick]\nValue Offered: (3 * 12) + (3 * 5) = 36 + 15 = 51\nValue Requested: 2 * 22 = 44\nStill a loss for me! I need to be more aggressive in requesting value.\n\nLet's flip it. Offer something I have less of, but which is valuable, for something I have a lot of, and highly value it. But that's not how it works. I need to make an offer that is good for *me*.\n\nLet's aim to get 1 Ore.\nTo get 1 Ore (Value 40), I would need to offer less than 40 units of value.\nFor example, if I offer some Wheat (Value 5).\n[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue Offered: 7 * 5 = 35\nValue Requested: 1 * 40 = 40\nThis is a gain of 5 value for me! This is an ideal type of offer. My opponent might deny because it's a good deal for me.\n\nLet's try this for the first turn. It shows I understand the value system and am aiming to increase my overall value.\n\n**Turn 1 Offer:** [Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
