      "response": "### Negotiation Game Analysis\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: 21 - 5 = 16 (since we traded 5 Wheat for 1 Brick)  \n  - Quantity: 16  \n  - Value: 6  \n- Wood: 19  \n  - Quantity: 19  \n  - Value: 10  \n- Sheep: 9  \n  - Quantity: 9  \n  - Value: 15  \n- Brick: 10 + 1 = 11 (since we received 1 Brick for 5 Wheat)  \n  - Quantity: 11  \n  - Value: 24  \n- Ore: 6 - 1 = 5 (since we traded 1 Ore for 1 Brick and some other resources)  \n  - Quantity: 5  \n  - Value: 36  \n\n#### Turn Analysis:\nWe are currently on a new turn, and it's our turn to act.  \n- Previous offers from Player0 were rejected or not in our favor.  \n- Our last offer to Player0 was 8 Wheat for 1 Ore, which was rejected.  \n- We previously traded 5 Wheat for 1 Brick, which was accepted.\n\n#### Game State:\n- Total Turns: 10  \n- Current Turn: We need to determine the exact turn based on the history provided.\n\nLet's analyze the last known state and the history:\n1. Player0 made an offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick. We rejected.\n2. Player0 made another offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick. We rejected.\n3. Player0 made an offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick. We rejected.\n4. We made an offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick. Player0 accepted.\n5. Player0 made an offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick. We rejected.\n6. We made an offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore. Player0 rejected.\n\nGiven the resources and the last turn's actions, let's consider our next move.\n\n### Decision Making:\n1. **Evaluate the current resources**: We have a good amount of Wheat and Wood, a moderate amount of Sheep and Brick, and a relatively lower amount of Ore.\n   \n2. **Consider the values**: Ore has the highest value, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\n3. **Analyze the previous trades**: We successfully traded 5 Wheat for 1 Brick, indicating that Player0 values Brick and is willing to give it up for Wheat.\n\n4. **Formulate a new offer**:\n   - Since our offer of 8 Wheat for 1 Ore was rejected, we might need to offer more or something different.\n   - Considering the value of Ore is high, we should still try to get more Ore if possible.\n\n### Proposed Trade Offer:\nLet's think about a reasonable trade:\n- We could offer some Wheat and/or Wood (since we have a good amount of both) for Ore.\n\n### The Offer:\n`[Offer:10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\n### Action:\n`[Offer:10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis is our proposed action for the current turn.",
