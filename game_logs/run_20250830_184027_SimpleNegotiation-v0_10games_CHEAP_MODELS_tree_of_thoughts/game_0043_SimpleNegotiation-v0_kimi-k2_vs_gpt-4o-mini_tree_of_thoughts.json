Accepted: Player 0 offered 5 Brick, 3 Sheep for 6 Ore, 2 Wood.\n   - New resources: \n     - Wheat: 16\n     - Wood: 9 (after losing 2 Wood)\n     - Sheep: 17 (after losing 3 Sheep)\n     - Brick: 10 (after gaining 5 Brick)\n     - Ore: 14 (after losing 6 Ore)\n\n2.

Trading 2 Wheat for 1 Brick does not provide a positive gain in total value because I would be losing 2 Wheat (Value: 5 each) to gain only 1 Brick (Value: 22). Therefore, this offer is not beneficial.\n\nI will **deny** the offer.\n\nSo, my action will be:\n\n`[Deny]`",
