      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I will analyze the current situation and make a strategic trade offer. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of my current resources:\n- Wheat: 19 * 5 = 95\n- Wood: 20 * 8 = 160\n- Sheep: 5 * 18 = 90\n- Brick: 10 * 27 = 270\n- Ore: 19 * 35 = 665\n\nTotal value = 95 + 160 + 90 + 270 + 665 = 1280\n\nTo make a profitable trade, I need to identify which resources are relatively undervalued or overvalued compared to others. \n\nLet's examine the potential trades based on the values:\n- Giving away resources with lower values and getting resources with higher values would be beneficial.\n\nOne strategy could be to offer resources with lower individual values (like Wheat or Wood) in exchange for resources with higher individual values (like Brick or Ore).\n\nFor my first move, I will consider offering some Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 8) for a resource that is more valuable. \n\nLet's offer 10 Wheat for 1 Ore (since Ore is the most valuable resource):\n- Giving away: 10 Wheat = 10 * 5 = 50 value\n- Receiving: 1 Ore = 1 * 35 = 35 value\nThis is not a good trade for me as it results in a net loss.\n\nLet's consider another option: offering some Wood (Value: 8) for Brick (Value: 27) or Sheep (Value: 18).\n- Offering 3 Wood = 3 * 8 = 24 value for 1 Sheep = 1 * 18 = 18 value is not good.\n- Offering 2 Wood = 2 * 8 = 16 value for 1 Brick = 1 * 27 = 27 value is beneficial as it gains 11 value.\n\nTherefore, a potential trade could be:\n'[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]'\n\nHowever, to make it more appealing and to actually get the trade done, I might need to adjust the quantities.

Player 0 offered 2 Wood for 1 Brick. (Player 1 rejected)\n2. No new offer from Player 1.\n3. The non-existent new offer from Player 1 was \"rejected\" by Player 0 (since there was no new offer).\n4. Player 0 offered 2 Ore for 1 Sheep. (Player 1 rejected)\n5. Player 1 offered 1 Sheep for 1 Ore.\n\nLet's analyze the last offer made by Player 1: [Offered items: 1 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore]\n- Player 0 has 19 Ore and 5 Sheep.\n- The value of 1 Sheep is 18, and the value of 1 Ore is 35.\n\nTo evaluate this trade:\n- Giving 1 Ore (Value: 35) for 1 Sheep (Value: 18) is not beneficial because it decreases the total value (from the perspective of Player 0).\n\nLet's calculate the outcome if Player 0 accepts the offer:\n- Losing 1 Ore (35) and gaining 1 Sheep (18) means a net loss of 17.\n\nSince the trade is not in favor of Player 0, the best action would be to '[Deny]' this offer.\n\nHowever, let's think about making a new offer. Given the previous rejections and the current state, we should consider what would be a good trade.\n\nConsidering the values:\n- Ore is the most valuable resource for Player 0.\n- Sheep is relatively valuable and was requested in the previous offer made by Player 0.\n\nLet's examine if we can propose a trade that could be beneficial or at least reasonable:\n- The last offer by Player 0 (2 Ore for 1 Sheep) was rejected. Perhaps offering fewer Ore or more Sheep could be considered, but since Sheep is less valuable than Ore, it's a matter of finding a balance.\n\nLet's propose a new offer. One possibility is to adjust the last offer slightly. Instead of 2 Ore for 1 Sheep, we could think about trading something else or adjusting the quantity.\n\nA potential offer could be: '[Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep]' or something similar that seems reasonable. Let's calculate its value:\n- 1 Ore (35) + 1 Brick (27) = 62\n- 2 Sheep (2*18) = 36\n\nThis trade is still not in our favor. Let's think about our resources again and what we could offer that might be more appealing or at least balanced.\n\nAnother potential trade could involve our less valuable resources. For example, giving away some Wheat or Wood.\n\nConsidering the available resources and their values, let's directly propose a new offer.\n\nA new offer: '[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Sheep]' \n- 5 Wood = 5 * 8 = 40\n- 1 Sheep = 18\n\nThis is not a good trade for us.\n\nLet's directly analyze the best action for the current turn.\n\nSince the last offer from Player 1 is not beneficial, we should '[Deny]' it.\n\n'[Deny]' is the default action for an incoming offer we don't accept, so we can simply proceed with proposing a new offer or sticking with the default denial.\n\nGiven the situation, let's deny the offer and think about our next step.\n\nThe best action is: '[Deny]'",

However, considering the value difference, it might still be worth trying a variation or accepting if offered inversely.\n   - Player 0 has tried offering Wood for Brick and Ore, and Sheep for Ore, all of which were rejected.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since Player 1 has not accepted any offer yet, we need to either persist with a similar offer or change our strategy slightly.\n   - Given that Ore is highly valued and Sheep is less valued in comparison, offering something for Sheep might be beneficial if we can get a higher or equally valued resource.\n\n### Decision for Next Turn:\nLet's try a different combination.

This is not a good trade for me. I should reject it. I will also make a counter offer that benefits me. I have a lot of Brick and Ore, which are high value. I still need to increase my total value, but not by exchanging more valuable resources for less valuable ones.\n\nOffer I would like to make:\nInstead of giving up Ore, I could offer Sheep for Ore, since Ore is more valuable to me. Or I could offer Brick for Ore, since Brick is less valuable than Ore. I have 22 Brick, so I could trade some. I have 23 Ore, so I can give some, but I prefer not to unless I get a lot for it.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (value 20) for 1 Sheep (value 17)? That's a loss for me.\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (value 20) for 1 Wood (value 10)? That's a loss for me.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nI could offer Brick for Ore. For example, 1 Brick (20) for 1 Ore (33) would be a good trade for me, but the opponent is unlikely to accept. How about giving up 1 Brick (20) for 1 Ore (33) and 1 Wood (10)? That is not a good offer for the opponent.\n\nLet's try to get resources I have less of, or that are more valuable.\nI have 9 Sheep, so I could try to increase that. How about offering 1 Brick (20) for 1 Sheep (17)? No, that's not good.\nWhat if I offer 1 Wheat (6) for 1 Wood (10)? That is profitable.\nWhat if I offer 2 Wheat (12) for 1 Wood (10)? Not profitable.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat currently.\nOffer: 2 Wheat (12) -> 1 Sheep (17) (Gain 5)\nOr: 3 Wheat (18) -> 1 Sheep (17) (Loss 1)\nOr: 1 Brick (20) -> 1 Sheep (17) (Loss 3)\nOr: 1 Wood (10) -> 1 Wheat (6) (Loss 4)\n\nLet's try to offload some Wheat, and get more Sheep or Wood.\nMy current values are:\nWheat: 6\nWood: 10\nSheep: 17\nBrick: 20\nOre: 33\n\nIf I receive 1 Sheep (17) for 2 Wheat (12), I gain 5.

However, my offers to trade Ore for Sheep were rejected. Let's try offering something else for Ore or Sheep.\n\nConsidering my resources and the previous rejections, I could try:\n- Offering Wood for Ore, as I have a substantial amount of Wood and it's less valuable than Ore.\n\nLet's make an offer: [Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nMy response should be: [Offer: 4 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 1 Ore]\n\nUsing the required format: [Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nI'll send: [Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nSo, my action for this turn is: [Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
