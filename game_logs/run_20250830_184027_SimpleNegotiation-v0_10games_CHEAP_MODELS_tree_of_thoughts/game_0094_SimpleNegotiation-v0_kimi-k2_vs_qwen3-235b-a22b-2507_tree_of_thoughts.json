Specifically, they proposed 4 Ore + 2 Wheat for 3 Brick + 5 Sheep, which is the inverse of my last offer. This suggests they value Brick and Sheep higher than Ore and Wheat.\n\n**Strategy:**\nGiven that the opponent values Brick and Sheep highly, and they have Ore/Wheat to spare, I should aim to get more Ore and Wheat in exchange for my Sheep and Brick. Ore is especially valuable for me (35 per unit), so increasing my Ore count is a priority.\n\n### New Offer:\nSince the opponent is willing to give 4 Ore + 2 Wheat for 3 Brick + 5 Sheep, I can make a slightly better offer to entice them. Let's offer slightly less Brick and Sheep for the same Ore and Wheat to make it more appealing.\n\n**Proposed Offer:**\n**[Offer: 3 Brick, 4 Sheep -> 4 Ore, 2 Wheat]**\n\nThis gives me 4 Ore (valued at 140) and 2 Wheat (valued at 10) in exchange for 3 Brick (valued at 78) and 4 Sheep (valued at approximately 32). The net gain in terms of value is:\n\n(140 + 10) - (78 + 32) = 150 - 110 = +40 value increase.\n\nThis seems like a good trade for me, as it increases my total value significantly. I hope the opponent accepts since they previously wanted 3 Brick + 5 Sheep for 4 Ore + 2 Wheat, and I'm offering a similar deal with slightly less Sheep.\n\n**Communicating:**\n\"Player 1, I'm willing to give you 3 Brick and 4 Sheep for 4 Ore and 2 Wheat. This is slightly better for you since it's less Sheep than before. Let me know if you're interested.\"\n\n**[Offer: 3 Brick, 4 Sheep -> 4 Ore, 2 Wheat]**",

      "response": "We\u2019re now at the half-way point (turns 7\u201310 left).  \nMy current stock and per-unit worth (\u2192 total point value):\n\nWheat \u2026 8 u \u00d7 5 = 40  \nWood \u2026 11 u \u00d7 11 = 121  \nSheep \u2026 15 u \u00d7 16 = 240  \nBrick \u2026 9 u \u00d7 26 = 234  \nOre \u2026 5 u \u00d7 35 = 175  \nTotal \u2248 810 points.\n\nRight before my turn Player 1 stayed silent, so the floor is still open.\n\nKey observations\n1. Ore is my most valuable single card (35 pts each). I only have five of them and should acquire more if the price is right.\n2. Brick is high-value (26 pts) and I already have a comfortable 9 units; surplus could be traded up for Ore without hurting long-term strength.\n3. Sheep are abundant (15 left after earlier offers), low-value compared with Ore, and easy to part with in small batches.\n\nTherefore I\u2019ll try one more compact offer: give up a few high-priced Brick and some surplus Sheep to obtain a net boost in high-value Ore.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick, 3 Sheep -> 4 Ore]",
