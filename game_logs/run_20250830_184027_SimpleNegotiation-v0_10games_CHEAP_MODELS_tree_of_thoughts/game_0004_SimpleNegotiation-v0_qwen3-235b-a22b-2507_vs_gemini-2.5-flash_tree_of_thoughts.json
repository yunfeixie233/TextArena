I have a lot of Ore, which is valuable, and a good amount of Brick. Sheep also have a decent value. I'm a bit low on Wheat and Wood, which are low-value items, but they could be useful for trading up.\n\nI previously offered 5 Sheep (value 80) and 3 Brick (value 90) for 6 Ore (value 216). This was a good offer for me, as I would gain 46 in value. Player 0 rejected it.\n\nLet's try to get more valuable resources by offering some of what I have in abundance. I have a lot of Ore, so I could trade some of that for higher value if I can get a good deal. Or, I can try to get more high-value resources for a combination of my lower-value ones.\n\nLet's consider an opposing viewpoint: Player 0 might be trying to get more of the higher value resources like Ore and Brick. If that's the case, I should be careful not to give them away too cheaply.\n\nPlayer 0's last offer to me was 8 Wood (value 64), 5 Wheat (value 30) for 4 Brick (value 120), 3 Sheep (value 48). Total value offered by Player 0 was 94, total value requested was 168. This was a bad deal for me (I would lose 74 value), so I rejected it.\n\nLet's try to offer a mix of medium and high-value items for higher value items. I have a lot of Brick and Ore, but I also have a lot of Sheep. Perhaps I can trade some Sheep and Brick for Ore, or vice versa, depending on the deal.\n\nI want to get more Ore, or Brick. Let's offer some Sheep and Wheat for Brick and Ore.\n\nMy goal is to increase my total resource value. A good strategy would be to get more of the highest value resources (Ore, Brick) by trading lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep).\n\nLet's try offering a relatively valuable set of items, primarily Sheep and Brick, for a larger quantity of Ore, which is the highest value.\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 4 Brick -> 6 Ore]",
