I need to make a more appealing offer for Player 1.\nMy goal is to increase my total value, so I want to acquire resources that have a higher value like Ore, or resources that are relatively high in value for my current stock like Sheep. I have a lot of Brick, so I am willing to trade some.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore. My previous offer of 10 Brick for 8 Ore was rejected. Perhaps the value was a bit off, or Player 1 didn't need Brick that much.\n10 Brick * 28 = 280\n8 Ore * 36 = 288\n\nPlayer 1 might prefer resources they need or valuable resources. I've got a good amount of Brick and Ore, but also Wheat and Wood that are low in value.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again, but offer more Brick, or offer a mix of resources, or aim for a lower quantity of Ore.\nWhat about trading some Brick for Sheep? I have 25 Brick, and 9 Sheep. Sheep are relatively high value.\n2 Brick (56) for 2 Sheep (30). No, that's not good.\n\nLet's stick with trading Brick for Ore.\nHow about offering a better ratio for Ore? Instead of 10 Brick for 8 Ore, what about 10 Brick for 7 Ore? Still not great for me.\nWhat about offering 10 Brick for 6 Ore? Value offered: 280. Value gained: 216. That's losing value.\n\nI want to acquire higher value items. Ore is ideal.\nLet's offer a combination of resources. I have surplus Brick and a decent amount of Ore.\nI need to tempt Player 1.\n\nConsider this: I have a lot of Brick. Player 1 might value Brick more than I do.\nHow about I try to get some Sheep or Wood from Player 1, as I have less of those?\nI have 14 Wheat, 5 Wood, 9 Sheep.\n\nLet's try to offer a more balanced trade from my side.\nI will try to get Ore, as it's the highest value.\n\nNew offer attempt:\nOffer 10 Brick (280) for 7 Ore (252). Still losing value.\nOffer 12 Brick (336) for 8 Ore (288). Losing value.\n\nI want to make a trade where the value difference favors me.\nI have a significant amount of Brick, so I can afford to offer more of it for a higher value resource.\nMy current value is 1639.\n\nWhat if I offer a resource that is high in quantity for me, but maybe less valuable, to get something more valuable?\nI have 14 Wheat (5 value) and 25 Brick (28 value).\nIf I offer 3 Brick for 2 Ore: Value Offered: 3 * 28 = 84. Value Requested: 2 * 36 = 72. (Again, losing value)\n\nLet's aim for a positive value trade for myself.\nIf I give 6 Brick (168) for 5 Ore (180). This is a good deal for me.
