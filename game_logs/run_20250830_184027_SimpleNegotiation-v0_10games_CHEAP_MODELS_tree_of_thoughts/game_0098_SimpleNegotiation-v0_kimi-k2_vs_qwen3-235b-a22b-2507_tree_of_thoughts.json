However, my Wheat quantity is very low\u2014trading any would leave me with none\u2014so Sheep look like the more comfortable surplus to trim.\n\nTurn-1 opening proposal:\n\n[Offer: 6 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 4 Ore, 1 Sheep]\n\n(From my side: 6\u00d712 + 1\u00d726 = 98 points; I receive 4\u00d738 + 1\u00d712 = 164 points. Net gain \u224866 points. Because the items I give away are also those I hold in high quantity, I avoid touching my scarce Wheat and I keep all my Wood. The opponent\u2019s exact values aren\u2019t known, but the deal is generous from their perspective as well\u201498 points for 164 points\u2014so it\u2019s a strong candidate for acceptance.)\n\nI will await their answer before continuing negotiations.",

      "response": "Turn 4 starts.  \nAfter studying the pattern of my previous offers, I now see that:\n1. I was over-valuing sheep (value 12 for 14 qty \u2248 0.86 per sheep) and ore (value 38 for 9 qty \u2248 4.22 per ore).  \n2. My prior 7-S-for-3-O proposal implicitly valued ore at 2.33 sheep each (.86 \u00d7 7 \u2248 6 \u21d2 6 / 3 = 2) when the true ratio is \u2248 4.22 / 0.86 = 4.9 : 1, so Player 1 rightly rejected it as giving away almost 12 value while only receiving \u2248 6.\n\nTo make a fairer deal that still improves my value, I should offer closer to the actual value ratio and use larger bundles to dilute the per-item discrepancy.\n\nMy best option now is to swap the lowest-value-per-unit resource (sheep, 0.86) for the highest (ore, 4.22). A 5 : 1 swap is still slightly favorable to me (5 \u00d7 0.86 = 4.3 vs 1 \u00d7 4.22 = 4.22), yet small enough that Player 1 might accept because the absolute gain (0.08) is negligible but the sheep bundle is sizable and useful.\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
