      "response": "Thought process:\n1. **Evaluate the Current Offer**: The opponent is offering 2 Ore for 4 Brick. The value of 2 Ore is 2 * 35 = 70, and the value of 4 Brick is 4 * 29 = 116. This is a loss of 116 - 70 = 46 value for me, so the offer is bad.\n\n2. **Check My Resources**: I have:\n   - 16 Wheat (value 5 each = 80 total)\n   - 16 Wood (value 10 each = 160 total)\n   - 13 Sheep (value 12 each = 156 total)\n   - 25 Brick (value 29 each = 725 total)\n   - 17 Ore (value 35 each = 595 total)\n   The total value of my resources is 80 + 160 + 156 + 725 + 595 = 1,716.\n\n3. **Reject the Offer**: Since the current offer is a loss, I should reject it.\n\n4. **Counteroffer**: To increase my total value, I should look for resources where I have excess or where the opponent might value my resources higher than I do. My Sheep and Wheat have the lowest values per unit (12 and 5), so I could offer these. Brick is my most valuable resource (29), so I should avoid giving it away unless the return is very high.\n\n   - A possible counteroffer could be to trade 3 Sheep (value 3 * 12 = 36) for 2 Brick (value 2 * 29 = 58). This is a gain of 58 - 36 = 22 for me. However, the opponent might not accept this.\n\n   - Alternatively, I could offer 4 Wheat (value 4 * 5 = 20) for 1 Brick (value 29), which is a gain of 9 for me. This seems more reasonable but the gain is small.\n\n   - Another angle: I have 17 Ore (the highest value besides Brick), and the opponent might want Ore. I could offer 1 Ore for 2 Brick, but they'd likely reject (1 Ore = 35, 2 Brick = 58, they'd lose 23). This won't work.\n\n   - Instead, I could offer 2 Sheep and 1 Wheat (total value 2*12 + 5 = 29) for 1 Brick (value 29). This is neutral for me but might help the opponent complete a set. However, this doesn't increase my value.\n\n   - Best approach: Offer something I have excess of (excess Wheat or Wood) for a small gain. I have 16 Wheat, so offering 5 Wheat (value 5 * 5 = 25) for 1 Brick (value 29) gives me a net gain of 4. This is a small but positive gain.\n\n   - However, the opponent may not value Wheat at 5, so this might fail. Instead, offering 2 Sheep (value 24) for 1 Brick (value 29) gives me a gain of 5, which is better.\n\n5. **Final Counteroffer**: Offer 2 Sheep (value 24) for 1 Brick (value 29). This increases my total value by 5, which is acceptable.\n\nAction:\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",
