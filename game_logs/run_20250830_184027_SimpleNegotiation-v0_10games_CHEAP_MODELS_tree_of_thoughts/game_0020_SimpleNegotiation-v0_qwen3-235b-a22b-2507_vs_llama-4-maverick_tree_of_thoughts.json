      "response": "### Current State of Resources\n\nAfter accepting the trade offer from Player 0, the resources I currently have are calculated as follows:\n\n- Initially:\n  - [Wheat]   Qty: 14   Value: 5\n  - [Wood]    Qty: 13   Value: 9\n  - [Sheep]   Qty: 22   Value: 18\n  - [Brick]   Qty: 17   Value: 22\n  - [Ore]     Qty: 17   Value: 40\n\n- After the trade:\n  - [Wheat]   Qty: 14 - 10 = 4   Value: 5\n  - [Wood]    Qty: 13 - 5 = 8   Value: 9\n  - [Sheep]   Qty: 22 + 5 - 2 = 25   Value: 18\n  - [Brick]   Qty: 17 + 5 = 22   Value: 22\n  - [Ore]     Qty: 17   Value: 40\n\nSo, the current state is:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 4   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 8   Value: 9\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 25   Value: 18\n- [Brick]   Qty: 22   Value: 22\n- [Ore]     Qty: 17   Value: 40\n\n### Next Action\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Currently, I have a significant quantity of Sheep (Value: 18) and a decent amount of Brick (Value: 22) and Ore (Value: 40). Ore is the highest value resource, so it's beneficial to keep or acquire more Ore.\n\nLet's consider making an offer that involves trading some of the resources we acquired or those that are less valuable for something more valuable. Since Ore is highly valued and we have a good amount of it, let's try not to give it away. We have an abundance of Sheep and a good amount of Brick.\n\nConsidering the values and the current quantities:\n- I can offer some Sheep and/or Brick for more Ore or other valuable resources.\n\nLet's make an offer to Player 0:\n'[Offer: 5 Sheep, 3 Brick -> 2 Ore, 1 Wood]' \n\nThis translates to offering 5 Sheep (Value: 18 * 5 = 90) and 3 Brick (Value: 22 * 3 = 66) for 2 Ore (Value: 40 * 2 = 80) and 1 Wood (Value: 9). The total value offered is 156, and the total value requested is 89. This seems unfavorable as it stands because we're giving away more value than we're getting.\n\nLet's reassess and adjust the offer to be more balanced:\n'[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' \n\nThis means offering 4 Sheep (Value: 18 * 4 = 72) for 1 Ore (Value: 40). Still, this is not in our favor as we're offering more value than we're receiving.\n\nLet's think about what we really need:\n- We need to get more value. Let's directly think about what's valuable: Ore is the most valuable.\n\nLet's adjust our strategy and make a more reasonable offer:\n'[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]'\n\nHere, we're offering 3 Brick (Value: 22 * 3 = 66) for 1 Ore (Value: 40). This is still not in our favor.\n\nLet's consider another resource:\n'[Offer: 6 Sheep -> 2 Wood]'\n\nHere, we're offering 6 Sheep (Value: 18 * 6 = 108) for 2 Wood (Value: 9 * 2 = 18). This is heavily in favor of the other player.\n\nRevisiting our resources and the goal to increase total value, let's make a more reasonable and favorable trade:\n'[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Wood]'\n\nThis translates to: \n- Offering 2 Brick (Value: 22 * 2 = 44) for 1 Wood (Value: 9).\n\nLet's adjust our strategy to be even more conservative and aim for a slightly better deal:\n'[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]' \n\nThis means giving away 2 Sheep (Value: 18 * 2 = 36) and 1 Brick (Value: 22) for 1 Ore (Value: 40), totaling 58 in value offered for 40 in value received. Still, not favorable.\n\nLet's execute a more sensible trade:\n'[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Wood]'\n\nThis is giving 1 Sheep (Value: 18) for 1 Wood (Value: 9), which is not beneficial.\n\nUpon further reflection, a more reasonable initial trade could be:\n'[Offer: 4 Brick -> 3 Ore]' \n\nThis involves giving 4 Brick (Value: 22 * 4 = 88) for 3 Ore (Value: 40 * 3 = 120), which is a gain.\n\n### Action\n\n'[Offer: 4 Brick -> 3 Ore]'",

It was rejected by Player 0.\n\n## Step 4: Consider making a new trade offer or responding to a potential offer.\nSince Player 0 made no new trade offer, I need to decide on a new offer. I should look to improve my total value. I have a lot of Sheep and Brick, and I need Ore and possibly more Wood to increase my total value, as Ore has the highest value per unit.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a new trade offer based on the current resources and the goal to increase total value.\nTo increase my total value, I should consider trading resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable. I have a surplus of Sheep and Brick. Let's consider offering some Sheep and/or Brick for Ore.\n\n## Step 6: Decide on a specific trade offer.\nLet's offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore. This means giving up (3*18) + (1*22) = 54 + 22 = 76 value for 1*40 = 40 value. This is not a good trade. Let's think of a better option.\n\n## Step 7: Reconsider the trade offer to ensure it's beneficial or at least reasonable.\nAnother option could be: Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore. Giving up 4*18 = 72 value for 1*40 = 40 value is still not beneficial. Let's adjust: Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore. This gives up (2*18) + (1*22) = 36 + 22 = 58 value for 40 value, which is still not good.\n\n## Step 8: Adjust the offer to be more reasonable.\nLet's try: Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore. This is (1*18) + (1*22) = 18 + 22 = 40 for 1*40 = 40. It's a value-neutral trade. However, I lose 1 Sheep and 1 Brick but gain 1 Ore, which doesn't increase my total value.\n\n## Step 9: Finalize a trade offer.\nConsidering the value-neutral or slightly beneficial trades, let's directly formulate a reasonable offer. Since my last offer was rejected, I need to think of a more appealing trade. Let's try to directly offer something that could be attractive: [Offer: 3 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]. This gives up (3*22) + (2*18) = 66 + 36 = 102 for 2*40 = 80, which is still not beneficial.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the trade offer to be more likely accepted.\nLet's simplify: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]. Giving up 2*18 = 36 for 1*40 = 40 is a slight gain.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]}$",

Let's consider making a new trade offer.\n\nOne possible trade is to offer some Brick (Value: 22) and Sheep (Value: 18) to get Ore (Value: 40). \n\nMy next offer is:\n[Offer: 3 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (3 * 22) + (2 * 18) = 66 + 36 = 102 and requests resources worth (2 * 40) = 80. This is not a good trade. Let's adjust.\n\nLet's make a more reasonable offer:\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (2 * 22) = 44 and requests resources worth (1 * 40) = 40. Still not very beneficial.\n\nA more balanced trade would be:\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (1 * 22) + (1 * 18) = 22 + 18 = 40 and requests resources worth (2 * 40) = 80.
