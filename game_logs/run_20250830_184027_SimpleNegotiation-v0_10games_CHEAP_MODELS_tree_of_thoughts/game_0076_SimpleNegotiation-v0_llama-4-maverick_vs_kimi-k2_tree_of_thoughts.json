      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first assess the current resources and their total value.\n\n1. **[Wheat]** Qty: 15, Value: 6 per unit. Total Value: 15 * 6 = 90\n2. **[Wood]** Qty: 17, Value: 9 per unit. Total Value: 17 * 9 = 153\n3. **[Sheep]** Qty: 21, Value: 16 per unit. Total Value: 21 * 16 = 336\n4. **[Brick]** Qty: 6, Value: 30 per unit. Total Value: 6 * 30 = 180\n5. **[Ore]** Qty: 22, Value: 33 per unit. Total Value: 22 * 33 = 726\n\nTotal Value = 90 + 153 + 336 + 180 + 726 = 1485\n\nTo increase the total value of resources, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given the values, Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n- We have a significant quantity of Ore and Sheep. Trading some of these for other resources could be beneficial if we can maintain or increase the total value.\n- Brick is valuable, but we have a relatively low quantity. Acquiring more Brick could be beneficial.\n\nConsidering the values:\n- Trading Wheat (Value: 6) for any other resource is likely beneficial.\n- Trading Wood (Value: 9) for Sheep, Brick, or Ore is beneficial.\n- Trading Sheep (Value: 16) for Brick or Ore could be beneficial.\n- Trading Brick (Value: 30) for Ore (Value: 33) might be slightly beneficial if the quantity is right.\n\nLet's start by making an offer that could potentially increase our total value. Since Ore is our most valuable resource and we have a lot of it, and Sheep is also quite valuable, we should consider trading some of these for Brick, as it's the next most valuable and we don't have much.\n\nA potential trade:\n- Offer 2 Sheep (Value: 16 each) and 1 Ore (Value: 33) for 1 Brick (Value: 30). The total value given is (2*16) + 33 = 65, and the value received is 30. This isn't a good trade because we're losing value.\n- A better approach might be to offer some Wheat or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's consider:\n- Offering 5 Wheat (5*6 = 30) for 1 Brick (30). This is a fair trade in terms of value.\n\nThus, a potential first offer could be:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\nThis is a straightforward trade that maintains our value but improves our resource diversity slightly.\n\nAction for Turn 1:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'",

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the current state of resources and the offers made so far.\n\nCurrent Resources:\n- Wheat: 15, Value: 6\n- Wood: 17, Value: 9\n- Sheep: 21, Value: 16\n- Brick: 6, Value: 30\n- Ore: 22, Value: 33\n\nPrevious Offers and Counteroffers:\n1. Player 0 offered 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick. (Rejected)\n2. Player 0 offered 2 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 2 Brick. (Rejected)\n3. Player 1 offered 3 Sheep -> 4 Brick.\n\nLet's evaluate the last offer made by Player 1: 3 Sheep -> 4 Brick.\n\n- The total value of the resources offered by Player 1 is 3 * 16 = 48 (since Sheep's value is 16).\n- The total value of the resources requested by Player 1 is 4 * 30 = 120 (since Brick's value is 30).\n\nFor Player 0, giving away 4 Brick would mean losing 4 * 30 = 120 in value, and gaining 3 * 16 = 48 in value. This is not a good trade for Player 0 as it results in a net loss of 72 in value.\n\nHowever, we should consider if there's a way to negotiate or counteroffer. Let's assess the current resource values and see if we can make a more beneficial trade or if we should accept or deny the current offer.\n\nSince the offer is not in our favor, let's consider making a counteroffer. We should look to trade resources that are of lower value to us but potentially higher value to Player 1, or at least make a trade that is more balanced.\n\nLet's analyze our resources again and think about what we can offer that might be more appealing to Player 1 while not being too costly for us.\n\nWe could consider offering some Wheat or Wood (lower value resources) in exchange for Brick (since Player 1 seems to be interested in Brick). However, we need to be cautious about the quantity and ensure we're not giving away too much value.\n\nGiven that our previous offers were rejected, we might need to adjust our strategy slightly.\n\nLet's make a new offer:\n- We have Wheat (Value: 6) and Wood (Value: 9). We could offer some of these in exchange for Brick.\n\nConsidering the values, here's a potential offer:\n- Offer 4 Wood (Value: 4 * 9 = 36) -> 1 Brick (Value: 30). This is still not great as we're losing value.\n- A more balanced approach might be to offer something like: 3 Wheat (Value: 18) and 1 Wood (Value: 9) = Total Value: 27 -> 1 Brick (Value: 30). This is still a bit of a loss but closer.\n\nLet's go with a slightly adjusted version:\n- Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick.\n\nHowever, this was already rejected once. Let's think about adjusting the offer to make it more appealing.\n\nLet's try:\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\n\nThis translates to:\n- Offering 2 Wood (2 * 9 = 18) and 4 Wheat (4 * 6 = 24), Total Value Offered = 42\n- Requesting 1 Brick (1 * 30 = 30)\n\nThis is still not ideal, but we're trying to find a balance. Let's adjust our offer slightly to be more reasonable.\n\nLet's send: \n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n\nThis offer gives away:\n- 3 Wheat = 3 * 6 = 18\n- 1 Wood = 1 * 9 = 9\nTotal = 27\n\nAnd requests:\n- 1 Brick = 30\n\nThe response will determine our next step.\n\nThe action for this turn is:\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
