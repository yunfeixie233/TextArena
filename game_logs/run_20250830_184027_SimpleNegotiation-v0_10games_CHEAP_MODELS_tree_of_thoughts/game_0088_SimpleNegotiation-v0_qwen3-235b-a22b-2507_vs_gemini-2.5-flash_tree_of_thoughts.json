I need to make it more appealing to Player 0 while still benefiting myself.\n\nLet's try trading away Sheep for Brick.\nOffer: 3 Sheep for 2 Brick.\nValue of 3 Sheep = 3 * 16 = 48.\nValue of 2 Brick = 2 * 28 = 56.\nThis would increase my value by 8. This might be acceptable to Player 0 if they don't value Brick highly, but unlikely since Brick is high value.\n\nLet's try trading away Wheat and Wood for something I value more.\nPlayer 0 probably has different resource quantities and needs.\n\nLet's offer some of my abundant lower-value resources.\nI have 25 Wood and 25 Sheep.\nPlayer 0 made no new trade offer, so I don't know what they have or want.\n\nConsider a balanced offer that still benefits me:\nOffer: 6 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore.\nValue of 6 Wood + 2 Sheep = 6*9 + 2*16 = 54 + 32 = 86.\nValue of 1 Ore = 35.\nThis is not good for Player 0.\n\nI need to offer something Player 0 might want.\nPerhaps they are low on Wood or Sheep or Brick.\n\nLet's try to get some high-value resources.\nI will offer a mix of my low and medium value resources.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Brick]\nMy gain: 3*28 - (8*6 + 5*9) = 84 - (48 + 45) = 84 - 93 = -9. (Loss for me!)\n\nI need to formulate an offer that gives me good value.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore.\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore]\nValue of 5 Sheep + 3 Wood = 5*16 + 3*9 = 80 + 27 = 107\nValue of 2 Ore = 2*35 = 70\nThis is not a good offer for Player 0.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]\nValue of 4 Sheep + 2 Wood = 4*16 + 2*9 = 64 + 18 = 82\nValue of 1 Brick = 28\nStill not good for Player 0.\n\nI need to propose something that offers Player 0 *more* value than what they give me, or similar value, in the hope that my requested resources are more strategic for me.\n\nLet's consider that Player 0 might be valuing different resources.\nI have a surplus of Wood and Sheep.\nPlayer 0 didn't make an offer, so I have to guess.\n\nLet's propose something where I give a bit more value than I receive, but the resources I get are what I want.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue given by me: 3*16 + 2*6 = 48 + 12 = 60\nValue requested by me: 1*35 = 35\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nI need to make an offer that improves my total value.\n\nLet's target getting Brick.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\nMy value change: 2*28 - 3*16 = 56 - 48 = +8.\nThis is a small gain for me, but it's a gain. It gives Player 0 48 value for 56 value. It's a loss for Player 0, so probably not accepted.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood.\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep]\nMy value change: (2*6 + 1*16) - 5*9 = (12 + 16) - 45 = 28 - 45 = -17. Losing value.\n\nI must make an offer that increases my worth.\n\nLet's assume Player 0 might value Sheep less, or Brick or Ore more.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\nMy requested value: 2 * 28 = 56\nMy offered value: 4 * 16 = 64\nThis is a loss of 8 for me.\n\nOkay, I need to be careful with the value analysis.\nValue of (Requested Resources) - Value of (Offered Resources) must be > 0 for me.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore.\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\nMy gain will be - (5 * 16) + (2 * 28) = -80 + 56 = -24. Bad.\n\nWhat if I give up high-value resources for higher-value resources?\nI have 19 Brick and 19 Ore. But I want more of these.\n\nLet's rethink. I have lots of Wood and Sheep.\nI want to get more Brick and Ore.\nMy Wheat is 12, value 6. My Wood is 25, value 9. My Sheep is 25, value 16. My Brick is 19, value 28. My Ore is 19, value 35.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 4 Wood -> 1 Brick]\nValue of 1 Brick = 28.\nValue of 2 Sheep + 4 Wood = 2*16 + 4*9 = 32 + 36 = 68.\nThis would be 28 - 68 = -40 for me. Big loss.\n\nI need to be aiming for a positive value difference for myself.\nIt's possible Player 0 has a different resource distribution and wants something I have.\n\nLet's try a very modest gain for me.\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nMy value change: 1*28 - 2*16 = 28 - 32 = -4. Still a loss for me.\n\nThis is harder than it seems to make an offer that slightly benefits me and might be acceptable to the opponent.\n\nLet's consider the relative values:\nWheat: 6\nWood: 9\nSheep: 16\nBrick: 28\nOre: 35\n\nApproximate ratios:\nOre/Sheep = 35/16 = 2.18\nOre/Brick = 35/28 = 1.25\nBrick/Sheep = 28/16 = 1.75\nSheep/Wood = 16/9 = 1.77\nWood/Wheat = 9/6 = 1.5\n\nIf I offer N Sheep and ask for M Brick such that N*16 < M*28.\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick] is (32 for 28) - lost 4.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick] is (48 for 28) - lost 20.\nNo, 3 Sheep is too much for 1 Brick.\n\nI need to consider what Player 0 might need. Player 0 has no resources from the previous turn.\nThis means Player 0 just started their game, they don't have any resources yet.\nWait, \"Player 0 made no new trade offer.\" This phrasing doesn't mean they have no resources. It means it's my turn to make an offer.\n\nI will try to make a value-neutral (for Player 0) or slightly costly (for Player 0) offer that is good for me.\nLet's try to get Ore.\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered by me: 2*16 + 1*9 = 32 + 9 = 41\nValue received by me: 1*35 = 35\nStill negative for me (-6).\n\nThis is tricky. I need to get rid of low value items and acquire high value items.\n\n[Offer: 12 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 5 Brick]\nValue Offered: 12*6 + 10*9 = 72 + 90 = 162\nValue Requested: 5*28 = 140\nStill a loss for me (-22).\n\nI need to focus on a trade where I get more value than I give.\n\nHow about giving up only Sheep for Ore?\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 3*16 = 48\nValue received: 1*35 = 35\nLoss for me (-13).\n\nOkay, let's target getting Brick or Ore, giving a mix of Sheep, Wood, and Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wood, 10 Wheat, 5 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\nValue offered: 10*9 + 10*6 + 5*16 = 90 + 60 + 80 = 230\nValue received: 3*35 = 105\nHUGE loss for me.\n\nThe issue is that 1 Ore is 35, 1 Brick is 28.\nWheat is 6. Wood is 9. Sheep is 16.\n\nLet's assume Player 0 also wants to increase their value.\n\nI'm thinking about what could be a plausible \"yes\".\nMaybe a trade that's slightly negative for Player 0, but gives them a resource they need.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 3 Wheat, 3 Sheep]\nMy given value: 10 * 9 = 90\nMy received value: 3*6 + 3*16 = 18 + 48 = 66\nLoss for me.\n\nI need to be strategic.\nI have a lot of Wood and Sheep.\n1. Trade Sheep for Brick: If I offer 1 Sheep (val 16) for 1 Brick (val 28), it's a gain of 12. But Player 0 would never accept (losing 12 value).\n2. Trade Sheep for Ore: If I offer 1 Sheep (val 16) for 1 Ore (val 35), it's a gain of 19. Player 0 loses 19.\n\nI need to calculate the offer such that my gain is positive, AND there's a plausible reason for Player 0 to accept.\nThe most likely scenario for Player 0 to accept is if they get something they need or if the value difference is minimal.\n\nLet's aim for a small positive gain for me.\nWhat if I offer a mix of lower values for Brick?\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nOffered: 3*9 + 3*6 = 27 + 18 = 45\nRequested: 1*28 = 28\nThis is a loss for me (-17).\n\nI need to construct the offer the other way around.\nI NEED to gain value.\n\nLet's try to offload Wheat for something else.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Wood]\nMy gain: 2*9 - 5*6 = 18 - 30 = -12. Loss.\n\nOkay, I need to make sure my requested value is greater than my offered value.\nExample: I want 1 Ore (Value 35).\nWhat can I offer that is less than 35 value?\n- 2 Sheep (32) + 1 Wood (9) = 41 (too much)\n- 2 Sheep (32) (too little for Player 0 to accept)\n- 1 Sheep (16) + ?\n- 2 Wood (18) + 2 Wheat (12) = 30.\nThis would be a gain of 35-30 = 5 for me.\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 2*9 + 2*6 = 18 + 12 = 30\nValue received: 1*35 = 35\nThis looks like a good offer for me. I gain 5 value.\nThe opponent would lose 5 value. This is a reasonable loss for an opponent if they are in need of something.\nI have plenty of Wood and Wheat.\n\nLet's try this one.\nMy current resources: 12 Wheat, 25 Wood, 25 Sheep, 19 Brick, 19 Ore.\nI have 12 Wheat and 25 Wood. I can make this trade.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
