Since I no longer have Wheat, I need to reassess my strategy.\n\n3. **New Trade Offer**: I should consider trading resources I have in abundance or those that are less valuable to me for resources that are more valuable or scarce.\n\n4. **Resource Valuation**:\n   - The total value of my current resources is calculated as follows: (0 * 5) + (17 * 8) + (15 * 17) + (8 * 20) + (8 * 38) = 0 + 136 + 255 + 160 + 304 = 855.\n   - I should look for trades that increase this total value.\n\n5. **Potential Trades**:\n   - I can offer some of my less valuable resources (in terms of quantity or value per unit) to gain more valuable ones.\n   - One potential trade could involve offering some Wood (Value: 8) or Sheep (Value: 17) for more valuable resources like Ore (Value: 38), Brick (Value: 20), or other resources that could potentially increase my total value.\n\n6. **Trade Proposal**:\n   - Considering the values, a reasonable trade could be offering some Sheep or Wood for Ore or Brick. However, I already have a significant amount of Ore, so acquiring more Ore might not be the priority unless it's at a very favorable rate.\n   - Let's consider offering Wood for Brick or Sheep for Brick since Brick is valuable and I already have a moderate amount of it.\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nLet's make a new trade offer: Offering 5 Wood for 1 Brick.\n\n- **[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Brick]**\n\nThis trade slightly reduces my Wood quantity but increases my Brick quantity, potentially increasing my total resource value.\n\n```plaintext\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 0 Ore -> 1 Brick, 0 Sheep]\n```\nHowever, to follow the format strictly as requested:\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
