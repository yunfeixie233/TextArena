It seems Player 0 has excess Wood and should consider trading it effectively.\n\nNext Action:\nPlayer 0 can make a new offer. I will propose to Player 1 the following trade:\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]\n\nThis offer aims to strengthen Player 0\u2019s Ore, which is relatively more valuable, and it leverages the surplus of Wood that Player 0 has.\n\nLet's make that offer: \n\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
