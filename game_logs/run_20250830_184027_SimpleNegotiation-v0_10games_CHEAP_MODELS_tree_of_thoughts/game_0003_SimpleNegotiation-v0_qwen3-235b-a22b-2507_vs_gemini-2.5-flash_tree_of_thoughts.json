I want to increase my valuable resources (Brick and Ore) and/or get rid of less valuable ones (Wheat, Wood, Sheep).\n\nLet's try to get more Ore or Brick.\n\nI have a lot of Ore (17) and Sheep (12). I also have a decent amount of Brick (10). Wheat (7) and Wood (9) are lower in quantity and value.\n\nI could try to trade some Wheat, Wood, and Sheep for something of higher value like Ore or Brick.\n\nConsider trading:\n*   3 Wheat (15)\n*   3 Wood (33)\n*   3 Sheep (36)\n**Total Value offered: 84**\n\nWhat do I want in return?\n*   2 Ore (70)\n*   1 Brick (25)\n**Total Value requested: 95**\n\nThis gives me a net gain of 11 (95 - 84). It also reduces my lower valued items and increases my higher valued ones.\n\nMy current inventory allows for this trade:\nWheat: 7 - 3 = 4 (ok)\nWood: 9 - 3 = 6 (ok)\nSheep: 12 - 3 = 9 (ok)\nOre: 17 + 2 = 19 (ok)\nBrick: 10 + 1 = 11 (ok)\n\nThis seems like a reasonable counter-offer that benefits me.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 3 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]",
