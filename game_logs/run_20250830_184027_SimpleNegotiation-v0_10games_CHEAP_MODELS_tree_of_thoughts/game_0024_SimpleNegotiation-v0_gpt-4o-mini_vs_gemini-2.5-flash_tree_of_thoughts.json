Ore has a high value but is less versatile in trades. On the other hand, Brick has a good value but may be more useful as a trading commodity since it\u2019s used in construction and can be appealing to players who are looking to build or upgrade facilities.\n\nI could offer a combination of Ore and Sheep as they provide high value, and in exchange, I will ask for Brick, which has a medium to high value that can help maintain my resources' total worth.\n\n**Let\u2019s draft my initial trade offer:**\n\n- **Offer**: 3 Sheep and 2 Ore (total value of 3 * 18 + 2 * 36 = 54 + 72 = 126)\n- **Request**: 5 Brick (total value of 5 * 23 = 115)\n\nAlthough the value request is slightly lower than the value offered, I believe the player may accept because they might have more Brick than they need and may want the Ore for future constructions. \n\nThus, my trade offer would be:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick] \n\nI'll be ready to proceed once I have my opponent's response.",
