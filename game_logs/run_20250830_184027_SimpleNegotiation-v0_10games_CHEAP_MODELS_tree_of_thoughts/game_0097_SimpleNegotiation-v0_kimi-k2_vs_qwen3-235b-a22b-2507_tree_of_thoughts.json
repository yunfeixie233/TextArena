I am now shortest on Wood (only 5). Wood has the lowest absolute value (45), so I can comfortably spare others if needed.  \n2. Brick has become abundant (24). Its marginal value remains second-highest, so I rarely want to give it away.  \n3. Ore remains scarce and highest-valued\u2014keep it.  \n\nI\u2019ll aim to convert surplus Wheat (27) and Sheep (20, still plenty) into items whose marginal value is higher, ideally Ore since Stone\u2019s 33 dwarfs Wheat\u2019s 6 and Sheep\u2019s 14.\n\nSample 1:1 calculation  \n3 Wheat vs 1 Ore \u2192 net gain = 33-18 = 15 per Ore.  \n2 Sheep vs 1 Ore \u2192 net gain = 33-28 = 5 per Ore.  \nThus the most value-density comes from exchanging Wheat\u2192Ore.\n\nConstruct an offer that looks sizable but keeps proportion modest so Player 1 might accept. I\u2019ll offer 6 Wheat (marginals = 6) and request 2 Ore (marginals = 33 each). My net gain is 2\u00d733 \u2013 6\u00d76 = 66 \u2013 36 = 30. From Player 1\u2019s perspective their gain is +6\u00d76 for giving up only 2\u00d733\u2014unlikely, so I\u2019ll sweeten it a bit.\n\nTry the smallest round:  \n4 Wheat for 1 Ore. Net to me: +27. Net to opponent \u201327, still bad for them.\n\nReverse angle: I have Brick surplus. Let\u2019s instead offer Brick (high marginal) for Ore (even higher). A modest overpay may help.\n\n2 Brick \u2192 1 Ore  \nMy net loss = 33 \u2013 2\u00d726 = \u201319 (no go).  \n\nBrick\u2019s value too close to Ore, no room for mutual gain that way. Alternative: look for their Wood shortage.\n\nSince Player 1 just received 7 Wood, they are no longer desperate for Wood. I\u2019ll pivot: offer Sheep (their possible use) for Ore.\n\nI\u2019ll offer 2 Sheep for 1 Ore. Mutually, I gain +19. They lose 33 \u2013 28 = 5, which is still negative for them but quite small loss, maybe acceptable as convenience. It\u2019s still likely rejected.\n\nBalanced proposal to make the trade look even:  \nOffer 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat for 1 Ore. Sum: 6+14=20 vs 33 \u2192 I still gain 13, they lose 13. Stingy.\n\nAnother avenue: trade Wood for Brick. I am very low on Wood and high on Brick. That seems backward\u2014Brick\u2019s marginal 26 vs Wood 9, hence Brick worth almost triple. I should not swap Brick for Wood.\n\nConclusion: highest bid that still leaves me with value surplus is 5 Wheat for 1 Ore. Net gain: 33\u201330 = 3 (tiny, but still positive for me). That feels borderline but fair round number.\n\nDecision: propose 5 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
