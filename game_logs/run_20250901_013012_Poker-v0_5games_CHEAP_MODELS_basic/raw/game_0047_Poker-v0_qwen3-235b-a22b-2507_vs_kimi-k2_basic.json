      "response": "[Player 0] [Bet 490]  \nPlayer 0 goes all-in for 490 chips on the turn.  \nBoard: J\u2660 K\u2666 5\u2665 3\u2665  \nPot: 880 \u2192 1370 after bet  \nCurrent bet: 490  \n\nMy hand: A\u2666 J\u2663  \nI have top pair, second kicker (A-J) on a board with J\u2660 K\u2666 5\u2665 3\u2665.  \n\n- The turn card (3\u2665) didn\u2019t improve my hand directly, but no obvious flush or straight is completed.  \n- I have top pair with good kicker, but now face an all-in bet.  \n- Given the previous action:  \n  - Pre-flop: I called with A\u2666 J\u2663 in BB.  \n  - Flop: Villain bet 120 into 40 (3/4 pot), I raised to 420, and they called.  \n    - That flop raise likely represents hands like K-x, strong J-x (A-J, K-J), sets, or bluffs.  \n  - Turn: They lead-shove for 490 into 880 (about 56% pot), which is an odd sizing \u2014 suggests either a strong value hand or a semi-bluff with draws.\n\nConsidering range analysis:  \nVillain\u2019s flop call after a 3x raise suggests they have a strong hand \u2014 likely top pair or better.  \nPossible hands they beat me with:  \n- K-K (set)  \n- K-J (two pair)  \n- J-J (set)  \n- A-K (which I block slightly with A\u2666)  \n- Bluffs that called flop: less likely given sizing  \n\nHands I beat:  \n- Worse K-x (K-10, K-9) \u2014 unlikely they\u2019d call a flop raise  \n- J-x worse than mine (J-10, J-9, etc.) \u2014 again, tenuous after raise  \n- Bluffs like Q-10, Q-J might have folded  \n\nMoreover, the turn 3\u2665 brings a backdoor flush draw into play, but no direct completion. Villain may be barreling with weak one-pair hands or draws.  \n\nBut their line (calling flop raise, then shoving turn) is very strong.  \n\nI have 630 chips, and need to call 490 more to win 1370 \u2192 pot odds ~1.5:1.  \nI need ~38% equity to call.  \n\nVs. a balanced range of value and bluffs, I may be near the bottom of my range.  \nHowever:  \n- I have weak showdown value \u2014 only A-J on a K-high board.  \n- There are few hands I clearly beat that would shove here.  \n- K-J, K-K, A-K all beat me.  \n- J-J beats me.  \n- Sets beat me.  \n\nEven though I have top pair, the board texture and Villain\u2019s aggression suggest I\u2019m behind.  \n\n**Decision: Fold.**  \n\n[Fold]",
