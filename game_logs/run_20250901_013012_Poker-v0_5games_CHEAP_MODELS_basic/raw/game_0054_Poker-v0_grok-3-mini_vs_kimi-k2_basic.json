I have the pair of tens which is already a strong 2-player range. I\u2019m out of position in the small-blind, but my opponent just completed for 10, so he checked back his option. By the numbers T\u2663 T\u2666 is miles ahead of a random checking range \u2013 typically 70\u201380 % equity. The pot is 30 and there\u2019s no bet to call.\n\nAction: bet for value and protection, targeting any overs or draw-heavy portion of Villain\u2019s wide range. 33 chips is one-pot sizing on the flop-equivalent, will fold most garbage yet allow draws and smaller pairs to continue.\n\n[Bet 33]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 33.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 43 | Current bet: 33\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 890.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1067.00 chips | bet 33.00 | active\nYour hole: 2\u2665, 9\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 43 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 870.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1100.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 9\u2666, Q\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] [Raise 40]\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 60.\n[Player 1] [Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 50.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [K\u2665, A\u2665, 8\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 830.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1050.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 9\u2666, Q\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] [Check]\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1]   Flopped top-pair with the second\u2013best two-spot kicker on a rainbow board. It\u2019s strong enough to value-bet for protection against hands with over-card draws (like QJ, QT, 9T\u2026) and unavoidable Ax he\u2019ll have plenty of. A flop probe should be around \u2154 pot (80) to fold out the missing equity from QJ/Qx and charge his broad-way floats correctly.  \n\n[Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 200 | Current bet: 80\nVisible board: [K\u2665, A\u2665, 8\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 830.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 80.00 | active\nYour hole: 9\u2666, Q\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 200 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 820.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1150.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 8\u2666, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Game-GTP6][Hand 7] A\u2663 5\u2660 is a premium heads-up holding.
