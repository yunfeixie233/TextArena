The simplest and least costly choice with this weak hand is to fold and wait for better spots.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 960.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1010.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] \nI am the dealer and the big blind. I have already posted 10 chips. Player 1 is the small blind and has posted 20 chips, so the current bet to match is 20 chips. I have 960 chips remaining.\n\nMy hole cards: A\u2660 6\u2660. This is a suited Ace, which is a strong starting hand in heads-up play, especially when against a small blind who tends to limp. While A6s is not a premium hand like AA or KK, it offers good potential for strong flushes, top pair with a good kicker, and sometimes straights.\n\nGiven my position (in-position post-flop if I call, as the dealer), and the strength of A6s, I have a few options:\n\n1.  **Call (20 chips):** This is a reasonable option to see a flop cheaply with a good speculative hand.\n2.  **Raise (e.g., 60-70 chips):** This would be an isolation raise, trying to either win the pot now or play a post-flop hand against a single opponent with a stronger range. Given the villain's previous folds, raising can be effective to take down pots immediately. If called, I have a good hand to play in position.\n\nConsidering the Villain's previous actions of consistently folding to any bet/raise, a raise for value seems appropriate here. Raising will either win the pot outright or allow me to play a strong hand in position. I'll raise to 60, making the total bet 60 for me (an additional 50 on top of my 10 blind). This sets the pot at 90 (60 from me, 20 from villain's SB, 10 from my BB for a total commitment of 60 if villain folds, and villain would have to put in 40 more to call my 60).\n\n[Raise 60]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 80.\n[Player 0]   \nI hold K\u2663 Q\u2660 (offsuit) out of position as the big-blind. The pot is 90 and I must call an additional 70 to continue (already have 10 in the pot, so **call 70** total). Effective stacks if I call will be ~890 (960\u221270), giving a stack-to-pot ratio ~9.9, reasonably playable.\n\n- Equity vs a typical SB heads-up raise range (top ~40%): KQo is around 55\u201360% raw pre-flop equity against his linear/merged raising range.  \n- Position: I act first post-flop, but we\u2019re heads-up, so I won\u2019t always be forced to check-fold; I can lead on favourable boards or check-call as needed.  \n- Fold equity or pre-flop 4-bet bluffing: Not ideal with KQo; it\u2019s strong enough to see a flop and realize equity rather than turn it into a pure bluff.  \n- Commitment: 70 into the current 90 pot is ~44% of pot; it\u2019s not a large fraction of my stack, so I\u2019m not pot-committed and can still fold on bad flops.\n\nGiven the reasonable equity in position and the deep stack, the correct play is to **call** and see the flop.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 70.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 160 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [A\u2665, 8\u2663, 7\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 890.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  \nI am the small blind. The pot is 160 chips. The board is A\u2665 8\u2663 7\u2660. My hole cards are A\u2660 6\u2660.\nThis flop gives me top pair, top kicker (on this board), with a backdoor flush draw (spades). This is a very strong hand given the board. Player 0 has checked.\n\nWith such a strong hand, I want to extract value.

Calling is an option to see a flop, but the stack-to-pot ratio (990:30 \u2248 33:1) is deep enough that post-flop play will be difficult to realize our equity, especially whiffing flops most of the time.\n\nGiven the poor holding and being out of position, the prudent action is to minimize losses and not inflate a pot I\u2019m unlikely to win.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1000.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2660, Q\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  I\u2019m now the small-blind (SB) and have already put in the additional 10 to complete the small blind (plus the original 10, so 20 total). Player 1 (the big-blind) has only posted the mandatory 10-chip blind, so the current live bet I must decide on is 20.\n\nHole cards: 5\u2660 6\u2666  \nThis is an off-suit, low, one-gap connector. In heads-up play, especially when stacks are deep (970 behind, pot 30, SPR \u2248 32:1), 56o is still a very marginal holding:\n\n- Dominated by any bigger straight draw or pair.  \n- Out of position against a wide range the big-blind will defend (because it\u2019s heads-up and they\u2019ve only posted 10).  \n- Reverse-implied-odds hands\u2014when we hit a straight, we could still be behind to bigger straights.\n\nBecause the pot is 30 and I\u2019ve already invested 20 (dead money from dead SB after blind posting), electing to call or raise 56o is slightly negative EV. The simplest and least costly choice with this weak hand is to fold and wait for better spots.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 960.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1010.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] \nI am the dealer and the big blind. I have already posted 10 chips. Player 1 is the small blind and has posted 20 chips, so the current bet to match is 20 chips. I have 960 chips remaining.\n\nMy hole cards: A\u2660 6\u2660. This is a suited Ace, which is a strong starting hand in heads-up play, especially when against a small blind who tends to limp. While A6s is not a premium hand like AA or KK, it offers good potential for strong flushes, top pair with a good kicker, and sometimes straights.\n\nGiven my position (in-position post-flop if I call, as the dealer), and the strength of A6s, I have a few options:\n\n1.  **Call (20 chips):** This is a reasonable option to see a flop cheaply with a good speculative hand.\n2.  **Raise (e.g., 60-70 chips):** This would be an isolation raise, trying to either win the pot now or play a post-flop hand against a single opponent with a stronger range. Given the villain's previous folds, raising can be effective to take down pots immediately. If called, I have a good hand to play in position.\n\nConsidering the Villain's previous actions of consistently folding to any bet/raise, a raise for value seems appropriate here. Raising will either win the pot outright or allow me to play a strong hand in position. I'll raise to 60, making the total bet 60 for me (an additional 50 on top of my 10 blind). This sets the pot at 90 (60 from me, 20 from villain's SB, 10 from my BB for a total commitment of 60 if villain folds, and villain would have to put in 40 more to call my 60).\n\n[Raise 60]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 80.\n[Player 0]   \nI hold K\u2663 Q\u2660 (offsuit) out of position as the big-blind. The pot is 90 and I must call an additional 70 to continue (already have 10 in the pot, so **call 70** total). Effective stacks if I call will be ~890 (960\u221270), giving a stack-to-pot ratio ~9.9, reasonably playable.\n\n- Equity vs a typical SB heads-up raise range (top ~40%): KQo is around 55\u201360% raw pre-flop equity against his linear/merged raising range.  \n- Position: I act first post-flop, but we\u2019re heads-up, so I won\u2019t always be forced to check-fold; I can lead on favourable boards or check-call as needed.  \n- Fold equity or pre-flop 4-bet bluffing: Not ideal with KQo; it\u2019s strong enough to see a flop and realize equity rather than turn it into a pure bluff.  \n- Commitment: 70 into the current 90 pot is ~44% of pot; it\u2019s not a large fraction of my stack, so I\u2019m not pot-committed and can still fold on bad flops.\n\nGiven the reasonable equity in position and the deep stack, the correct play is to **call** and see the flop.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 70.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 160 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [A\u2665, 8\u2663, 7\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 890.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  \nI am the small blind. The pot is 160 chips. The board is A\u2665 8\u2663 7\u2660. My hole cards are A\u2660 6\u2660.\nThis flop gives me top pair, top kicker (on this board), with a backdoor flush draw (spades). This is a very strong hand given the board. Player 0 has checked.\n\nWith such a strong hand, I want to extract value. A check from Player 0 likely means they don't have a strong hand themselves, or they're looking to check-raise. Betting now allows me to build the pot and get value from hands like Ace-x with a worse kicker, an 8, a 7, or even straight/flush draws.\n\nI'll bet for value, a standard c-bet size. I will bet around 1/2 to 2/3 of the pot. Let's go for 80 chips (half of the pot). This leaves me with 870 chips, and Player 0 with 890 chips if they call.\n\n[Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[Player 0]   \nBoard: A\u2665 8\u2663 7\u2660  |  Pot now 240  |  Bet facing me is 80  \nMy hand: K\u2663 Q\u2660 (King-Queen offsuit)\n\nCurrent situation  \n- I have absolutely nothing\u2014neither pair nor flush/straight draw.  \n- Equity with KQo against a flop c-bet of this size is minimal.  \nI need ~25 % equity to call profitably (risk 80 to win 320). Even if villain c-bets wide, my over-cards may be dominated by a hand like AJ or AK, and when I spike one of my six outs (a K or Q), I still might be second-best.  \nDepth is plenty (890 behind), so folding doesn\u2019t threaten the stack; any future bluff/semibluff requires more aggression than my mere over-cards warrant.\n\nBest line is to abandon the pot now and preserve chips.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 240 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 870.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1100.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 2\u2666, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   \nHole cards: 5\u2665 9\u2660  \nCurrent action: I\u2019m in the small blind. The pot is 30 and I have already contributed 20. Villain (BB) has only posted his 10 big blind, so the bet facing me is an additional 10 chips to limp (call), or I could raise and try to take it down.\n\nPre-flop analysis  \n- 95o off-suit and nearly unconnected; one of the weakest holdings.  \n- Heads-up, standard raise ranges for the big-blind defense are super wide, so we\u2019d risk getting called by hands that dominate us (T-7+, any two broadway, any ace, etc.).  \n- SPR (stack-to-pot) is ~29 post-limp (870 behind), meaning post-flop playability is irrelevant because we have almost no equity even with max implied odds.\n\nRaising (e.g., to 60\u201370) has minimal fold equity against the wide BB defend range and leaves us weak-streeted in position that\u2019s essentially the dealer when heads-up.  \n\nThe cheapest and lowest-EV-losing move is to fold the 95o pre-flop.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 860.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1110.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2665, A\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] \nI am the small blind, with 1110 chips left. Player 0 is the big blind, with 860 chips. I have already posted 20 chips, and Player 0 has posted 10 chips to the pot, making the current pot 30. The current bet to match is 20, meaning Player 0 would have to add 10 more chips to call.\n\nMy hole cards: 5\u2665 A\u2660. This is an Ace with a weak kicker, suited. Suited aces are generally good hands in heads-up play, as they can hit strong flushes and top pairs. While A5s is on the weaker side of suited aces, it still has decent playability, especially in position.\n\nConsidering Player 0's previous actions of consistently folding, raising seems like a profitable strategy to either take down the pot uncontested or play a hand in position. Raising allows me to build the pot when I have a strong hand, and this hand, while not premium, plays well.\n\nI will raise to make it 60 chips. This is 3 times the big blind, a standard opening raise size. This will either win the pot now, or give me a chance to play a good hand in position.\n\n[Raise 60]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 80.\n[Player 0]   \nHolding 7\u26657\u2660 in the big-blind vs a SB raise.  \nPot 90, need 70 more to call \u2192 effective stacks 780 after call (SPR \u2248 8.7).  \n\n- 77 is a strong pair heads-up; vs typical SB opening range (~40 %) our equity is ~63 %.  \n- Villain has been very active, so 3-betting for value is viable, but 77 is also strong enough to flat-call and keep in dominated over-cards while disguising our hand.  \n- Post-flop playability: we\u2019ll have position, hit ~12 % of flops with a set, and can play medium-low board favorably.  \n\nOptimal line: flat-call to keep pot under control and realize full equity.  \n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 70.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 160 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [A\u2663, A\u2665, J\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 790.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1050.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2665, A\u2660\n==============================================",

The simplest and least costly choice with this weak hand is to fold and wait for better spots.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 960.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1010.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] \nI am the dealer and the big blind. I have already posted 10 chips. Player 1 is the small blind and has posted 20 chips, so the current bet to match is 20 chips. I have 960 chips remaining.\n\nMy hole cards: A\u2660 6\u2660. This is a suited Ace, which is a strong starting hand in heads-up play, especially when against a small blind who tends to limp. While A6s is not a premium hand like AA or KK, it offers good potential for strong flushes, top pair with a good kicker, and sometimes straights.\n\nGiven my position (in-position post-flop if I call, as the dealer), and the strength of A6s, I have a few options:\n\n1.  **Call (20 chips):** This is a reasonable option to see a flop cheaply with a good speculative hand.\n2.  **Raise (e.g., 60-70 chips):** This would be an isolation raise, trying to either win the pot now or play a post-flop hand against a single opponent with a stronger range. Given the villain's previous folds, raising can be effective to take down pots immediately. If called, I have a good hand to play in position.\n\nConsidering the Villain's previous actions of consistently folding to any bet/raise, a raise for value seems appropriate here. Raising will either win the pot outright or allow me to play a strong hand in position. I'll raise to 60, making the total bet 60 for me (an additional 50 on top of my 10 blind). This sets the pot at 90 (60 from me, 20 from villain's SB, 10 from my BB for a total commitment of 60 if villain folds, and villain would have to put in 40 more to call my 60).\n\n[Raise 60]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 80.\n[Player 0]   \nI hold K\u2663 Q\u2660 (offsuit) out of position as the big-blind.

Effective stacks if I call will be ~890 (960\u221270), giving a stack-to-pot ratio ~9.9, reasonably playable.\n\n- Equity vs a typical SB heads-up raise range (top ~40%): KQo is around 55\u201360% raw pre-flop equity against his linear/merged raising range.  \n- Position: I act first post-flop, but we\u2019re heads-up, so I won\u2019t always be forced to check-fold; I can lead on favourable boards or check-call as needed.  \n- Fold equity or pre-flop 4-bet bluffing: Not ideal with KQo; it\u2019s strong enough to see a flop and realize equity rather than turn it into a pure bluff.  \n- Commitment: 70 into the current 90 pot is ~44% of pot; it\u2019s not a large fraction of my stack, so I\u2019m not pot-committed and can still fold on bad flops.\n\nGiven the reasonable equity in position and the deep stack, the correct play is to **call** and see the flop.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 70.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 160 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [A\u2665, 8\u2663, 7\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 890.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  \nI am the small blind. The pot is 160 chips. The board is A\u2665 8\u2663 7\u2660. My hole cards are A\u2660 6\u2660.\nThis flop gives me top pair, top kicker (on this board), with a backdoor flush draw (spades). This is a very strong hand given the board. Player 0 has checked.\n\nWith such a strong hand, I want to extract value. A check from Player 0 likely means they don't have a strong hand themselves, or they're looking to check-raise. Betting now allows me to build the pot and get value from hands like Ace-x with a worse kicker, an 8, a 7, or even straight/flush draws.\n\nI'll bet for value, a standard c-bet size. I will bet around 1/2 to 2/3 of the pot. Let's go for 80 chips (half of the pot).

The pot is now 480 chips.\n\nPlayer 0's raise is interesting. Given my extremely strong hand, I want to get as many chips into the pot as possible. This raise could indicate several things from Player 0:\n1.  **A Jack:** Player 0 could have a Jack for two pair (A-A-J-J-x), which is a strong hand on this board.\n2.  **A weaker Ace:** Player 0 could have an Ace with a worse kicker, like A2-A4, trying to extract value.\n3.  **A Seven:** Player 0 could have hit a full house with a pair like 77 (A-A-7-7-x). This is the only hand that could potentially beat me apart from quads or pocket jacks.\n4.  **A bluff or semi-bluff:** Given the board texture, this is less likely but not impossible from a very aggressive player.\n\nMy hand is almost certainly the best. My objective is to extract maximum value. I could just call, which keeps Player 0 in the pot to possibly bet more on the turn. Or I could re-raise.

I have already posted 10 chips. Player 1 is the small blind and has posted 20 chips, so the current bet to match is 20 chips. I have 960 chips remaining.\n\nMy hole cards: A\u2660 6\u2660. This is a suited Ace, which is a strong starting hand in heads-up play, especially when against a small blind who tends to limp. While A6s is not a premium hand like AA or KK, it offers good potential for strong flushes, top pair with a good kicker, and sometimes straights.\n\nGiven my position (in-position post-flop if I call, as the dealer), and the strength of A6s, I have a few options:\n\n1.  **Call (20 chips):** This is a reasonable option to see a flop cheaply with a good speculative hand.\n2.  **Raise (e.g., 60-70 chips):** This would be an isolation raise, trying to either win the pot now or play a post-flop hand against a single opponent with a stronger range. Given the villain's previous folds, raising can be effective to take down pots immediately. If called, I have a good hand to play in position.\n\nConsidering the Villain's previous actions of consistently folding to any bet/raise, a raise for value seems appropriate here. Raising will either win the pot outright or allow me to play a strong hand in position. I'll raise to 60, making the total bet 60 for me (an additional 50 on top of my 10 blind). This sets the pot at 90 (60 from me, 20 from villain's SB, 10 from my BB for a total commitment of 60 if villain folds, and villain would have to put in 40 more to call my 60).\n\n[Raise 60]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 90 | Current bet: 80\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 960.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 80.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2660, K\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   \nI hold K\u2663 Q\u2660 (offsuit) out of position as the big-blind. The pot is 90 and I must call an additional 70 to continue (already have 10 in the pot, so **call 70** total). Effective stacks if I call will be ~890 (960\u221270), giving a stack-to-pot ratio ~9.9, reasonably playable.\n\n- Equity vs a typical SB heads-up raise range (top ~40%): KQo is around 55\u201360% raw pre-flop equity against his linear/merged raising range.  \n- Position: I act first post-flop, but we\u2019re heads-up, so I won\u2019t always be forced to check-fold; I can lead on favourable boards or check-call as needed.  \n- Fold equity or pre-flop 4-bet bluffing: Not ideal with KQo; it\u2019s strong enough to see a flop and realize equity rather than turn it into a pure bluff.  \n- Commitment: 70 into the current 90 pot is ~44% of pot; it\u2019s not a large fraction of my stack, so I\u2019m not pot-committed and can still fold on bad flops.\n\nGiven the reasonable equity in position and the deep stack, the correct play is to **call** and see the flop.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 70.\n[Player 1]  \nI am the small blind. The pot is 160 chips. The board is A\u2665 8\u2663 7\u2660. My hole cards are A\u2660 6\u2660.\nThis flop gives me top pair, top kicker (on this board), with a backdoor flush draw (spades). This is a very strong hand given the board. Player 0 has checked.\n\nWith such a strong hand, I want to extract value. A check from Player 0 likely means they don't have a strong hand themselves, or they're looking to check-raise. Betting now allows me to build the pot and get value from hands like Ace-x with a worse kicker, an 8, a 7, or even straight/flush draws.\n\nI'll bet for value, a standard c-bet size. I will bet around 1/2 to 2/3 of the pot. Let's go for 80 chips (half of the pot). This leaves me with 870 chips, and Player 0 with 890 chips if they call.\n\n[Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 240 | Current bet: 80\nVisible board: [A\u2665, 8\u2663, 7\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 890.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 870.00 chips | bet 80.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2660, K\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   \nBoard: A\u2665 8\u2663 7\u2660  |  Pot now 240  |  Bet facing me is 80  \nMy hand: K\u2663 Q\u2660 (King-Queen offsuit)\n\nCurrent situation  \n- I have absolutely nothing\u2014neither pair nor flush/straight draw.  \n- Equity with KQo against a flop c-bet of this size is minimal.  \nI need ~25 % equity to call profitably (risk 80 to win 320). Even if villain c-bets wide, my over-cards may be dominated by a hand like AJ or AK, and when I spike one of my six outs (a K or Q), I still might be second-best.  \nDepth is plenty (890 behind), so folding doesn\u2019t threaten the stack; any future bluff/semibluff requires more aggression than my mere over-cards warrant.\n\nBest line is to abandon the pot now and preserve chips.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 240 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 870.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1100.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2665, 9\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   \nHole cards: 5\u2665 9\u2660  \nCurrent action: I\u2019m in the small blind. The pot is 30 and I have already contributed 20. Villain (BB) has only posted his 10 big blind, so the bet facing me is an additional 10 chips to limp (call), or I could raise and try to take it down.\n\nPre-flop analysis  \n- 95o off-suit and nearly unconnected; one of the weakest holdings.  \n- Heads-up, standard raise ranges for the big-blind defense are super wide, so we\u2019d risk getting called by hands that dominate us (T-7+, any two broadway, any ace, etc.).  \n- SPR (stack-to-pot) is ~29 post-limp (870 behind), meaning post-flop playability is irrelevant because we have almost no equity even with max implied odds.\n\nRaising (e.g., to 60\u201370) has minimal fold equity against the wide BB defend range and leaves us weak-streeted in position that\u2019s essentially the dealer when heads-up.  \n\nThe cheapest and lowest-EV-losing move is to fold the 95o pre-flop.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 860.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1110.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 7\u2665, 7\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] \nI am the small blind, with 1110 chips left. Player 0 is the big blind, with 860 chips. I have already posted 20 chips, and Player 0 has posted 10 chips to the pot, making the current pot 30. The current bet to match is 20, meaning Player 0 would have to add 10 more chips to call.\n\nMy hole cards: 5\u2665 A\u2660. This is an Ace with a weak kicker, suited. Suited aces are generally good hands in heads-up play, as they can hit strong flushes and top pairs. While A5s is on the weaker side of suited aces, it still has decent playability, especially in position.\n\nConsidering Player 0's previous actions of consistently folding, raising seems like a profitable strategy to either take down the pot uncontested or play a hand in position. Raising allows me to build the pot when I have a strong hand, and this hand, while not premium, plays well.\n\nI will raise to make it 60 chips. This is 3 times the big blind, a standard opening raise size. This will either win the pot now, or give me a chance to play a good hand in position.\n\n[Raise 60]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 90 | Current bet: 80\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 860.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1050.00 chips | bet 80.00 | active\nYour hole: 7\u2665, 7\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   \nHolding 7\u26657\u2660 in the big-blind vs a SB raise.  \nPot 90, need 70 more to call \u2192 effective stacks 780 after call (SPR \u2248 8.7).  \n\n- 77 is a strong pair heads-up; vs typical SB opening range (~40 %) our equity is ~63 %.  \n- Villain has been very active, so 3-betting for value is viable, but 77 is also strong enough to flat-call and keep in dominated over-cards while disguising our hand.  \n- Post-flop playability: we\u2019ll have position, hit ~12 % of flops with a set, and can play medium-low board favorably.  \n\nOptimal line: flat-call to keep pot under control and realize full equity.  \n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 70.\n[Player 1]   \nI am the small blind. The pot is 160 chips. The board is A\u2663 A\u2665 J\u2660. My hole cards are 5\u2665 A\u2660.\n\nThis flop is extremely good for me. I have tripped aces (A-A-A), effectively unbeatable, and a full house with a 5 kicker (A-A-A-J-5). This is the nuts, or very close to it, given the board. Player 0 has checked.\n\nWith such a strong hand, my goal is to extract maximum value. I want to bet enough to get Player 0 to call, but not so much that I scare them off. Given that Player 0 might have an Ace themselves (though unlikely to have the last Ace in the deck for quads), or a Jack, or a drawing hand, a medium-sized bet is appropriate. I want to build the pot to get as much money in as possible by the river.\n\nI'll bet around 1/2 to 2/3 of the pot. Let's make it 80 chips. This leaves me with 970 chips and Player 0 with 790 chips if they call. This bet is designed to look like a standard continuation bet, encouraging Player 0 to call with a wide range of hands, including top pairs, flush/straight draws (unlikely on this board, but possible), or even just middle pairs.\n\n[Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 240 | Current bet: 80\nVisible board: [A\u2663, A\u2665, J\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 790.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 80.00 | active\nYour hole: 7\u2665, 7\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   \nI have 7\u26657\u2660 on the flop A\u2663 A\u2665 J\u2660.  \nThe board has two aces and an overcard (J) to my pair. My seven full house (Sevens full of Aces) is the third best possible hand\u2014only quads (AAAAX) or pocket Jacks (a higher full house) beat me after the flop. The chance Villain has either of those holdings after 3-betting from the small blind is very small.\n\nTherefore, I have an effective monster: 77 with trips on board. Extracting maximum value is the priority, and the method in out-of-position heads-up play is to disguised-check-raise.\n\nAction plan  \n- Villain just bet 80 into 240. If I flat-call I keep his entire op-Kicker axe range in and leave 790 behind, but a raise now builds a much larger pot on earlier streets when we\u2019re favorite to scoop.  \n- Standard sizing: make it a sizing that looks like \u201cprotection\u201d \u2014 if I raise to \u2248180-220 that still invites a wide range to continue. I\u2019ll balance between pot-committing a portion of his stack without folding out weak holdings.\n\nSizing decision  \nCurrent pot after call = 320. I\u2019ll raise by approximately 160 more, to a total of 240. This puts half of Villain\u2019s remaining stack at risk, and we\u2019re already ahead.\n\n[Raise 160]\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 240.\n[Player 1]  \nI am the small blind. The board is A\u2663 A\u2665 J\u2660. My hole cards are 5\u2665 A\u2660, giving me trips of Aces with a 5 kicker (A-A-A-J-5). This is a virtually unbeatable hand, as only pocket Jacks for a full house (J-J-A-A-A) or quad Aces (A-A-A-A-x) could beat me. Player 0 has raised my 80 chip bet to 240 chips. The pot is now 480 chips.\n\nPlayer 0's raise is interesting. Given my extremely strong hand, I want to get as many chips into the pot as possible. This raise could indicate several things from Player 0:\n1.  **A Jack:** Player 0 could have a Jack for two pair (A-A-J-J-x), which is a strong hand on this board.\n2.  **A weaker Ace:** Player 0 could have an Ace with a worse kicker, like A2-A4, trying to extract value.\n3.  **A Seven:** Player 0 could have hit a full house with a pair like 77 (A-A-7-7-x). This is the only hand that could potentially beat me apart from quads or pocket jacks.\n4.  **A bluff or semi-bluff:** Given the board texture, this is less likely but not impossible from a very aggressive player.\n\nMy hand is almost certainly the best. My objective is to extract maximum value. I could just call, which keeps Player 0 in the pot to possibly bet more on the turn. Or I could re-raise. Re-raising puts more pressure on Player 0, but if they are on a draw or a weaker Ace, I might scare them off.\n\nGiven the strength of my hand, I want to inflate the pot as much as possible. Player 0 has 550 chips remaining. I have 970 chips remaining. My A5s full house (A-A-A-J-5, as my hole cards are A5s and the board has A-A-J) is only vulnerable to quads or Jacks full. It is unlikely that Player 0 has either given their pre-flop call to my raise.\n\nThe best strategy is to re-raise. This allows me to build the pot size and maximize my win. I will raise to commit Player 0 to the pot. A pot-sized raise would be too much. I want to raise to a size that looks like I am trying to extract value from a strong but not completely unbeatable hand. I also want to make sure I am comfortable getting all-in on the river if the board doesn't change.\n\nPlayer 0 put in 240 chips. The pot is 480. If I call, it becomes 720. I will raise again to about 1.5x Player 0's raise. Player 0 raised from 80 to 240, adding 160. I will raise by about 320 on top of 240, making it 560 chips. This is close to a pot-sized raise, but still leaves Player 0 with some chips to commit on subsequent streets.\n\n[Raise 560]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 800.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 1200 | Current bet: 800\nVisible board: [A\u2663, A\u2665, J\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 550.00 chips | bet 240.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 250.00 chips | bet 800.00 | active\nYour hole: 7\u2665, 7\u2660\n==============================================",

The pot is 160 chips. The board is A\u2665 8\u2663 7\u2660. My hole cards are A\u2660 6\u2660.\nThis flop gives me top pair, top kicker (on this board), with a backdoor flush draw (spades). This is a very strong hand given the board. Player 0 has checked.\n\nWith such a strong hand, I want to extract value. A check from Player 0 likely means they don't have a strong hand themselves, or they're looking to check-raise. Betting now allows me to build the pot and get value from hands like Ace-x with a worse kicker, an 8, a 7, or even straight/flush draws.\n\nI'll bet for value, a standard c-bet size. I will bet around 1/2 to 2/3 of the pot. Let's go for 80 chips (half of the pot). This leaves me with 870 chips, and Player 0 with 890 chips if they call.\n\n[Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[Player 0]   \nBoard: A\u2665 8\u2663 7\u2660  |  Pot now 240  |  Bet facing me is 80  \nMy hand: K\u2663 Q\u2660 (King-Queen offsuit)\n\nCurrent situation  \n- I have absolutely nothing\u2014neither pair nor flush/straight draw.  \n- Equity with KQo against a flop c-bet of this size is minimal.  \nI need ~25 % equity to call profitably (risk 80 to win 320). Even if villain c-bets wide, my over-cards may be dominated by a hand like AJ or AK, and when I spike one of my six outs (a K or Q), I still might be second-best.  \nDepth is plenty (890 behind), so folding doesn\u2019t threaten the stack; any future bluff/semibluff requires more aggression than my mere over-cards warrant.\n\nBest line is to abandon the pot now and preserve chips.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 240 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 870.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1100.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 2\u2666, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   \nHole cards: 5\u2665 9\u2660  \nCurrent action: I\u2019m in the small blind. The pot is 30 and I have already contributed 20. Villain (BB) has only posted his 10 big blind, so the bet facing me is an additional 10 chips to limp (call), or I could raise and try to take it down.\n\nPre-flop analysis  \n- 95o off-suit and nearly unconnected; one of the weakest holdings.  \n- Heads-up, standard raise ranges for the big-blind defense are super wide, so we\u2019d risk getting called by hands that dominate us (T-7+, any two broadway, any ace, etc.).  \n- SPR (stack-to-pot) is ~29 post-limp (870 behind), meaning post-flop playability is irrelevant because we have almost no equity even with max implied odds.\n\nRaising (e.g., to 60\u201370) has minimal fold equity against the wide BB defend range and leaves us weak-streeted in position that\u2019s essentially the dealer when heads-up.  \n\nThe cheapest and lowest-EV-losing move is to fold the 95o pre-flop.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 860.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1110.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2665, A\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] \nI am the small blind, with 1110 chips left. Player 0 is the big blind, with 860 chips. I have already posted 20 chips, and Player 0 has posted 10 chips to the pot, making the current pot 30. The current bet to match is 20, meaning Player 0 would have to add 10 more chips to call.\n\nMy hole cards: 5\u2665 A\u2660. This is an Ace with a weak kicker, suited. Suited aces are generally good hands in heads-up play, as they can hit strong flushes and top pairs. While A5s is on the weaker side of suited aces, it still has decent playability, especially in position.\n\nConsidering Player 0's previous actions of consistently folding, raising seems like a profitable strategy to either take down the pot uncontested or play a hand in position. Raising allows me to build the pot when I have a strong hand, and this hand, while not premium, plays well.\n\nI will raise to make it 60 chips. This is 3 times the big blind, a standard opening raise size. This will either win the pot now, or give me a chance to play a good hand in position.\n\n[Raise 60]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 80.\n[Player 0]   \nHolding 7\u26657\u2660 in the big-blind vs a SB raise.  \nPot 90, need 70 more to call \u2192 effective stacks 780 after call (SPR \u2248 8.7).  \n\n- 77 is a strong pair heads-up; vs typical SB opening range (~40 %) our equity is ~63 %.  \n- Villain has been very active, so 3-betting for value is viable, but 77 is also strong enough to flat-call and keep in dominated over-cards while disguising our hand.  \n- Post-flop playability: we\u2019ll have position, hit ~12 % of flops with a set, and can play medium-low board favorably.  \n\nOptimal line: flat-call to keep pot under control and realize full equity.  \n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 70.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 160 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [A\u2663, A\u2665, J\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 790.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1050.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2665, A\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1]   \nI am the small blind. The pot is 160 chips. The board is A\u2663 A\u2665 J\u2660. My hole cards are 5\u2665 A\u2660.\n\nThis flop is extremely good for me. I have tripped aces (A-A-A), effectively unbeatable, and a full house with a 5 kicker (A-A-A-J-5). This is the nuts, or very close to it, given the board. Player 0 has checked.\n\nWith such a strong hand, my goal is to extract maximum value. I want to bet enough to get Player 0 to call, but not so much that I scare them off. Given that Player 0 might have an Ace themselves (though unlikely to have the last Ace in the deck for quads), or a Jack, or a drawing hand, a medium-sized bet is appropriate. I want to build the pot to get as much money in as possible by the river.\n\nI'll bet around 1/2 to 2/3 of the pot. Let's make it 80 chips. This leaves me with 970 chips and Player 0 with 790 chips if they call. This bet is designed to look like a standard continuation bet, encouraging Player 0 to call with a wide range of hands, including top pairs, flush/straight draws (unlikely on this board, but possible), or even just middle pairs.\n\n[Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[Player 0]   \nI have 7\u26657\u2660 on the flop A\u2663 A\u2665 J\u2660.  \nThe board has two aces and an overcard (J) to my pair. My seven full house (Sevens full of Aces) is the third best possible hand\u2014only quads (AAAAX) or pocket Jacks (a higher full house) beat me after the flop. The chance Villain has either of those holdings after 3-betting from the small blind is very small.\n\nTherefore, I have an effective monster: 77 with trips on board. Extracting maximum value is the priority, and the method in out-of-position heads-up play is to disguised-check-raise.\n\nAction plan  \n- Villain just bet 80 into 240. If I flat-call I keep his entire op-Kicker axe range in and leave 790 behind, but a raise now builds a much larger pot on earlier streets when we\u2019re favorite to scoop.  \n- Standard sizing: make it a sizing that looks like \u201cprotection\u201d \u2014 if I raise to \u2248180-220 that still invites a wide range to continue. I\u2019ll balance between pot-committing a portion of his stack without folding out weak holdings.\n\nSizing decision  \nCurrent pot after call = 320. I\u2019ll raise by approximately 160 more, to a total of 240. This puts half of Villain\u2019s remaining stack at risk, and we\u2019re already ahead.\n\n[Raise 160]\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 240.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 480 | Current bet: 240\nVisible board: [A\u2663, A\u2665, J\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 550.00 chips | bet 240.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 80.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2665, A\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  \nI am the small blind. The board is A\u2663 A\u2665 J\u2660. My hole cards are 5\u2665 A\u2660, giving me trips of Aces with a 5 kicker (A-A-A-J-5). This is a virtually unbeatable hand, as only pocket Jacks for a full house (J-J-A-A-A) or quad Aces (A-A-A-A-x) could beat me. Player 0 has raised my 80 chip bet to 240 chips. The pot is now 480 chips.\n\nPlayer 0's raise is interesting. Given my extremely strong hand, I want to get as many chips into the pot as possible. This raise could indicate several things from Player 0:\n1.  **A Jack:** Player 0 could have a Jack for two pair (A-A-J-J-x), which is a strong hand on this board.\n2.  **A weaker Ace:** Player 0 could have an Ace with a worse kicker, like A2-A4, trying to extract value.\n3.  **A Seven:** Player 0 could have hit a full house with a pair like 77 (A-A-7-7-x). This is the only hand that could potentially beat me apart from quads or pocket jacks.\n4.  **A bluff or semi-bluff:** Given the board texture, this is less likely but not impossible from a very aggressive player.\n\nMy hand is almost certainly the best. My objective is to extract maximum value. I could just call, which keeps Player 0 in the pot to possibly bet more on the turn. Or I could re-raise. Re-raising puts more pressure on Player 0, but if they are on a draw or a weaker Ace, I might scare them off.\n\nGiven the strength of my hand, I want to inflate the pot as much as possible. Player 0 has 550 chips remaining. I have 970 chips remaining. My A5s full house (A-A-A-J-5, as my hole cards are A5s and the board has A-A-J) is only vulnerable to quads or Jacks full. It is unlikely that Player 0 has either given their pre-flop call to my raise.\n\nThe best strategy is to re-raise. This allows me to build the pot size and maximize my win. I will raise to commit Player 0 to the pot. A pot-sized raise would be too much. I want to raise to a size that looks like I am trying to extract value from a strong but not completely unbeatable hand. I also want to make sure I am comfortable getting all-in on the river if the board doesn't change.\n\nPlayer 0 put in 240 chips. The pot is 480. If I call, it becomes 720. I will raise again to about 1.5x Player 0's raise. Player 0 raised from 80 to 240, adding 160. I will raise by about 320 on top of 240, making it 560 chips. This is close to a pot-sized raise, but still leaves Player 0 with some chips to commit on subsequent streets.\n\n[Raise 560]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 800.\n[Player 0]   \nI have 7\u26657\u2660 on A\u2663 A\u2665 J\u2660.  \n\nPot is 1200 and I\u2019m facing a raise to 800 that puts Villain ALMOST all-in (he has only 250 chips left).  \nMy actual holding gives me the second-nut full house: Aces full of Sevens. The only hands that beat me are quads (AAAAX\u2014requires pocket Aces) or a higher full house (Jacks full\u2014requires pocket JJ). Both are extremely unlikely after a single pre-flop raise and 3-bet-flop pressure.\n\nGiven Villain has already committed 90 % of his remaining stack (800 out of 1050 at the moment of the raise), folding is not an option\u2014the equity gained by the sight of one more card justifies moving in with the nuts in disguise.\n\nTherefore I\u2019ll put the rest in now to guarantee we see all five cards:\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 550.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 1750 | Current bet: 800\nVisible board: [A\u2663, A\u2665, J\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 0.00 chips | bet 790.00 | all-in\nP1 (SB): 250.00 chips | bet 800.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2665, A\u2660\n==============================================",
