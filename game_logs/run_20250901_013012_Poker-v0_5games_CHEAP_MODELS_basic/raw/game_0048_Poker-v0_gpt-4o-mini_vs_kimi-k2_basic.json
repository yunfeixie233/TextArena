Villain\u2019s BB facing a limp range is wide and still has many Ax, flush draws, made flushes, trips, etc. Betting or raising is unlikely to fold out many better hands.

Villain\u2019s BB facing a limp range is wide and still has many Ax, flush draws, made flushes, trips, etc. Betting or raising is unlikely to fold out many better hands.
