QJo unsuited is comfortably in the top 25 % of all starting hands heads-up. My opponent already posted the small blind and may decide to fold or see a flop cheaply. Given the pot is just 30 and I\u2019m last to act, going for value and building the pot while I most likely have the best hand is the natural plan.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[Player 1] [Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, A\u2665, 6\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2666, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  We saw a Q-high rainbow flop with two diamonds and I have the Q\u2666 for a back-door flush draw plus two over-cards. Unfortunately, my opponent was strong enough to limp behind pre-flop instead of raise/folding, so the A can very well have hit their range. Still, heads-up, QJ-high is often worth betting for value and protection; any pocket pair below ace they might have needs two cards to improve.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1] [Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 20.\n[Player 1] [Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, A\u2665, 6\u2666, 7\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 960.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2666, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  The 7\u2663 on the turn gives me an additional gut-shot straight draw (8-T-K-A for the nuts), in addition to my existing two-live over-cards and the \u2666 back-door flush. While the board keeps getting more coordinated with possible two-pair and straight-draw hands for my opponent, heads-up I still have a substantial amount of equity (up to 22 % vs many aces and kings).  \n\nWith the pot sitting at 80 and both of us around 960 chips deep, enough money is behind that I can semi-bluff effectively. My flop bet got a smooth call, so Villain\u2019s range is still mostly ace-high or middle pocket pairs. A second barrel now\u2014both to fold out middling pairs and to build the pot when I improve\u2014is the strongest line.\n\n[Bet 40]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] [Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 40.\n[Player 1] [Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 160 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, A\u2665, 6\u2666, 7\u2663, A\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 920.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 920.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2666, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  The river is the A\u2666, completing the back-door flush (\u2666\u2666\u2666 on board).  \nMy hand: Q\u2666 J\u2663  \n\n- Possession of Q\u2666 gives me the second-nut flush on this board\u2014only K\u2666x\u2666 beats me. The nut flush is A\u2666K\u2666 (or any two \u2666 containing K\u2666).  \n- Villain checked the river without further aggression. Given the previous two streets of calls, their range is weighted toward single-pair hands or missed draws; most showdown would be ace-high (with non-A\u2666 kickers) or marginal pairs. They would usually bet trips or boats themselves.  \n\nWe now have 160 in the pot with ~920 behind. A value bet targeting ace-high / small pairs is clearly warranted. I\u2019ll choose a sizing that looks callable to those\u2014around half pot.\n\n[Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 80.\n[Player 1] [Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 80.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: Q\u2666 J\u2663\nPlayer 1: 9\u2663 J\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, A\u2665, 6\u2666, 7\u2663, A\u2666\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 320 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1140.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 830.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2666, Q\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  I\u2019m the small blind this hand with Q\u26605\u2666\u2014a very mediocre offsuit hand that is near the bottom of my range heads-up. My first decision is whether to complete (call 10 more), raise, or fold. Against most opponents this hand is a fold because:\n\n\u2022 Q-high 5-kicker rarely wins unimproved.  \n\u2022 Unsuited and gapped, it flops poorly.\n\nWith 1140 chips effective, it\u2019s too weak to spend more. Folding costs only the 10 already posted and preserves my big stack.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1130.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 840.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 2\u2660, Q\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1140.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 830.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, K\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  A\u2660 K\u2666 in the small blind\u2014the premium offsuit hand. Heads-up this is a compulsory raise for value and to build the pot. I\u2019ll size big to apply immediate pressure: 3\u00d7 BB (60 total, so a raise of 40) is standard.\n\n[Raise 40]\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 60.\n[Player 1] [Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 50.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [K\u2665, 9\u2660, J\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 1100.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 780.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, K\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Top pair top kicker with the dreaded Broadway draw present on J-9-x rainbow flop \u2014 but I\u2019ve got the right suit A\u2660 for back-door nut flush and unblock the scoop since I don\u2019t hold the A\u2666. At 120 pot and 1100 effective behind, villain called raise out of position and now checks. C-bet almost mandatory for value/protection against JT, QT, 98 etc.; standard sizing is ~60-70 % of the pot.\n\n[Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 80.\n[Player 1] [Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 280 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [K\u2665, 9\u2660, J\u2666, 2\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 1020.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 700.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, K\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Blank turn, the pot is already 280. I still hold top pair top kicker. No draws complete except the unlikely T8 straight which Villain just called on. With ~700 effective behind, I can and should continue maximally extracting value from hands like QJ, J9, QT, KQ that might now gratefully pay one more bet. Bet sizing for turn is around 60-70 %. I\u2019ll make it 185.\n\n[Bet 185]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 185.\n[Player 1] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 465 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1290.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 680.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 10\u2666, 7\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1300.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 670.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 8\u2666, K\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   I\u2019m the small blind with K\u2665 8\u2666\u2014a solid, offsuit King. Heads-up this is comfortably above break-even, so folding isn\u2019t an option. I have a big chip advantage (1300 vs 670), so every extra chip I can extract is worth more to my opponent than to me.  \n\nOptions:  \n1. Limp: lets the BB see a flop cheaply with a wide range.  \n2. Raise: maximizes fold equity and builds a pot against a shorter stack who is likely to call too wide.\n\nRaising is clearly best. Sizing will be aggressive: 3 BB \u2013\u2013 60 total, which is 40 on top of the 20 SB straddle. If Villain 3-bet shoves their remaining 660 we can snap-call with this hand (K8o has ~51 % vs a random shove and >60 % vs many specific hands they\u2019ll push).\n\n[Raise 40]\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 60.\n[Player 1] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 70 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1320.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 650.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1330.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 640.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  I'm the small blind with J\u2665 2\u2665.  Off-suit jack with weak kicker is not a hand I want to play out of position against an opponent who is already short-stacked (only 640 behind).  Against a standard range that might call pre-flop (and especially against their limping range from the big blind position), I'd have poor equity and marginal post-flop playability.\n\nMy plan is to avoid any extra chip loss: I'll simply muck my hand right now.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1320.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 650.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2665, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1330.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 640.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 8\u2665\n==============================================",
