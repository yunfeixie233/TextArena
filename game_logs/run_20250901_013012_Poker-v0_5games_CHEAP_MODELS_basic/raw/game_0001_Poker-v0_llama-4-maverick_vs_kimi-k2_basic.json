This is a relatively cheap call to see the flop.\n- **[Fold]** means giving up your hand and forfeiting your chance to win the pot. You've already lost 10 chips in the blind.\n- **[Raise]** would mean increasing the bet, putting more pressure on P1. This is a more aggressive action and would require P1 to think about folding or calling/raising back.\n\n**Decision**:\nGiven your hand isn't strong but has some potential, and considering you're already invested in the pot with your big blind, calling the additional 10 chips to see the flop is a reasonable action. It allows you to see how the board develops without committing too many more chips.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`",
