This is weak, but also one of the better hands you credibly hold after having merely completed pre-flop. It\u2019s a small pot, we\u2019re out of position and the board is two-tone with A\u2660 3\u2663.\n\nI\u2019ll lead small to protect equity and see what happens, but not risk much.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1] [Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [6\u2660, A\u2660, 3\u2663, J\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 940.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2663, Q\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   \nThree spades are now on board and I don\u2019t have any. My pair of sixes with Q-kicker is now extremely weak\u2014any spade beats me, any ace beats me, and any jack beats me. My hand is essentially a bluff-catcher with very little showdown value. With the pot already at 80 and my stack at 940, continuation betting again would be a bluff, but it\u2019s unlikely to fold out anything that called the flop and now hits this turn.

My bet on the flop was called, which narrows his range somewhat. The flush draw is live, but I have the K\u2660 block and he checked to me again\u2014suggesting a weaker range.  \n\nThis is a great spot to fire a large turn for value\u2014most worse jacks, flush draws or stubborn floats will continue.
