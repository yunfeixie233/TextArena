The action is back to you to decide whether to call the additional 10 chips (since 10 of the 20 chips bet by P1 is your initial big blind), fold, or raise.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u26656\u2663, which is not a strong starting hand but has some potential with the Jack being a relatively high card.\n   - You've already invested 10 chips in the pot as the big blind.\n   - The small blind has raised, indicating a potentially stronger hand or an attempt to steal the blinds.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - The current bet is 20, and you've already put in 10. So, to call, you need to put in an additional 10 chips.\n   - Given that you're out of position post-flop (since you're the big blind and the dealer), and facing a raise from the small blind, you need to carefully consider your action.\n   - Your hand isn't particularly strong, but calling an additional 10 chips to see a flop might be a reasonable play to gather more information, especially since the pot odds are favorable (pot size is 30, and you're being asked to pay an additional 10).\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - To call the additional 10 chips: `[Call]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 1/10\n    *   Round: Flop\n    *   Pot: 40 chips\n    *   Current bet: 0 chips (meaning no action has been taken yet on the flop)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n    *   Your stack: 980 chips\n    *   Your hand: J\u2663, 4\u2666\n    *   Visible board: 9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663\n\n2.  **Analysis**:\n    *   Your hand (J\u2663, 4\u2666) did not connect with the board in any significant way. You have no pair, no flush draw (you have a club, but only one, and there are three clubs on the board), and no straight draw. The highest card on the board is 9\u2663, and you have a Jack, which is currently your high card.\n    *   Player 0 (P0) is the Dealer/Big Blind (BB), meaning they will act after you on subsequent streets.\n    *   The bet is currently 0, meaning you are the first to act on the flop.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   Given that your hand has missed the flop entirely, and you are out of position, betting into P0 would be a bluff. While bluffing can be a part of poker, it's generally risky when you have no equity and are out of position.\n    *   Checking allows you to see P0's action and potentially another card for free if P0 also checks. This is the most conservative and often correct play when you have a weak hand and no immediate connects.\n    *   It's important not to invest more chips into a hand that has a very low probability of improving or winning at showdown.\n\n4.  **Action**:\n    *   Since the current bet is 0, checking is a valid and prudent option.\n\nThe best action is: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2663, J\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Round: Flop\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Player 0 (P0), Dealer, Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your stack: 980 chips\n   - Your hand: 6\u2663, J\u2665\n   - Visible board: 9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663\n\n2. **Action Required**:\n   As P0, you are first to act on the flop. You need to decide whether to check, bet, or potentially fold if you were to face a bet (though that's not a current option).\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand (J\u2665, 6\u2663) has a potential flush draw with clubs, as you have one club and there are three clubs on the board.\n   - The board is relatively draw-heavy with two clubs already on the board, making it potentially dangerous for a hand that doesn't have a club.\n   - You called pre-flop, so your hand isn't extremely strong but has some potential.\n   - P1 checked, indicating they might not have a strong hand or are choosing not to bet.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Given that you have a flush draw (you have one club, and there are three on the board, so you actually have a club draw but it's a bit complicated since the board already has a possible flush), it's worth considering a bet to:\n     - Protect your hand in case P1 has a club or a draw.\n     - Build the pot if you do hit your flush.\n   - However, since the board is quite draw-heavy and you're not sure what P1 has, a more cautious approach could be to check and see how P1 reacts on the turn.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - A reasonable bet could be around half the pot to start, which is 20 chips.

This is a half-pot bet.\n   - Your hand (J\u2663, 4\u2666) still has not connected with the board.

      "response": "[Player 1] To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 3/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips (from P0 already putting 10 chips as big blind, and you as small blind put 20 chips)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n    *   Your stack: 950 chips\n    *   Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n\n2.  **Action Required**:\n    As P1 (Small Blind), you have posted 20 chips, while P0 (Big Blind) has posted 10 chips. The action is on you to declare your intention of whether to check, raise, or fold. Wait, this cannot be correct. If (P1) is SB, P1 pays 10, and if P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. Then the total pot should be 30. And you are P1(SB), so you just put in 10 chips to be SB. If the current bet is 20, then P0 must have raised it from 20 to 20 or P0 just called it. Since you are the SB and the pot is 30, and you have put in 20 already, P0 has put 10 chips. So P0 must be the BB, and the actual player on action now is P0.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate current player positions and chips.\n    *   Pot: 30 chips (P1 contributed 20 chips, P0 contributed 10 chips)\n    *   P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020 chips (bet 10.00 | active)\n    *   P1 (SB): 950 chips (bet 20.00 | active)\n    *   This means P1 paid the Big Blind (20 chips) and P0 paid the Small Blind (10 chips). And the action is back to P0.\n\n    This setup contradicts the previous hands where P0 was SB and P1 was BB or vice versa. Let's assume the roles are swapped for this hand.\n\n    Let's assume the problem statement means that Player 0 is the SB and Dealer, and Player 1 is the BB and not the dealer. This would mean that P0 has put in 10 chips, and P1 has put in 20 chips. The current bet would be 20 chips because P1 is in the Big Blind position. Since you are P1, you are the Big Blind, you have already put in 20 chips. The action is now on P0 to call, raise, or fold.\n\n    The problem statement specifies \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\". This implies *you* are Player 1.\n    If you are Player 1 (SB), who bet 20 chips, and Player 0 (Dealer/BB) bet 10 chips. The remaining chips, 10, were already contributed by P0.\n    In a classic setup, SB pays 10, BB pays 20. The current bet is 20 for whoever needs to act.\n\n    Let's assume the standard blind structure:\n    - P1 (SB): 10 chips\n    - P0 (BB/Dealer): 20 chips\n\n    The text \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" suggests P1 *is* the Small Blind, but *already bet 20*. This is highly unusual. If P1 is SB, they typically bet 10. If they have bet 20, it implies they raised to 20, and the previous player (P0) called a 10 chip bet, and now P0 is facing a raise to 20.\n\n    Interpretation 1: Standard blinds, but the status read is confusing.\n    - P0 Dealer/BB, P1 SB.\n    - P1 posted 10 (SB).\n    - P0 posted 20 (BB).\n    - P1 has the first action pre-flop after blinds. Pot is 30.\n    - If P1 bet 20, it means P1 raised (from their 10) to 20. So, P1 has already used 20 chips.\n\n    Interpretation 2: Based directly on the provided info, ignoring standard roles if they conflict.\n    - P0 (Dealer/BB): 10.00 chips contributed.\n    - P1 (SB): 20.00 chips contributed.\n    - Current bet: 20.\n    - Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660 (You are P1)\n\n    This means P1 paid 20 (the BB amount) and P0 paid 10 (the SB amount). So P0 is SB and P1 is BB. And P0 is also the Dealer. This means the blinds are reversed from the previous hand, and P1 is indeed the Big Blind.\n    As Big Blind, you have already posted 20 chips. The \"Current bet: 20\" means there has been no raise. The action is now back to Player 0 who is the Small Blind and the Dealer. Player 0 has put in 10, so they need to put in another 10 to call your 20 chip Big Blind.\n\n    So, as P1 (BB), you have already posted your 20 chips, and the action is currently on Player 0, who needs to decide whether to call (an additional 10 to meet your 20), raise, or fold.\n    The prompt \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies the system is waiting for *my* action. This again conflicts with the standard flow where the BB (P1 in this case) acts last pre-flop if no raises occur.\n\n    Let's assume the game is telling me (Player 1) that it's my turn to act, despite being BB, which would only happen if someone *before* me had placed a bet higher than my 20BB. The only player before me (P1 as BB) would be P0 (SB). If P0 bet 20 and I'm at 20, it implies P0 *called* my 20. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\n    Let's re-read the roles and chips:\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n\n    This indicates `P0` is the `Dealer/BB` and has contributed `10`.\n    This indicates `P1` is the `SB` and has contributed `20`.\n    This is a reversal of standard blinds. If P1 is SB, they should contribute 10. If P0 is BB, they should contribute 20.\n    The most logical interpretation for \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\" with \"Current bet: 20\" is that:\n    1. P1 (SB) put in 10 (or was supposed to).\n    2. P0 (BB) put in 20 (or was supposed to). Pot 30.\n    3. Now P1 (SB) is facing the 20 chip \"bet\" (which is the BB amount) from P0 acting as BB.\n    4. P1 has to decide whether to call 10 more chips to match the 20 (total 20 from P1) or raise.\n\n    So, assuming P1 is the SB (10 chips) and P0 is the BB (20 chips) AND P0 is the Dealer.\n    This means the prompt \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" is misrepresenting \"bet 20.00\". It should be \"bet 10.00\" as the SB amount. If it says \"bet 20.00\", it means P1 already put 20 into the pot. This would usually imply that P1 made a raise or the rules are truly unusual.\n\n    Let's rely on the explicit numerical values provided:\n    - You (P1) have made a bet of 20.\n    - P0 has made a bet of 10.\n    - The current highest bet is 20.\n    - The action is on YOU (P1).\n\n    This scenario only makes sense if the blinds are reversed (P1 is BB, P0 is SB) or if P1 (as SB) has already raised to 20, and P0 (as BB) has called 10 (their SB) and now needs to add another 10 to match P1's 20. But the text says P0 is BB (P0 Dealer/BB...bet 10.00) and P1 is SB (P1 SB...bet 20.00).\n\n    This is a contradictory statement in the `[GAME]` output.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    If P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. If P1 is SB, P1 pays 10. The sum of blinds is 30. The pot is 30. The \"Current bet: 20\" refers to the highest required contribution. The player whose turn it is needs to match this.\n\n    Given that \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies I am P1, and \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\", it is most likely that as the SB, I have already *raised* to 20. And P0 (BB) has only put in 10. So P0 actually owes 10 to match my bet of 20.\n    But the context implies I am waiting for *my* action.\n\n    Okay, I will assume the provided raw data is exactly what's to be interpreted, even if it contradicts standard game flow.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): ... bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n    \"Current bet: 20\"\n\n    This means P1 (me, SB) has already put in 20 chips, making the current bet 20. P0 (BB/Dealer) has put in 10 chips. The action is currently on player P0, who needs to match the 20 chip bet.\n    *BUT* if the game is waiting for *my* next action, this implies I am the one who has to make a decision. This can only be true if Player 0 has placed a bet or raise *after* my 20-chip contribution, and I am now facing their action. However, the current bet is still 20, which is what I already contributed.\n\n    This means *I am currently facing a bet of 20 (which is the Big Blind amount).*\n    And \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" means I have already put in 20 chips as SB. This is an unusual situation.\n    The only way this makes sense is if the blind amounts are 20 (SB) and 10 (BB), which is rare but possible, or if the \"bet 20.00\" for P1 is the *total* bet for the round (i.e. P1 raised to 20, and now it's P1's turn).\n\n    Let's assume the blinds are 10 (SB) and 20 (BB).\n    P1 is SB, P0 is BB.\n    P1 posts 10. P0 posts 20. Pot 30.\n    Action is on P1 (SB) to call 10 (to match P0's 20), raise, or fold.\n    In this case, the `bet 20.00` for P1 is the *amount they need to call to bring their total contribution to 20*. So, I've put in 10 chips as SB, and now I need to put in 10 more to call P0's BB of 20 chips.\n\n    3. **Analysis**:\n    - Your hand K\u2666, 7\u2660 is a decent speculative hand. It has high card potential with the King and can make a strong pair if a King hits. There's also a backdoor flush or straight opportunity.\n    - You are the Small Blind (SB), and you've already contributed 10 chips. You are facing the Big Blind's 20-chip bet. To call, you need to add 10 more chips.\n    - This is a standard situation for the small blind.\n\n    4. **Decision**:\n    - With K7s, you are usually looking to play, especially if you can get a good price. Calling 10 chips to see a flop with a hand that has reasonable potential (K high, suitedness, Broadway potential) is often a good play.\n    - Raising would be an option to try to win the blinds immediately or build a bigger pot if you think your hand is strong enough to play for value. However, without knowing P0's tendencies, a call is often safer, especially when out of position post-flop.\n    - Folding would be too conservative for K7s, as you've already invested 10 chips and only need to put in 10 more (1 chip for every 3 in the pot plus your bet).\n\n    5. **Action**:\n    - Call the additional 10 chips to meet the 20 current bet.\n    - To call: `[Call]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Call]`",

So, to call, you need to put in an additional 10 chips.\n   - Given that you're out of position post-flop (since you're the big blind and the dealer), and facing a raise from the small blind, you need to carefully consider your action.\n   - Your hand isn't particularly strong, but calling an additional 10 chips to see a flop might be a reasonable play to gather more information, especially since the pot odds are favorable (pot size is 30, and you're being asked to pay an additional 10).\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - To call the additional 10 chips: `[Call]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 1/10\n    *   Round: Flop\n    *   Pot: 40 chips\n    *   Current bet: 0 chips (meaning no action has been taken yet on the flop)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n    *   Your stack: 980 chips\n    *   Your hand: J\u2663, 4\u2666\n    *   Visible board: 9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663\n\n2.  **Analysis**:\n    *   Your hand (J\u2663, 4\u2666) did not connect with the board in any significant way. You have no pair, no flush draw (you have a club, but only one, and there are three clubs on the board), and no straight draw. The highest card on the board is 9\u2663, and you have a Jack, which is currently your high card.\n    *   Player 0 (P0) is the Dealer/Big Blind (BB), meaning they will act after you on subsequent streets.\n    *   The bet is currently 0, meaning you are the first to act on the flop.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   Given that your hand has missed the flop entirely, and you are out of position, betting into P0 would be a bluff. While bluffing can be a part of poker, it's generally risky when you have no equity and are out of position.\n    *   Checking allows you to see P0's action and potentially another card for free if P0 also checks.

You need to decide whether to check, bet, or potentially fold if you were to face a bet (though that's not a current option).\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand (J\u2665, 6\u2663) has a potential flush draw with clubs, as you have one club and there are three clubs on the board.\n   - The board is relatively draw-heavy with two clubs already on the board, making it potentially dangerous for a hand that doesn't have a club.\n   - You called pre-flop, so your hand isn't extremely strong but has some potential.\n   - P1 checked, indicating they might not have a strong hand or are choosing not to bet.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Given that you have a flush draw (you have one club, and there are three on the board, so you actually have a club draw but it's a bit complicated since the board already has a possible flush), it's worth considering a bet to:\n     - Protect your hand in case P1 has a club or a draw.\n     - Build the pot if you do hit your flush.\n   - However, since the board is quite draw-heavy and you're not sure what P1 has, a more cautious approach could be to check and see how P1 reacts on the turn.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - A reasonable bet could be around half the pot to start, which is 20 chips.

This is a half-pot bet.\n   - Your hand (J\u2663, 4\u2666) still has not connected with the board. You have no pair, no draw, and your high card (Jack) is currently not enough to beat any pair.\n   - P0's bet indicates some strength or a draw.\n   - You previously checked on the flop, signaling weakness or a desire to see a free card.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - You are facing a bet with a very weak hand that has little to no equity.\n   - Calling 20 chips would be investing more into a hand that is highly unlikely to improve or win at showdown.\n   - Raising would be a pure bluff, which is very risky when out of position and with no perceived equity.\n   - Folding is the most prudent action as it minimizes losses in a situation where your hand is clearly behind. It saves your chips for better opportunities.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - Given the lack of any hand value and being out of position, folding is the best option to preserve your stack.\n\nThe best action is: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 60 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2666, Q\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Round: Pre-flop\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Player 0 (P0), Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your stack: 1000 chips (actually 1040 after winning the previous hand, so it should be 1040)\n   - Your hand: K\u2666, Q\u2660\n\n2. **Action Required**:\n   As P0 (Small Blind), you've already posted 10 chips. P1 (Big Blind) has posted 10 chips as well, and the action is on you to decide whether to call, raise, or fold.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is K\u2666, Q\u2660, a relatively strong starting hand with two high cards.\n   - The pot is 30 chips, and to call, you need to put in an additional 10 chips (since you've already contributed 10 as the small blind).\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - With a hand like K\u2666, Q\u2660, it's generally a good idea to play. You could either call the additional 10 chips or raise to build the pot and narrow the field.\n   - Raising pre-flop with strong cards can be beneficial to maximize the pot and protect your hand.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - To call the additional 10 chips: `[Call]` is a reasonable play, but given your strong hand, raising might be a better option to build the pot and disguise your hand strength.\n   - A standard raise would be to make it 2-3 times the big blind. So, a raise to 40-60 chips would be reasonable.\n\nThe best action is: `[Raise 40]`\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 2/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips (P0, Small Blind, has put in 20 chips, meaning they raised from 10 to 20, making the total bet 20 chips)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n    *   Your stack: 970 chips\n    *   Your hand: 6\u2666, 3\u2663\n\n2.  **Analysis**:\n    *   You are the Big Blind and posted 20 chips. P0, the Small Blind, has since raised to 20 chips (from their initial 10 chip post). This means you need to call an additional 10 chips to match P0's 20 chip bet (you've already put 10 in for your blind).\n    *   Your hand is 6\u2666, 3\u2663, which is a very weak starting hand, a \"garbage hand\" with low cards and no flush or straight potential.\n    *   P0 has shown strength by raising pre-flop.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   Calling 10 chips to see a flop with such a weak hand is usually a bad move. You are out of position (P0 will act after you on all post-flop streets), and your hand has very little chance of improving to something strong enough to win.\n    *   Raising is out of the question with this hand.\n    *   The most sensible and chip-preserving action is to fold. Folding prevents you from investing more chips into a hand that is highly unlikely to win and saves your stack for better opportunities.\n\n4.  **Action**:\n    *   Given the extremely weak hand and the fact that you're facing a raise, folding is the clear best action.\n\nThe best action is: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2666, 3\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 3/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips (from P0 already putting 10 chips as big blind, and you as small blind put 20 chips)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n    *   Your stack: 950 chips\n    *   Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n\n2.  **Action Required**:\n    As P1 (Small Blind), you have posted 20 chips, while P0 (Big Blind) has posted 10 chips. The action is on you to declare your intention of whether to check, raise, or fold. Wait, this cannot be correct. If (P1) is SB, P1 pays 10, and if P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. Then the total pot should be 30. And you are P1(SB), so you just put in 10 chips to be SB. If the current bet is 20, then P0 must have raised it from 20 to 20 or P0 just called it. Since you are the SB and the pot is 30, and you have put in 20 already, P0 has put 10 chips. So P0 must be the BB, and the actual player on action now is P0.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate current player positions and chips.\n    *   Pot: 30 chips (P1 contributed 20 chips, P0 contributed 10 chips)\n    *   P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020 chips (bet 10.00 | active)\n    *   P1 (SB): 950 chips (bet 20.00 | active)\n    *   This means P1 paid the Big Blind (20 chips) and P0 paid the Small Blind (10 chips). And the action is back to P0.\n\n    This setup contradicts the previous hands where P0 was SB and P1 was BB or vice versa. Let's assume the roles are swapped for this hand.\n\n    Let's assume the problem statement means that Player 0 is the SB and Dealer, and Player 1 is the BB and not the dealer. This would mean that P0 has put in 10 chips, and P1 has put in 20 chips. The current bet would be 20 chips because P1 is in the Big Blind position. Since you are P1, you are the Big Blind, you have already put in 20 chips. The action is now on P0 to call, raise, or fold.\n\n    The problem statement specifies \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\". This implies *you* are Player 1.\n    If you are Player 1 (SB), who bet 20 chips, and Player 0 (Dealer/BB) bet 10 chips. The remaining chips, 10, were already contributed by P0.\n    In a classic setup, SB pays 10, BB pays 20. The current bet is 20 for whoever needs to act.\n\n    Let's assume the standard blind structure:\n    - P1 (SB): 10 chips\n    - P0 (BB/Dealer): 20 chips\n\n    The text \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" suggests P1 *is* the Small Blind, but *already bet 20*. This is highly unusual. If P1 is SB, they typically bet 10. If they have bet 20, it implies they raised to 20, and the previous player (P0) called a 10 chip bet, and now P0 is facing a raise to 20.\n\n    Interpretation 1: Standard blinds, but the status read is confusing.\n    - P0 Dealer/BB, P1 SB.\n    - P1 posted 10 (SB).\n    - P0 posted 20 (BB).\n    - P1 has the first action pre-flop after blinds. Pot is 30.\n    - If P1 bet 20, it means P1 raised (from their 10) to 20. So, P1 has already used 20 chips.\n\n    Interpretation 2: Based directly on the provided info, ignoring standard roles if they conflict.\n    - P0 (Dealer/BB): 10.00 chips contributed.\n    - P1 (SB): 20.00 chips contributed.\n    - Current bet: 20.\n    - Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660 (You are P1)\n\n    This means P1 paid 20 (the BB amount) and P0 paid 10 (the SB amount). So P0 is SB and P1 is BB. And P0 is also the Dealer. This means the blinds are reversed from the previous hand, and P1 is indeed the Big Blind.\n    As Big Blind, you have already posted 20 chips. The \"Current bet: 20\" means there has been no raise. The action is now back to Player 0 who is the Small Blind and the Dealer. Player 0 has put in 10, so they need to put in another 10 to call your 20 chip Big Blind.\n\n    So, as P1 (BB), you have already posted your 20 chips, and the action is currently on Player 0, who needs to decide whether to call (an additional 10 to meet your 20), raise, or fold.\n    The prompt \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies the system is waiting for *my* action. This again conflicts with the standard flow where the BB (P1 in this case) acts last pre-flop if no raises occur.\n\n    Let's assume the game is telling me (Player 1) that it's my turn to act, despite being BB, which would only happen if someone *before* me had placed a bet higher than my 20BB. The only player before me (P1 as BB) would be P0 (SB). If P0 bet 20 and I'm at 20, it implies P0 *called* my 20. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\n    Let's re-read the roles and chips:\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n\n    This indicates `P0` is the `Dealer/BB` and has contributed `10`.\n    This indicates `P1` is the `SB` and has contributed `20`.\n    This is a reversal of standard blinds. If P1 is SB, they should contribute 10. If P0 is BB, they should contribute 20.\n    The most logical interpretation for \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\" with \"Current bet: 20\" is that:\n    1. P1 (SB) put in 10 (or was supposed to).\n    2. P0 (BB) put in 20 (or was supposed to). Pot 30.\n    3. Now P1 (SB) is facing the 20 chip \"bet\" (which is the BB amount) from P0 acting as BB.\n    4. P1 has to decide whether to call 10 more chips to match the 20 (total 20 from P1) or raise.\n\n    So, assuming P1 is the SB (10 chips) and P0 is the BB (20 chips) AND P0 is the Dealer.\n    This means the prompt \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" is misrepresenting \"bet 20.00\". It should be \"bet 10.00\" as the SB amount. If it says \"bet 20.00\", it means P1 already put 20 into the pot. This would usually imply that P1 made a raise or the rules are truly unusual.\n\n    Let's rely on the explicit numerical values provided:\n    - You (P1) have made a bet of 20.\n    - P0 has made a bet of 10.\n    - The current highest bet is 20.\n    - The action is on YOU (P1).\n\n    This scenario only makes sense if the blinds are reversed (P1 is BB, P0 is SB) or if P1 (as SB) has already raised to 20, and P0 (as BB) has called 10 (their SB) and now needs to add another 10 to match P1's 20. But the text says P0 is BB (P0 Dealer/BB...bet 10.00) and P1 is SB (P1 SB...bet 20.00).\n\n    This is a contradictory statement in the `` output.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    If P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. If P1 is SB, P1 pays 10. The sum of blinds is 30. The pot is 30. The \"Current bet: 20\" refers to the highest required contribution. The player whose turn it is needs to match this.\n\n    Given that \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies I am P1, and \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\", it is most likely that as the SB, I have already *raised* to 20. And P0 (BB) has only put in 10. So P0 actually owes 10 to match my bet of 20.\n    But the context implies I am waiting for *my* action.\n\n    Okay, I will assume the provided raw data is exactly what's to be interpreted, even if it contradicts standard game flow.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): ... bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n    \"Current bet: 20\"\n\n    This means P1 (me, SB) has already put in 20 chips, making the current bet 20. P0 (BB/Dealer) has put in 10 chips. The action is currently on player P0, who needs to match the 20 chip bet.\n    *BUT* if the game is waiting for *my* next action, this implies I am the one who has to make a decision. This can only be true if Player 0 has placed a bet or raise *after* my 20-chip contribution, and I am now facing their action. However, the current bet is still 20, which is what I already contributed.\n\n    This means *I am currently facing a bet of 20 (which is the Big Blind amount).*\n    And \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" means I have already put in 20 chips as SB. This is an unusual situation.\n    The only way this makes sense is if the blind amounts are 20 (SB) and 10 (BB), which is rare but possible, or if the \"bet 20.00\" for P1 is the *total* bet for the round (i.e. P1 raised to 20, and now it's P1's turn).\n\n    Let's assume the blinds are 10 (SB) and 20 (BB).\n    P1 is SB, P0 is BB.\n    P1 posts 10. P0 posts 20. Pot 30.\n    Action is on P1 (SB) to call 10 (to match P0's 20), raise, or fold.\n    In this case, the `bet 20.00` for P1 is the *amount they need to call to bring their total contribution to 20*. So, I've put in 10 chips as SB, and now I need to put in 10 more to call P0's BB of 20 chips.\n\n    3. **Analysis**:\n    - Your hand K\u2666, 7\u2660 is a decent speculative hand. It has high card potential with the King and can make a strong pair if a King hits. There's also a backdoor flush or straight opportunity.\n    - You are the Small Blind (SB), and you've already contributed 10 chips. You are facing the Big Blind's 20-chip bet. To call, you need to add 10 more chips.\n    - This is a standard situation for the small blind.\n\n    4. **Decision**:\n    - With K7s, you are usually looking to play, especially if you can get a good price. Calling 10 chips to see a flop with a hand that has reasonable potential (K high, suitedness, Broadway potential) is often a good play.\n    - Raising would be an option to try to win the blinds immediately or build a bigger pot if you think your hand is strong enough to play for value. However, without knowing P0's tendencies, a call is often safer, especially when out of position post-flop.\n    - Folding would be too conservative for K7s, as you've already invested 10 chips and only need to put in 10 more (1 chip for every 3 in the pot plus your bet).\n\n    5. **Action**:\n    - Call the additional 10 chips to meet the 20 current bet.\n    - To call: `[Call]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2666, 3\u2665\n==============================================",

The action is back to you to decide whether to call the additional 10 chips (since 10 of the 20 chips bet by P1 is your initial big blind), fold, or raise.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u26656\u2663, which is not a strong starting hand but has some potential with the Jack being a relatively high card.\n   - You've already invested 10 chips in the pot as the big blind.\n   - The small blind has raised, indicating a potentially stronger hand or an attempt to steal the blinds.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - The current bet is 20, and you've already put in 10. So, to call, you need to put in an additional 10 chips.\n   - Given that you're out of position post-flop (since you're the big blind and the dealer), and facing a raise from the small blind, you need to carefully consider your action.\n   - Your hand isn't particularly strong, but calling an additional 10 chips to see a flop might be a reasonable play to gather more information, especially since the pot odds are favorable (pot size is 30, and you're being asked to pay an additional 10).\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - To call the additional 10 chips: `[Call]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 4\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 1/10\n    *   Round: Flop\n    *   Pot: 40 chips\n    *   Current bet: 0 chips (meaning no action has been taken yet on the flop)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n    *   Your stack: 980 chips\n    *   Your hand: J\u2663, 4\u2666\n    *   Visible board: 9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663\n\n2.  **Analysis**:\n    *   Your hand (J\u2663, 4\u2666) did not connect with the board in any significant way. You have no pair, no flush draw (you have a club, but only one, and there are three clubs on the board), and no straight draw. The highest card on the board is 9\u2663, and you have a Jack, which is currently your high card.\n    *   Player 0 (P0) is the Dealer/Big Blind (BB), meaning they will act after you on subsequent streets.\n    *   The bet is currently 0, meaning you are the first to act on the flop.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   Given that your hand has missed the flop entirely, and you are out of position, betting into P0 would be a bluff. While bluffing can be a part of poker, it's generally risky when you have no equity and are out of position.\n    *   Checking allows you to see P0's action and potentially another card for free if P0 also checks. This is the most conservative and often correct play when you have a weak hand and no immediate connects.\n    *   It's important not to invest more chips into a hand that has a very low probability of improving or winning at showdown.\n\n4.  **Action**:\n    *   Since the current bet is 0, checking is a valid and prudent option.\n\nThe best action is: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Round: Flop\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Player 0 (P0), Dealer, Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your stack: 980 chips\n   - Your hand: 6\u2663, J\u2665\n   - Visible board: 9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663\n\n2. **Action Required**:\n   As P0, you are first to act on the flop. You need to decide whether to check, bet, or potentially fold if you were to face a bet (though that's not a current option).\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand (J\u2665, 6\u2663) has a potential flush draw with clubs, as you have one club and there are three clubs on the board.\n   - The board is relatively draw-heavy with two clubs already on the board, making it potentially dangerous for a hand that doesn't have a club.\n   - You called pre-flop, so your hand isn't extremely strong but has some potential.\n   - P1 checked, indicating they might not have a strong hand or are choosing not to bet.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Given that you have a flush draw (you have one club, and there are three on the board, so you actually have a club draw but it's a bit complicated since the board already has a possible flush), it's worth considering a bet to:\n     - Protect your hand in case P1 has a club or a draw.\n     - Build the pot if you do hit your flush.\n   - However, since the board is quite draw-heavy and you're not sure what P1 has, a more cautious approach could be to check and see how P1 reacts on the turn.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - A reasonable bet could be around half the pot to start, which is 20 chips. This is a balanced play to put pressure on P1 and build the pot.\n   - To bet 20 chips: `[Bet 20]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 4\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Round: Flop\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips (from P0)\n   - Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your stack: 980 chips\n   - Your hand: J\u2663, 4\u2666\n   - Visible board: 9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - P0 has bet 20 chips into a 40-chip pot (which became 60 after their bet). This is a half-pot bet.\n   - Your hand (J\u2663, 4\u2666) still has not connected with the board. You have no pair, no draw, and your high card (Jack) is currently not enough to beat any pair.\n   - P0's bet indicates some strength or a draw.\n   - You previously checked on the flop, signaling weakness or a desire to see a free card.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - You are facing a bet with a very weak hand that has little to no equity.\n   - Calling 20 chips would be investing more into a hand that is highly unlikely to improve or win at showdown.\n   - Raising would be a pure bluff, which is very risky when out of position and with no perceived equity.\n   - Folding is the most prudent action as it minimizes losses in a situation where your hand is clearly behind. It saves your chips for better opportunities.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - Given the lack of any hand value and being out of position, folding is the best option to preserve your stack.\n\nThe best action is: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 60 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, 3\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Round: Pre-flop\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Player 0 (P0), Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your stack: 1000 chips (actually 1040 after winning the previous hand, so it should be 1040)\n   - Your hand: K\u2666, Q\u2660\n\n2. **Action Required**:\n   As P0 (Small Blind), you've already posted 10 chips. P1 (Big Blind) has posted 10 chips as well, and the action is on you to decide whether to call, raise, or fold.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is K\u2666, Q\u2660, a relatively strong starting hand with two high cards.\n   - The pot is 30 chips, and to call, you need to put in an additional 10 chips (since you've already contributed 10 as the small blind).\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - With a hand like K\u2666, Q\u2660, it's generally a good idea to play. You could either call the additional 10 chips or raise to build the pot and narrow the field.\n   - Raising pre-flop with strong cards can be beneficial to maximize the pot and protect your hand.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - To call the additional 10 chips: `[Call]` is a reasonable play, but given your strong hand, raising might be a better option to build the pot and disguise your hand strength.\n   - A standard raise would be to make it 2-3 times the big blind. So, a raise to 40-60 chips would be reasonable.\n\nThe best action is: `[Raise 40]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, 3\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 2/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips (P0, Small Blind, has put in 20 chips, meaning they raised from 10 to 20, making the total bet 20 chips)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n    *   Your stack: 970 chips\n    *   Your hand: 6\u2666, 3\u2663\n\n2.  **Analysis**:\n    *   You are the Big Blind and posted 20 chips. P0, the Small Blind, has since raised to 20 chips (from their initial 10 chip post). This means you need to call an additional 10 chips to match P0's 20 chip bet (you've already put 10 in for your blind).\n    *   Your hand is 6\u2666, 3\u2663, which is a very weak starting hand, a \"garbage hand\" with low cards and no flush or straight potential.\n    *   P0 has shown strength by raising pre-flop.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   Calling 10 chips to see a flop with such a weak hand is usually a bad move. You are out of position (P0 will act after you on all post-flop streets), and your hand has very little chance of improving to something strong enough to win.\n    *   Raising is out of the question with this hand.\n    *   The most sensible and chip-preserving action is to fold. Folding prevents you from investing more chips into a hand that is highly unlikely to win and saves your stack for better opportunities.\n\n4.  **Action**:\n    *   Given the extremely weak hand and the fact that you're facing a raise, folding is the clear best action.\n\nThe best action is: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 3/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips (from P0 already putting 10 chips as big blind, and you as small blind put 20 chips)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n    *   Your stack: 950 chips\n    *   Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n\n2.  **Action Required**:\n    As P1 (Small Blind), you have posted 20 chips, while P0 (Big Blind) has posted 10 chips. The action is on you to declare your intention of whether to check, raise, or fold. Wait, this cannot be correct. If (P1) is SB, P1 pays 10, and if P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. Then the total pot should be 30. And you are P1(SB), so you just put in 10 chips to be SB. If the current bet is 20, then P0 must have raised it from 20 to 20 or P0 just called it. Since you are the SB and the pot is 30, and you have put in 20 already, P0 has put 10 chips. So P0 must be the BB, and the actual player on action now is P0.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate current player positions and chips.\n    *   Pot: 30 chips (P1 contributed 20 chips, P0 contributed 10 chips)\n    *   P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020 chips (bet 10.00 | active)\n    *   P1 (SB): 950 chips (bet 20.00 | active)\n    *   This means P1 paid the Big Blind (20 chips) and P0 paid the Small Blind (10 chips). And the action is back to P0.\n\n    This setup contradicts the previous hands where P0 was SB and P1 was BB or vice versa. Let's assume the roles are swapped for this hand.\n\n    Let's assume the problem statement means that Player 0 is the SB and Dealer, and Player 1 is the BB and not the dealer. This would mean that P0 has put in 10 chips, and P1 has put in 20 chips. The current bet would be 20 chips because P1 is in the Big Blind position. Since you are P1, you are the Big Blind, you have already put in 20 chips. The action is now on P0 to call, raise, or fold.\n\n    The problem statement specifies \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\". This implies *you* are Player 1.\n    If you are Player 1 (SB), who bet 20 chips, and Player 0 (Dealer/BB) bet 10 chips. The remaining chips, 10, were already contributed by P0.\n    In a classic setup, SB pays 10, BB pays 20. The current bet is 20 for whoever needs to act.\n\n    Let's assume the standard blind structure:\n    - P1 (SB): 10 chips\n    - P0 (BB/Dealer): 20 chips\n\n    The text \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" suggests P1 *is* the Small Blind, but *already bet 20*. This is highly unusual. If P1 is SB, they typically bet 10. If they have bet 20, it implies they raised to 20, and the previous player (P0) called a 10 chip bet, and now P0 is facing a raise to 20.\n\n    Interpretation 1: Standard blinds, but the status read is confusing.\n    - P0 Dealer/BB, P1 SB.\n    - P1 posted 10 (SB).\n    - P0 posted 20 (BB).\n    - P1 has the first action pre-flop after blinds. Pot is 30.\n    - If P1 bet 20, it means P1 raised (from their 10) to 20. So, P1 has already used 20 chips.\n\n    Interpretation 2: Based directly on the provided info, ignoring standard roles if they conflict.\n    - P0 (Dealer/BB): 10.00 chips contributed.\n    - P1 (SB): 20.00 chips contributed.\n    - Current bet: 20.\n    - Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660 (You are P1)\n\n    This means P1 paid 20 (the BB amount) and P0 paid 10 (the SB amount). So P0 is SB and P1 is BB. And P0 is also the Dealer. This means the blinds are reversed from the previous hand, and P1 is indeed the Big Blind.\n    As Big Blind, you have already posted 20 chips. The \"Current bet: 20\" means there has been no raise. The action is now back to Player 0 who is the Small Blind and the Dealer. Player 0 has put in 10, so they need to put in another 10 to call your 20 chip Big Blind.\n\n    So, as P1 (BB), you have already posted your 20 chips, and the action is currently on Player 0, who needs to decide whether to call (an additional 10 to meet your 20), raise, or fold.\n    The prompt \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies the system is waiting for *my* action. This again conflicts with the standard flow where the BB (P1 in this case) acts last pre-flop if no raises occur.\n\n    Let's assume the game is telling me (Player 1) that it's my turn to act, despite being BB, which would only happen if someone *before* me had placed a bet higher than my 20BB. The only player before me (P1 as BB) would be P0 (SB). If P0 bet 20 and I'm at 20, it implies P0 *called* my 20. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\n    Let's re-read the roles and chips:\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n\n    This indicates `P0` is the `Dealer/BB` and has contributed `10`.\n    This indicates `P1` is the `SB` and has contributed `20`.\n    This is a reversal of standard blinds. If P1 is SB, they should contribute 10. If P0 is BB, they should contribute 20.\n    The most logical interpretation for \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\" with \"Current bet: 20\" is that:\n    1. P1 (SB) put in 10 (or was supposed to).\n    2. P0 (BB) put in 20 (or was supposed to). Pot 30.\n    3. Now P1 (SB) is facing the 20 chip \"bet\" (which is the BB amount) from P0 acting as BB.\n    4. P1 has to decide whether to call 10 more chips to match the 20 (total 20 from P1) or raise.\n\n    So, assuming P1 is the SB (10 chips) and P0 is the BB (20 chips) AND P0 is the Dealer.\n    This means the prompt \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" is misrepresenting \"bet 20.00\". It should be \"bet 10.00\" as the SB amount. If it says \"bet 20.00\", it means P1 already put 20 into the pot. This would usually imply that P1 made a raise or the rules are truly unusual.\n\n    Let's rely on the explicit numerical values provided:\n    - You (P1) have made a bet of 20.\n    - P0 has made a bet of 10.\n    - The current highest bet is 20.\n    - The action is on YOU (P1).\n\n    This scenario only makes sense if the blinds are reversed (P1 is BB, P0 is SB) or if P1 (as SB) has already raised to 20, and P0 (as BB) has called 10 (their SB) and now needs to add another 10 to match P1's 20. But the text says P0 is BB (P0 Dealer/BB...bet 10.00) and P1 is SB (P1 SB...bet 20.00).\n\n    This is a contradictory statement in the `` output.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    If P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. If P1 is SB, P1 pays 10. The sum of blinds is 30. The pot is 30. The \"Current bet: 20\" refers to the highest required contribution. The player whose turn it is needs to match this.\n\n    Given that \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies I am P1, and \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\", it is most likely that as the SB, I have already *raised* to 20. And P0 (BB) has only put in 10. So P0 actually owes 10 to match my bet of 20.\n    But the context implies I am waiting for *my* action.\n\n    Okay, I will assume the provided raw data is exactly what's to be interpreted, even if it contradicts standard game flow.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): ... bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n    \"Current bet: 20\"\n\n    This means P1 (me, SB) has already put in 20 chips, making the current bet 20. P0 (BB/Dealer) has put in 10 chips. The action is currently on player P0, who needs to match the 20 chip bet.\n    *BUT* if the game is waiting for *my* next action, this implies I am the one who has to make a decision. This can only be true if Player 0 has placed a bet or raise *after* my 20-chip contribution, and I am now facing their action. However, the current bet is still 20, which is what I already contributed.\n\n    This means *I am currently facing a bet of 20 (which is the Big Blind amount).*\n    And \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" means I have already put in 20 chips as SB. This is an unusual situation.\n    The only way this makes sense is if the blind amounts are 20 (SB) and 10 (BB), which is rare but possible, or if the \"bet 20.00\" for P1 is the *total* bet for the round (i.e. P1 raised to 20, and now it's P1's turn).\n\n    Let's assume the blinds are 10 (SB) and 20 (BB).\n    P1 is SB, P0 is BB.\n    P1 posts 10. P0 posts 20. Pot 30.\n    Action is on P1 (SB) to call 10 (to match P0's 20), raise, or fold.\n    In this case, the `bet 20.00` for P1 is the *amount they need to call to bring their total contribution to 20*. So, I've put in 10 chips as SB, and now I need to put in 10 more to call P0's BB of 20 chips.\n\n    3. **Analysis**:\n    - Your hand K\u2666, 7\u2660 is a decent speculative hand. It has high card potential with the King and can make a strong pair if a King hits. There's also a backdoor flush or straight opportunity.\n    - You are the Small Blind (SB), and you've already contributed 10 chips. You are facing the Big Blind's 20-chip bet. To call, you need to add 10 more chips.\n    - This is a standard situation for the small blind.\n\n    4. **Decision**:\n    - With K7s, you are usually looking to play, especially if you can get a good price. Calling 10 chips to see a flop with a hand that has reasonable potential (K high, suitedness, Broadway potential) is often a good play.\n    - Raising would be an option to try to win the blinds immediately or build a bigger pot if you think your hand is strong enough to play for value. However, without knowing P0's tendencies, a call is often safer, especially when out of position post-flop.\n    - Folding would be too conservative for K7s, as you've already invested 10 chips and only need to put in 10 more (1 chip for every 3 in the pot plus your bet).\n\n    5. **Action**:\n    - Call the additional 10 chips to meet the 20 current bet.\n    - To call: `[Call]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Round: Pre-flop\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Player 0 (P0), Dealer, Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your stack: 1020 chips\n   - Your hand: A\u2666, 3\u2665\n   - P1 (SB): 950 chips, bet 20\n\n2. **Action Required**:\n   As P0 (Big Blind/Dealer), you've already posted 10 chips (though it says bet 10, it is likely meant to represent the small blind or an initial contribution). P1 (Small Blind) has raised to 20 chips. You need to decide whether to call the additional 10 chips, raise, or fold.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is A\u2666, 3\u2665.

P0, the Small Blind, has since raised to 20 chips (from their initial 10 chip post). This means you need to call an additional 10 chips to match P0's 20 chip bet (you've already put 10 in for your blind).\n    *   Your hand is 6\u2666, 3\u2663, which is a very weak starting hand, a \"garbage hand\" with low cards and no flush or straight potential.\n    *   P0 has shown strength by raising pre-flop.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   Calling 10 chips to see a flop with such a weak hand is usually a bad move.

Folding prevents you from investing more chips into a hand that is highly unlikely to win and saves your stack for better opportunities.\n\n4.  **Action**:\n    *   Given the extremely weak hand and the fact that you're facing a raise, folding is the clear best action.\n\nThe best action is: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2666, 3\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 3/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips (from P0 already putting 10 chips as big blind, and you as small blind put 20 chips)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n    *   Your stack: 950 chips\n    *   Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n\n2.  **Action Required**:\n    As P1 (Small Blind), you have posted 20 chips, while P0 (Big Blind) has posted 10 chips. The action is on you to declare your intention of whether to check, raise, or fold. Wait, this cannot be correct. If (P1) is SB, P1 pays 10, and if P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. Then the total pot should be 30. And you are P1(SB), so you just put in 10 chips to be SB. If the current bet is 20, then P0 must have raised it from 20 to 20 or P0 just called it. Since you are the SB and the pot is 30, and you have put in 20 already, P0 has put 10 chips. So P0 must be the BB, and the actual player on action now is P0.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate current player positions and chips.\n    *   Pot: 30 chips (P1 contributed 20 chips, P0 contributed 10 chips)\n    *   P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020 chips (bet 10.00 | active)\n    *   P1 (SB): 950 chips (bet 20.00 | active)\n    *   This means P1 paid the Big Blind (20 chips) and P0 paid the Small Blind (10 chips). And the action is back to P0.\n\n    This setup contradicts the previous hands where P0 was SB and P1 was BB or vice versa. Let's assume the roles are swapped for this hand.\n\n    Let's assume the problem statement means that Player 0 is the SB and Dealer, and Player 1 is the BB and not the dealer. This would mean that P0 has put in 10 chips, and P1 has put in 20 chips. The current bet would be 20 chips because P1 is in the Big Blind position. Since you are P1, you are the Big Blind, you have already put in 20 chips. The action is now on P0 to call, raise, or fold.\n\n    The problem statement specifies \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\". This implies *you* are Player 1.\n    If you are Player 1 (SB), who bet 20 chips, and Player 0 (Dealer/BB) bet 10 chips. The remaining chips, 10, were already contributed by P0.\n    In a classic setup, SB pays 10, BB pays 20. The current bet is 20 for whoever needs to act.\n\n    Let's assume the standard blind structure:\n    - P1 (SB): 10 chips\n    - P0 (BB/Dealer): 20 chips\n\n    The text \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" suggests P1 *is* the Small Blind, but *already bet 20*. This is highly unusual. If P1 is SB, they typically bet 10. If they have bet 20, it implies they raised to 20, and the previous player (P0) called a 10 chip bet, and now P0 is facing a raise to 20.\n\n    Interpretation 1: Standard blinds, but the status read is confusing.\n    - P0 Dealer/BB, P1 SB.\n    - P1 posted 10 (SB).\n    - P0 posted 20 (BB).\n    - P1 has the first action pre-flop after blinds. Pot is 30.\n    - If P1 bet 20, it means P1 raised (from their 10) to 20. So, P1 has already used 20 chips.\n\n    Interpretation 2: Based directly on the provided info, ignoring standard roles if they conflict.\n    - P0 (Dealer/BB): 10.00 chips contributed.\n    - P1 (SB): 20.00 chips contributed.\n    - Current bet: 20.\n    - Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660 (You are P1)\n\n    This means P1 paid 20 (the BB amount) and P0 paid 10 (the SB amount). So P0 is SB and P1 is BB. And P0 is also the Dealer. This means the blinds are reversed from the previous hand, and P1 is indeed the Big Blind.\n    As Big Blind, you have already posted 20 chips. The \"Current bet: 20\" means there has been no raise. The action is now back to Player 0 who is the Small Blind and the Dealer. Player 0 has put in 10, so they need to put in another 10 to call your 20 chip Big Blind.\n\n    So, as P1 (BB), you have already posted your 20 chips, and the action is currently on Player 0, who needs to decide whether to call (an additional 10 to meet your 20), raise, or fold.\n    The prompt \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies the system is waiting for *my* action. This again conflicts with the standard flow where the BB (P1 in this case) acts last pre-flop if no raises occur.\n\n    Let's assume the game is telling me (Player 1) that it's my turn to act, despite being BB, which would only happen if someone *before* me had placed a bet higher than my 20BB. The only player before me (P1 as BB) would be P0 (SB). If P0 bet 20 and I'm at 20, it implies P0 *called* my 20. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\n    Let's re-read the roles and chips:\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n\n    This indicates `P0` is the `Dealer/BB` and has contributed `10`.\n    This indicates `P1` is the `SB` and has contributed `20`.\n    This is a reversal of standard blinds. If P1 is SB, they should contribute 10. If P0 is BB, they should contribute 20.\n    The most logical interpretation for \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\" with \"Current bet: 20\" is that:\n    1. P1 (SB) put in 10 (or was supposed to).\n    2. P0 (BB) put in 20 (or was supposed to). Pot 30.\n    3. Now P1 (SB) is facing the 20 chip \"bet\" (which is the BB amount) from P0 acting as BB.\n    4. P1 has to decide whether to call 10 more chips to match the 20 (total 20 from P1) or raise.\n\n    So, assuming P1 is the SB (10 chips) and P0 is the BB (20 chips) AND P0 is the Dealer.\n    This means the prompt \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" is misrepresenting \"bet 20.00\". It should be \"bet 10.00\" as the SB amount. If it says \"bet 20.00\", it means P1 already put 20 into the pot. This would usually imply that P1 made a raise or the rules are truly unusual.\n\n    Let's rely on the explicit numerical values provided:\n    - You (P1) have made a bet of 20.\n    - P0 has made a bet of 10.\n    - The current highest bet is 20.\n    - The action is on YOU (P1).\n\n    This scenario only makes sense if the blinds are reversed (P1 is BB, P0 is SB) or if P1 (as SB) has already raised to 20, and P0 (as BB) has called 10 (their SB) and now needs to add another 10 to match P1's 20. But the text says P0 is BB (P0 Dealer/BB...bet 10.00) and P1 is SB (P1 SB...bet 20.00).\n\n    This is a contradictory statement in the `` output.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    If P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. If P1 is SB, P1 pays 10. The sum of blinds is 30. The pot is 30. The \"Current bet: 20\" refers to the highest required contribution. The player whose turn it is needs to match this.\n\n    Given that \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies I am P1, and \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\", it is most likely that as the SB, I have already *raised* to 20. And P0 (BB) has only put in 10. So P0 actually owes 10 to match my bet of 20.\n    But the context implies I am waiting for *my* action.\n\n    Okay, I will assume the provided raw data is exactly what's to be interpreted, even if it contradicts standard game flow.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): ... bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n    \"Current bet: 20\"\n\n    This means P1 (me, SB) has already put in 20 chips, making the current bet 20. P0 (BB/Dealer) has put in 10 chips. The action is currently on player P0, who needs to match the 20 chip bet.\n    *BUT* if the game is waiting for *my* next action, this implies I am the one who has to make a decision. This can only be true if Player 0 has placed a bet or raise *after* my 20-chip contribution, and I am now facing their action. However, the current bet is still 20, which is what I already contributed.\n\n    This means *I am currently facing a bet of 20 (which is the Big Blind amount).*\n    And \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" means I have already put in 20 chips as SB. This is an unusual situation.\n    The only way this makes sense is if the blind amounts are 20 (SB) and 10 (BB), which is rare but possible, or if the \"bet 20.00\" for P1 is the *total* bet for the round (i.e. P1 raised to 20, and now it's P1's turn).\n\n    Let's assume the blinds are 10 (SB) and 20 (BB).\n    P1 is SB, P0 is BB.\n    P1 posts 10. P0 posts 20. Pot 30.\n    Action is on P1 (SB) to call 10 (to match P0's 20), raise, or fold.\n    In this case, the `bet 20.00` for P1 is the *amount they need to call to bring their total contribution to 20*. So, I've put in 10 chips as SB, and now I need to put in 10 more to call P0's BB of 20 chips.\n\n    3. **Analysis**:\n    - Your hand K\u2666, 7\u2660 is a decent speculative hand. It has high card potential with the King and can make a strong pair if a King hits. There's also a backdoor flush or straight opportunity.\n    - You are the Small Blind (SB), and you've already contributed 10 chips. You are facing the Big Blind's 20-chip bet. To call, you need to add 10 more chips.\n    - This is a standard situation for the small blind.\n\n    4. **Decision**:\n    - With K7s, you are usually looking to play, especially if you can get a good price. Calling 10 chips to see a flop with a hand that has reasonable potential (K high, suitedness, Broadway potential) is often a good play.\n    - Raising would be an option to try to win the blinds immediately or build a bigger pot if you think your hand is strong enough to play for value. However, without knowing P0's tendencies, a call is often safer, especially when out of position post-flop.\n    - Folding would be too conservative for K7s, as you've already invested 10 chips and only need to put in 10 more (1 chip for every 3 in the pot plus your bet).\n\n    5. **Action**:\n    - Call the additional 10 chips to meet the 20 current bet.\n    - To call: `[Call]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2666, 3\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Round: Pre-flop\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Player 0 (P0), Dealer, Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your stack: 1020 chips\n   - Your hand: A\u2666, 3\u2665\n   - P1 (SB): 950 chips, bet 20\n\n2. **Action Required**:\n   As P0 (Big Blind/Dealer), you've already posted 10 chips (though it says bet 10, it is likely meant to represent the small blind or an initial contribution).

You could either call the additional 10 chips or raise to build the pot and narrow the field.\n   - Raising pre-flop with strong cards can be beneficial to maximize the pot and protect your hand.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - To call the additional 10 chips: `[Call]` is a reasonable play, but given your strong hand, raising might be a better option to build the pot and disguise your hand strength.\n   - A standard raise would be to make it 2-3 times the big blind. So, a raise to 40-60 chips would be reasonable.\n\nThe best action is: `[Raise 40]`\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 2/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips (P0, Small Blind, has put in 20 chips, meaning they raised from 10 to 20, making the total bet 20 chips)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n    *   Your stack: 970 chips\n    *   Your hand: 6\u2666, 3\u2663\n\n2.  **Analysis**:\n    *   You are the Big Blind and posted 20 chips. P0, the Small Blind, has since raised to 20 chips (from their initial 10 chip post). This means you need to call an additional 10 chips to match P0's 20 chip bet (you've already put 10 in for your blind).\n    *   Your hand is 6\u2666, 3\u2663, which is a very weak starting hand, a \"garbage hand\" with low cards and no flush or straight potential.\n    *   P0 has shown strength by raising pre-flop.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   Calling 10 chips to see a flop with such a weak hand is usually a bad move. You are out of position (P0 will act after you on all post-flop streets), and your hand has very little chance of improving to something strong enough to win.\n    *   Raising is out of the question with this hand.\n    *   The most sensible and chip-preserving action is to fold. Folding prevents you from investing more chips into a hand that is highly unlikely to win and saves your stack for better opportunities.\n\n4.  **Action**:\n    *   Given the extremely weak hand and the fact that you're facing a raise, folding is the clear best action.\n\nThe best action is: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2666, 3\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 3/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips (from P0 already putting 10 chips as big blind, and you as small blind put 20 chips)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n    *   Your stack: 950 chips\n    *   Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n\n2.  **Action Required**:\n    As P1 (Small Blind), you have posted 20 chips, while P0 (Big Blind) has posted 10 chips. The action is on you to declare your intention of whether to check, raise, or fold. Wait, this cannot be correct. If (P1) is SB, P1 pays 10, and if P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. Then the total pot should be 30. And you are P1(SB), so you just put in 10 chips to be SB. If the current bet is 20, then P0 must have raised it from 20 to 20 or P0 just called it. Since you are the SB and the pot is 30, and you have put in 20 already, P0 has put 10 chips. So P0 must be the BB, and the actual player on action now is P0.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate current player positions and chips.\n    *   Pot: 30 chips (P1 contributed 20 chips, P0 contributed 10 chips)\n    *   P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020 chips (bet 10.00 | active)\n    *   P1 (SB): 950 chips (bet 20.00 | active)\n    *   This means P1 paid the Big Blind (20 chips) and P0 paid the Small Blind (10 chips). And the action is back to P0.\n\n    This setup contradicts the previous hands where P0 was SB and P1 was BB or vice versa. Let's assume the roles are swapped for this hand.\n\n    Let's assume the problem statement means that Player 0 is the SB and Dealer, and Player 1 is the BB and not the dealer. This would mean that P0 has put in 10 chips, and P1 has put in 20 chips. The current bet would be 20 chips because P1 is in the Big Blind position. Since you are P1, you are the Big Blind, you have already put in 20 chips. The action is now on P0 to call, raise, or fold.\n\n    The problem statement specifies \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\". This implies *you* are Player 1.\n    If you are Player 1 (SB), who bet 20 chips, and Player 0 (Dealer/BB) bet 10 chips. The remaining chips, 10, were already contributed by P0.\n    In a classic setup, SB pays 10, BB pays 20. The current bet is 20 for whoever needs to act.\n\n    Let's assume the standard blind structure:\n    - P1 (SB): 10 chips\n    - P0 (BB/Dealer): 20 chips\n\n    The text \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" suggests P1 *is* the Small Blind, but *already bet 20*. This is highly unusual. If P1 is SB, they typically bet 10. If they have bet 20, it implies they raised to 20, and the previous player (P0) called a 10 chip bet, and now P0 is facing a raise to 20.\n\n    Interpretation 1: Standard blinds, but the status read is confusing.\n    - P0 Dealer/BB, P1 SB.\n    - P1 posted 10 (SB).\n    - P0 posted 20 (BB).\n    - P1 has the first action pre-flop after blinds. Pot is 30.\n    - If P1 bet 20, it means P1 raised (from their 10) to 20. So, P1 has already used 20 chips.\n\n    Interpretation 2: Based directly on the provided info, ignoring standard roles if they conflict.\n    - P0 (Dealer/BB): 10.00 chips contributed.\n    - P1 (SB): 20.00 chips contributed.\n    - Current bet: 20.\n    - Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660 (You are P1)\n\n    This means P1 paid 20 (the BB amount) and P0 paid 10 (the SB amount). So P0 is SB and P1 is BB. And P0 is also the Dealer. This means the blinds are reversed from the previous hand, and P1 is indeed the Big Blind.\n    As Big Blind, you have already posted 20 chips. The \"Current bet: 20\" means there has been no raise. The action is now back to Player 0 who is the Small Blind and the Dealer. Player 0 has put in 10, so they need to put in another 10 to call your 20 chip Big Blind.\n\n    So, as P1 (BB), you have already posted your 20 chips, and the action is currently on Player 0, who needs to decide whether to call (an additional 10 to meet your 20), raise, or fold.\n    The prompt \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies the system is waiting for *my* action. This again conflicts with the standard flow where the BB (P1 in this case) acts last pre-flop if no raises occur.\n\n    Let's assume the game is telling me (Player 1) that it's my turn to act, despite being BB, which would only happen if someone *before* me had placed a bet higher than my 20BB. The only player before me (P1 as BB) would be P0 (SB). If P0 bet 20 and I'm at 20, it implies P0 *called* my 20. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\n    Let's re-read the roles and chips:\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n\n    This indicates `P0` is the `Dealer/BB` and has contributed `10`.\n    This indicates `P1` is the `SB` and has contributed `20`.\n    This is a reversal of standard blinds. If P1 is SB, they should contribute 10. If P0 is BB, they should contribute 20.\n    The most logical interpretation for \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\" with \"Current bet: 20\" is that:\n    1. P1 (SB) put in 10 (or was supposed to).\n    2. P0 (BB) put in 20 (or was supposed to). Pot 30.\n    3. Now P1 (SB) is facing the 20 chip \"bet\" (which is the BB amount) from P0 acting as BB.\n    4. P1 has to decide whether to call 10 more chips to match the 20 (total 20 from P1) or raise.\n\n    So, assuming P1 is the SB (10 chips) and P0 is the BB (20 chips) AND P0 is the Dealer.\n    This means the prompt \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" is misrepresenting \"bet 20.00\". It should be \"bet 10.00\" as the SB amount. If it says \"bet 20.00\", it means P1 already put 20 into the pot. This would usually imply that P1 made a raise or the rules are truly unusual.\n\n    Let's rely on the explicit numerical values provided:\n    - You (P1) have made a bet of 20.\n    - P0 has made a bet of 10.\n    - The current highest bet is 20.\n    - The action is on YOU (P1).\n\n    This scenario only makes sense if the blinds are reversed (P1 is BB, P0 is SB) or if P1 (as SB) has already raised to 20, and P0 (as BB) has called 10 (their SB) and now needs to add another 10 to match P1's 20. But the text says P0 is BB (P0 Dealer/BB...bet 10.00) and P1 is SB (P1 SB...bet 20.00).\n\n    This is a contradictory statement in the `` output.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    If P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. If P1 is SB, P1 pays 10. The sum of blinds is 30. The pot is 30. The \"Current bet: 20\" refers to the highest required contribution. The player whose turn it is needs to match this.\n\n    Given that \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies I am P1, and \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\", it is most likely that as the SB, I have already *raised* to 20. And P0 (BB) has only put in 10. So P0 actually owes 10 to match my bet of 20.\n    But the context implies I am waiting for *my* action.\n\n    Okay, I will assume the provided raw data is exactly what's to be interpreted, even if it contradicts standard game flow.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): ... bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n    \"Current bet: 20\"\n\n    This means P1 (me, SB) has already put in 20 chips, making the current bet 20. P0 (BB/Dealer) has put in 10 chips. The action is currently on player P0, who needs to match the 20 chip bet.\n    *BUT* if the game is waiting for *my* next action, this implies I am the one who has to make a decision. This can only be true if Player 0 has placed a bet or raise *after* my 20-chip contribution, and I am now facing their action. However, the current bet is still 20, which is what I already contributed.\n\n    This means *I am currently facing a bet of 20 (which is the Big Blind amount).*\n    And \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" means I have already put in 20 chips as SB. This is an unusual situation.\n    The only way this makes sense is if the blind amounts are 20 (SB) and 10 (BB), which is rare but possible, or if the \"bet 20.00\" for P1 is the *total* bet for the round (i.e. P1 raised to 20, and now it's P1's turn).\n\n    Let's assume the blinds are 10 (SB) and 20 (BB).\n    P1 is SB, P0 is BB.\n    P1 posts 10. P0 posts 20. Pot 30.\n    Action is on P1 (SB) to call 10 (to match P0's 20), raise, or fold.\n    In this case, the `bet 20.00` for P1 is the *amount they need to call to bring their total contribution to 20*. So, I've put in 10 chips as SB, and now I need to put in 10 more to call P0's BB of 20 chips.\n\n    3. **Analysis**:\n    - Your hand K\u2666, 7\u2660 is a decent speculative hand. It has high card potential with the King and can make a strong pair if a King hits. There's also a backdoor flush or straight opportunity.\n    - You are the Small Blind (SB), and you've already contributed 10 chips. You are facing the Big Blind's 20-chip bet. To call, you need to add 10 more chips.\n    - This is a standard situation for the small blind.\n\n    4. **Decision**:\n    - With K7s, you are usually looking to play, especially if you can get a good price. Calling 10 chips to see a flop with a hand that has reasonable potential (K high, suitedness, Broadway potential) is often a good play.\n    - Raising would be an option to try to win the blinds immediately or build a bigger pot if you think your hand is strong enough to play for value. However, without knowing P0's tendencies, a call is often safer, especially when out of position post-flop.\n    - Folding would be too conservative for K7s, as you've already invested 10 chips and only need to put in 10 more (1 chip for every 3 in the pot plus your bet).\n\n    5. **Action**:\n    - Call the additional 10 chips to meet the 20 current bet.\n    - To call: `[Call]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2666, 3\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Round: Pre-flop\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Player 0 (P0), Dealer, Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your stack: 1020 chips\n   - Your hand: A\u2666, 3\u2665\n   - P1 (SB): 950 chips, bet 20\n\n2. **Action Required**:\n   As P0 (Big Blind/Dealer), you've already posted 10 chips (though it says bet 10, it is likely meant to represent the small blind or an initial contribution).

So, a raise to 40-60 chips would be reasonable.\n\nThe best action is: `[Raise 40]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, 3\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 2/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips (P0, Small Blind, has put in 20 chips, meaning they raised from 10 to 20, making the total bet 20 chips)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n    *   Your stack: 970 chips\n    *   Your hand: 6\u2666, 3\u2663\n\n2.  **Analysis**:\n    *   You are the Big Blind and posted 20 chips. P0, the Small Blind, has since raised to 20 chips (from their initial 10 chip post). This means you need to call an additional 10 chips to match P0's 20 chip bet (you've already put 10 in for your blind).\n    *   Your hand is 6\u2666, 3\u2663, which is a very weak starting hand, a \"garbage hand\" with low cards and no flush or straight potential.\n    *   P0 has shown strength by raising pre-flop.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   Calling 10 chips to see a flop with such a weak hand is usually a bad move. You are out of position (P0 will act after you on all post-flop streets), and your hand has very little chance of improving to something strong enough to win.\n    *   Raising is out of the question with this hand.\n    *   The most sensible and chip-preserving action is to fold. Folding prevents you from investing more chips into a hand that is highly unlikely to win and saves your stack for better opportunities.\n\n4.  **Action**:\n    *   Given the extremely weak hand and the fact that you're facing a raise, folding is the clear best action.\n\nThe best action is: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 3/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips (from P0 already putting 10 chips as big blind, and you as small blind put 20 chips)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n    *   Your stack: 950 chips\n    *   Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n\n2.  **Action Required**:\n    As P1 (Small Blind), you have posted 20 chips, while P0 (Big Blind) has posted 10 chips. The action is on you to declare your intention of whether to check, raise, or fold. Wait, this cannot be correct. If (P1) is SB, P1 pays 10, and if P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. Then the total pot should be 30. And you are P1(SB), so you just put in 10 chips to be SB. If the current bet is 20, then P0 must have raised it from 20 to 20 or P0 just called it. Since you are the SB and the pot is 30, and you have put in 20 already, P0 has put 10 chips. So P0 must be the BB, and the actual player on action now is P0.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate current player positions and chips.\n    *   Pot: 30 chips (P1 contributed 20 chips, P0 contributed 10 chips)\n    *   P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020 chips (bet 10.00 | active)\n    *   P1 (SB): 950 chips (bet 20.00 | active)\n    *   This means P1 paid the Big Blind (20 chips) and P0 paid the Small Blind (10 chips). And the action is back to P0.\n\n    This setup contradicts the previous hands where P0 was SB and P1 was BB or vice versa. Let's assume the roles are swapped for this hand.\n\n    Let's assume the problem statement means that Player 0 is the SB and Dealer, and Player 1 is the BB and not the dealer. This would mean that P0 has put in 10 chips, and P1 has put in 20 chips. The current bet would be 20 chips because P1 is in the Big Blind position. Since you are P1, you are the Big Blind, you have already put in 20 chips. The action is now on P0 to call, raise, or fold.\n\n    The problem statement specifies \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\". This implies *you* are Player 1.\n    If you are Player 1 (SB), who bet 20 chips, and Player 0 (Dealer/BB) bet 10 chips. The remaining chips, 10, were already contributed by P0.\n    In a classic setup, SB pays 10, BB pays 20. The current bet is 20 for whoever needs to act.\n\n    Let's assume the standard blind structure:\n    - P1 (SB): 10 chips\n    - P0 (BB/Dealer): 20 chips\n\n    The text \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" suggests P1 *is* the Small Blind, but *already bet 20*. This is highly unusual. If P1 is SB, they typically bet 10. If they have bet 20, it implies they raised to 20, and the previous player (P0) called a 10 chip bet, and now P0 is facing a raise to 20.\n\n    Interpretation 1: Standard blinds, but the status read is confusing.\n    - P0 Dealer/BB, P1 SB.\n    - P1 posted 10 (SB).\n    - P0 posted 20 (BB).\n    - P1 has the first action pre-flop after blinds. Pot is 30.\n    - If P1 bet 20, it means P1 raised (from their 10) to 20. So, P1 has already used 20 chips.\n\n    Interpretation 2: Based directly on the provided info, ignoring standard roles if they conflict.\n    - P0 (Dealer/BB): 10.00 chips contributed.\n    - P1 (SB): 20.00 chips contributed.\n    - Current bet: 20.\n    - Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660 (You are P1)\n\n    This means P1 paid 20 (the BB amount) and P0 paid 10 (the SB amount). So P0 is SB and P1 is BB. And P0 is also the Dealer. This means the blinds are reversed from the previous hand, and P1 is indeed the Big Blind.\n    As Big Blind, you have already posted 20 chips. The \"Current bet: 20\" means there has been no raise. The action is now back to Player 0 who is the Small Blind and the Dealer. Player 0 has put in 10, so they need to put in another 10 to call your 20 chip Big Blind.\n\n    So, as P1 (BB), you have already posted your 20 chips, and the action is currently on Player 0, who needs to decide whether to call (an additional 10 to meet your 20), raise, or fold.\n    The prompt \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies the system is waiting for *my* action. This again conflicts with the standard flow where the BB (P1 in this case) acts last pre-flop if no raises occur.\n\n    Let's assume the game is telling me (Player 1) that it's my turn to act, despite being BB, which would only happen if someone *before* me had placed a bet higher than my 20BB. The only player before me (P1 as BB) would be P0 (SB). If P0 bet 20 and I'm at 20, it implies P0 *called* my 20. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\n    Let's re-read the roles and chips:\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n\n    This indicates `P0` is the `Dealer/BB` and has contributed `10`.\n    This indicates `P1` is the `SB` and has contributed `20`.\n    This is a reversal of standard blinds. If P1 is SB, they should contribute 10. If P0 is BB, they should contribute 20.\n    The most logical interpretation for \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\" with \"Current bet: 20\" is that:\n    1. P1 (SB) put in 10 (or was supposed to).\n    2. P0 (BB) put in 20 (or was supposed to). Pot 30.\n    3. Now P1 (SB) is facing the 20 chip \"bet\" (which is the BB amount) from P0 acting as BB.\n    4. P1 has to decide whether to call 10 more chips to match the 20 (total 20 from P1) or raise.\n\n    So, assuming P1 is the SB (10 chips) and P0 is the BB (20 chips) AND P0 is the Dealer.\n    This means the prompt \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" is misrepresenting \"bet 20.00\". It should be \"bet 10.00\" as the SB amount. If it says \"bet 20.00\", it means P1 already put 20 into the pot. This would usually imply that P1 made a raise or the rules are truly unusual.\n\n    Let's rely on the explicit numerical values provided:\n    - You (P1) have made a bet of 20.\n    - P0 has made a bet of 10.\n    - The current highest bet is 20.\n    - The action is on YOU (P1).\n\n    This scenario only makes sense if the blinds are reversed (P1 is BB, P0 is SB) or if P1 (as SB) has already raised to 20, and P0 (as BB) has called 10 (their SB) and now needs to add another 10 to match P1's 20. But the text says P0 is BB (P0 Dealer/BB...bet 10.00) and P1 is SB (P1 SB...bet 20.00).\n\n    This is a contradictory statement in the `` output.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    If P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. If P1 is SB, P1 pays 10. The sum of blinds is 30. The pot is 30. The \"Current bet: 20\" refers to the highest required contribution. The player whose turn it is needs to match this.\n\n    Given that \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies I am P1, and \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\", it is most likely that as the SB, I have already *raised* to 20. And P0 (BB) has only put in 10. So P0 actually owes 10 to match my bet of 20.\n    But the context implies I am waiting for *my* action.\n\n    Okay, I will assume the provided raw data is exactly what's to be interpreted, even if it contradicts standard game flow.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): ... bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n    \"Current bet: 20\"\n\n    This means P1 (me, SB) has already put in 20 chips, making the current bet 20. P0 (BB/Dealer) has put in 10 chips. The action is currently on player P0, who needs to match the 20 chip bet.\n    *BUT* if the game is waiting for *my* next action, this implies I am the one who has to make a decision. This can only be true if Player 0 has placed a bet or raise *after* my 20-chip contribution, and I am now facing their action. However, the current bet is still 20, which is what I already contributed.\n\n    This means *I am currently facing a bet of 20 (which is the Big Blind amount).*\n    And \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" means I have already put in 20 chips as SB. This is an unusual situation.\n    The only way this makes sense is if the blind amounts are 20 (SB) and 10 (BB), which is rare but possible, or if the \"bet 20.00\" for P1 is the *total* bet for the round (i.e. P1 raised to 20, and now it's P1's turn).\n\n    Let's assume the blinds are 10 (SB) and 20 (BB).\n    P1 is SB, P0 is BB.\n    P1 posts 10. P0 posts 20. Pot 30.\n    Action is on P1 (SB) to call 10 (to match P0's 20), raise, or fold.\n    In this case, the `bet 20.00` for P1 is the *amount they need to call to bring their total contribution to 20*. So, I've put in 10 chips as SB, and now I need to put in 10 more to call P0's BB of 20 chips.\n\n    3. **Analysis**:\n    - Your hand K\u2666, 7\u2660 is a decent speculative hand. It has high card potential with the King and can make a strong pair if a King hits. There's also a backdoor flush or straight opportunity.\n    - You are the Small Blind (SB), and you've already contributed 10 chips. You are facing the Big Blind's 20-chip bet. To call, you need to add 10 more chips.\n    - This is a standard situation for the small blind.\n\n    4. **Decision**:\n    - With K7s, you are usually looking to play, especially if you can get a good price. Calling 10 chips to see a flop with a hand that has reasonable potential (K high, suitedness, Broadway potential) is often a good play.\n    - Raising would be an option to try to win the blinds immediately or build a bigger pot if you think your hand is strong enough to play for value. However, without knowing P0's tendencies, a call is often safer, especially when out of position post-flop.\n    - Folding would be too conservative for K7s, as you've already invested 10 chips and only need to put in 10 more (1 chip for every 3 in the pot plus your bet).\n\n    5. **Action**:\n    - Call the additional 10 chips to meet the 20 current bet.\n    - To call: `[Call]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Round: Pre-flop\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Player 0 (P0), Dealer, Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your stack: 1020 chips\n   - Your hand: A\u2666, 3\u2665\n   - P1 (SB): 950 chips, bet 20\n\n2. **Action Required**:\n   As P0 (Big Blind/Dealer), you've already posted 10 chips (though it says bet 10, it is likely meant to represent the small blind or an initial contribution). P1 (Small Blind) has raised to 20 chips. You need to decide whether to call the additional 10 chips, raise, or fold.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is A\u2666, 3\u2665. The Ace is a good high card, but the hand is not particularly strong due to the low kicker.\n   - P1 has raised from the Small Blind, indicating potential strength or an attempt to steal.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Calling the additional 10 chips is a reasonable play to see a flop, especially since you have an Ace.

You've already posted 10 chips as the big blind. The action is back to you to decide whether to call the additional 10 chips (since 10 of the 20 chips bet by P1 is your initial big blind), fold, or raise.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u26656\u2663, which is not a strong starting hand but has some potential with the Jack being a relatively high card.\n   - You've already invested 10 chips in the pot as the big blind.\n   - The small blind has raised, indicating a potentially stronger hand or an attempt to steal the blinds.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - The current bet is 20, and you've already put in 10. So, to call, you need to put in an additional 10 chips.\n   - Given that you're out of position post-flop (since you're the big blind and the dealer), and facing a raise from the small blind, you need to carefully consider your action.\n   - Your hand isn't particularly strong, but calling an additional 10 chips to see a flop might be a reasonable play to gather more information, especially since the pot odds are favorable (pot size is 30, and you're being asked to pay an additional 10).\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - To call the additional 10 chips: `[Call]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 4\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 1/10\n    *   Round: Flop\n    *   Pot: 40 chips\n    *   Current bet: 0 chips (meaning no action has been taken yet on the flop)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n    *   Your stack: 980 chips\n    *   Your hand: J\u2663, 4\u2666\n    *   Visible board: 9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663\n\n2.  **Analysis**:\n    *   Your hand (J\u2663, 4\u2666) did not connect with the board in any significant way. You have no pair, no flush draw (you have a club, but only one, and there are three clubs on the board), and no straight draw. The highest card on the board is 9\u2663, and you have a Jack, which is currently your high card.\n    *   Player 0 (P0) is the Dealer/Big Blind (BB), meaning they will act after you on subsequent streets.\n    *   The bet is currently 0, meaning you are the first to act on the flop.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   Given that your hand has missed the flop entirely, and you are out of position, betting into P0 would be a bluff. While bluffing can be a part of poker, it's generally risky when you have no equity and are out of position.\n    *   Checking allows you to see P0's action and potentially another card for free if P0 also checks. This is the most conservative and often correct play when you have a weak hand and no immediate connects.\n    *   It's important not to invest more chips into a hand that has a very low probability of improving or winning at showdown.\n\n4.  **Action**:\n    *   Since the current bet is 0, checking is a valid and prudent option.\n\nThe best action is: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Round: Flop\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Player 0 (P0), Dealer, Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your stack: 980 chips\n   - Your hand: 6\u2663, J\u2665\n   - Visible board: 9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663\n\n2. **Action Required**:\n   As P0, you are first to act on the flop. You need to decide whether to check, bet, or potentially fold if you were to face a bet (though that's not a current option).\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand (J\u2665, 6\u2663) has a potential flush draw with clubs, as you have one club and there are three clubs on the board.\n   - The board is relatively draw-heavy with two clubs already on the board, making it potentially dangerous for a hand that doesn't have a club.\n   - You called pre-flop, so your hand isn't extremely strong but has some potential.\n   - P1 checked, indicating they might not have a strong hand or are choosing not to bet.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Given that you have a flush draw (you have one club, and there are three on the board, so you actually have a club draw but it's a bit complicated since the board already has a possible flush), it's worth considering a bet to:\n     - Protect your hand in case P1 has a club or a draw.\n     - Build the pot if you do hit your flush.\n   - However, since the board is quite draw-heavy and you're not sure what P1 has, a more cautious approach could be to check and see how P1 reacts on the turn.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - A reasonable bet could be around half the pot to start, which is 20 chips. This is a balanced play to put pressure on P1 and build the pot.\n   - To bet 20 chips: `[Bet 20]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 4\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Round: Flop\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips (from P0)\n   - Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your stack: 980 chips\n   - Your hand: J\u2663, 4\u2666\n   - Visible board: 9\u2663, 3\u2666, 5\u2663\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - P0 has bet 20 chips into a 40-chip pot (which became 60 after their bet). This is a half-pot bet.\n   - Your hand (J\u2663, 4\u2666) still has not connected with the board. You have no pair, no draw, and your high card (Jack) is currently not enough to beat any pair.\n   - P0's bet indicates some strength or a draw.\n   - You previously checked on the flop, signaling weakness or a desire to see a free card.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - You are facing a bet with a very weak hand that has little to no equity.\n   - Calling 20 chips would be investing more into a hand that is highly unlikely to improve or win at showdown.\n   - Raising would be a pure bluff, which is very risky when out of position and with no perceived equity.\n   - Folding is the most prudent action as it minimizes losses in a situation where your hand is clearly behind. It saves your chips for better opportunities.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - Given the lack of any hand value and being out of position, folding is the best option to preserve your stack.\n\nThe best action is: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 60 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, 3\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Round: Pre-flop\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Player 0 (P0), Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your stack: 1000 chips (actually 1040 after winning the previous hand, so it should be 1040)\n   - Your hand: K\u2666, Q\u2660\n\n2. **Action Required**:\n   As P0 (Small Blind), you've already posted 10 chips. P1 (Big Blind) has posted 10 chips as well, and the action is on you to decide whether to call, raise, or fold.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is K\u2666, Q\u2660, a relatively strong starting hand with two high cards.\n   - The pot is 30 chips, and to call, you need to put in an additional 10 chips (since you've already contributed 10 as the small blind).\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - With a hand like K\u2666, Q\u2660, it's generally a good idea to play. You could either call the additional 10 chips or raise to build the pot and narrow the field.\n   - Raising pre-flop with strong cards can be beneficial to maximize the pot and protect your hand.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - To call the additional 10 chips: `[Call]` is a reasonable play, but given your strong hand, raising might be a better option to build the pot and disguise your hand strength.\n   - A standard raise would be to make it 2-3 times the big blind. So, a raise to 40-60 chips would be reasonable.\n\nThe best action is: `[Raise 40]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, 3\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 2/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips (P0, Small Blind, has put in 20 chips, meaning they raised from 10 to 20, making the total bet 20 chips)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n    *   Your stack: 970 chips\n    *   Your hand: 6\u2666, 3\u2663\n\n2.  **Analysis**:\n    *   You are the Big Blind and posted 20 chips. P0, the Small Blind, has since raised to 20 chips (from their initial 10 chip post). This means you need to call an additional 10 chips to match P0's 20 chip bet (you've already put 10 in for your blind).\n    *   Your hand is 6\u2666, 3\u2663, which is a very weak starting hand, a \"garbage hand\" with low cards and no flush or straight potential.\n    *   P0 has shown strength by raising pre-flop.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   Calling 10 chips to see a flop with such a weak hand is usually a bad move. You are out of position (P0 will act after you on all post-flop streets), and your hand has very little chance of improving to something strong enough to win.\n    *   Raising is out of the question with this hand.\n    *   The most sensible and chip-preserving action is to fold. Folding prevents you from investing more chips into a hand that is highly unlikely to win and saves your stack for better opportunities.\n\n4.  **Action**:\n    *   Given the extremely weak hand and the fact that you're facing a raise, folding is the clear best action.\n\nThe best action is: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 3/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips (from P0 already putting 10 chips as big blind, and you as small blind put 20 chips)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n    *   Your stack: 950 chips\n    *   Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n\n2.  **Action Required**:\n    As P1 (Small Blind), you have posted 20 chips, while P0 (Big Blind) has posted 10 chips. The action is on you to declare your intention of whether to check, raise, or fold. Wait, this cannot be correct. If (P1) is SB, P1 pays 10, and if P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. Then the total pot should be 30. And you are P1(SB), so you just put in 10 chips to be SB. If the current bet is 20, then P0 must have raised it from 20 to 20 or P0 just called it. Since you are the SB and the pot is 30, and you have put in 20 already, P0 has put 10 chips. So P0 must be the BB, and the actual player on action now is P0.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate current player positions and chips.\n    *   Pot: 30 chips (P1 contributed 20 chips, P0 contributed 10 chips)\n    *   P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020 chips (bet 10.00 | active)\n    *   P1 (SB): 950 chips (bet 20.00 | active)\n    *   This means P1 paid the Big Blind (20 chips) and P0 paid the Small Blind (10 chips). And the action is back to P0.\n\n    This setup contradicts the previous hands where P0 was SB and P1 was BB or vice versa. Let's assume the roles are swapped for this hand.\n\n    Let's assume the problem statement means that Player 0 is the SB and Dealer, and Player 1 is the BB and not the dealer. This would mean that P0 has put in 10 chips, and P1 has put in 20 chips. The current bet would be 20 chips because P1 is in the Big Blind position. Since you are P1, you are the Big Blind, you have already put in 20 chips. The action is now on P0 to call, raise, or fold.\n\n    The problem statement specifies \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\". This implies *you* are Player 1.\n    If you are Player 1 (SB), who bet 20 chips, and Player 0 (Dealer/BB) bet 10 chips. The remaining chips, 10, were already contributed by P0.\n    In a classic setup, SB pays 10, BB pays 20. The current bet is 20 for whoever needs to act.\n\n    Let's assume the standard blind structure:\n    - P1 (SB): 10 chips\n    - P0 (BB/Dealer): 20 chips\n\n    The text \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" suggests P1 *is* the Small Blind, but *already bet 20*. This is highly unusual. If P1 is SB, they typically bet 10. If they have bet 20, it implies they raised to 20, and the previous player (P0) called a 10 chip bet, and now P0 is facing a raise to 20.\n\n    Interpretation 1: Standard blinds, but the status read is confusing.\n    - P0 Dealer/BB, P1 SB.\n    - P1 posted 10 (SB).\n    - P0 posted 20 (BB).\n    - P1 has the first action pre-flop after blinds. Pot is 30.\n    - If P1 bet 20, it means P1 raised (from their 10) to 20. So, P1 has already used 20 chips.\n\n    Interpretation 2: Based directly on the provided info, ignoring standard roles if they conflict.\n    - P0 (Dealer/BB): 10.00 chips contributed.\n    - P1 (SB): 20.00 chips contributed.\n    - Current bet: 20.\n    - Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660 (You are P1)\n\n    This means P1 paid 20 (the BB amount) and P0 paid 10 (the SB amount). So P0 is SB and P1 is BB. And P0 is also the Dealer. This means the blinds are reversed from the previous hand, and P1 is indeed the Big Blind.\n    As Big Blind, you have already posted 20 chips. The \"Current bet: 20\" means there has been no raise. The action is now back to Player 0 who is the Small Blind and the Dealer. Player 0 has put in 10, so they need to put in another 10 to call your 20 chip Big Blind.\n\n    So, as P1 (BB), you have already posted your 20 chips, and the action is currently on Player 0, who needs to decide whether to call (an additional 10 to meet your 20), raise, or fold.\n    The prompt \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies the system is waiting for *my* action. This again conflicts with the standard flow where the BB (P1 in this case) acts last pre-flop if no raises occur.\n\n    Let's assume the game is telling me (Player 1) that it's my turn to act, despite being BB, which would only happen if someone *before* me had placed a bet higher than my 20BB. The only player before me (P1 as BB) would be P0 (SB). If P0 bet 20 and I'm at 20, it implies P0 *called* my 20. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\n    Let's re-read the roles and chips:\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n\n    This indicates `P0` is the `Dealer/BB` and has contributed `10`.\n    This indicates `P1` is the `SB` and has contributed `20`.\n    This is a reversal of standard blinds. If P1 is SB, they should contribute 10. If P0 is BB, they should contribute 20.\n    The most logical interpretation for \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\" with \"Current bet: 20\" is that:\n    1. P1 (SB) put in 10 (or was supposed to).\n    2. P0 (BB) put in 20 (or was supposed to). Pot 30.\n    3. Now P1 (SB) is facing the 20 chip \"bet\" (which is the BB amount) from P0 acting as BB.\n    4. P1 has to decide whether to call 10 more chips to match the 20 (total 20 from P1) or raise.\n\n    So, assuming P1 is the SB (10 chips) and P0 is the BB (20 chips) AND P0 is the Dealer.\n    This means the prompt \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" is misrepresenting \"bet 20.00\". It should be \"bet 10.00\" as the SB amount. If it says \"bet 20.00\", it means P1 already put 20 into the pot. This would usually imply that P1 made a raise or the rules are truly unusual.\n\n    Let's rely on the explicit numerical values provided:\n    - You (P1) have made a bet of 20.\n    - P0 has made a bet of 10.\n    - The current highest bet is 20.\n    - The action is on YOU (P1).\n\n    This scenario only makes sense if the blinds are reversed (P1 is BB, P0 is SB) or if P1 (as SB) has already raised to 20, and P0 (as BB) has called 10 (their SB) and now needs to add another 10 to match P1's 20. But the text says P0 is BB (P0 Dealer/BB...bet 10.00) and P1 is SB (P1 SB...bet 20.00).\n\n    This is a contradictory statement in the `` output.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    If P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. If P1 is SB, P1 pays 10. The sum of blinds is 30. The pot is 30. The \"Current bet: 20\" refers to the highest required contribution. The player whose turn it is needs to match this.\n\n    Given that \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies I am P1, and \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\", it is most likely that as the SB, I have already *raised* to 20. And P0 (BB) has only put in 10. So P0 actually owes 10 to match my bet of 20.\n    But the context implies I am waiting for *my* action.\n\n    Okay, I will assume the provided raw data is exactly what's to be interpreted, even if it contradicts standard game flow.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): ... bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n    \"Current bet: 20\"\n\n    This means P1 (me, SB) has already put in 20 chips, making the current bet 20. P0 (BB/Dealer) has put in 10 chips. The action is currently on player P0, who needs to match the 20 chip bet.\n    *BUT* if the game is waiting for *my* next action, this implies I am the one who has to make a decision. This can only be true if Player 0 has placed a bet or raise *after* my 20-chip contribution, and I am now facing their action. However, the current bet is still 20, which is what I already contributed.\n\n    This means *I am currently facing a bet of 20 (which is the Big Blind amount).*\n    And \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" means I have already put in 20 chips as SB. This is an unusual situation.\n    The only way this makes sense is if the blind amounts are 20 (SB) and 10 (BB), which is rare but possible, or if the \"bet 20.00\" for P1 is the *total* bet for the round (i.e. P1 raised to 20, and now it's P1's turn).\n\n    Let's assume the blinds are 10 (SB) and 20 (BB).\n    P1 is SB, P0 is BB.\n    P1 posts 10. P0 posts 20. Pot 30.\n    Action is on P1 (SB) to call 10 (to match P0's 20), raise, or fold.\n    In this case, the `bet 20.00` for P1 is the *amount they need to call to bring their total contribution to 20*. So, I've put in 10 chips as SB, and now I need to put in 10 more to call P0's BB of 20 chips.\n\n    3. **Analysis**:\n    - Your hand K\u2666, 7\u2660 is a decent speculative hand. It has high card potential with the King and can make a strong pair if a King hits. There's also a backdoor flush or straight opportunity.\n    - You are the Small Blind (SB), and you've already contributed 10 chips. You are facing the Big Blind's 20-chip bet. To call, you need to add 10 more chips.\n    - This is a standard situation for the small blind.\n\n    4. **Decision**:\n    - With K7s, you are usually looking to play, especially if you can get a good price. Calling 10 chips to see a flop with a hand that has reasonable potential (K high, suitedness, Broadway potential) is often a good play.\n    - Raising would be an option to try to win the blinds immediately or build a bigger pot if you think your hand is strong enough to play for value. However, without knowing P0's tendencies, a call is often safer, especially when out of position post-flop.\n    - Folding would be too conservative for K7s, as you've already invested 10 chips and only need to put in 10 more (1 chip for every 3 in the pot plus your bet).\n\n    5. **Action**:\n    - Call the additional 10 chips to meet the 20 current bet.\n    - To call: `[Call]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Round: Pre-flop\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Player 0 (P0), Dealer, Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your stack: 1020 chips\n   - Your hand: A\u2666, 3\u2665\n   - P1 (SB): 950 chips, bet 20\n\n2. **Action Required**:\n   As P0 (Big Blind/Dealer), you've already posted 10 chips (though it says bet 10, it is likely meant to represent the small blind or an initial contribution).

This is a small pair, but it currently beats a high card.\n    *   You have a king kicker, which is good.\n    *   The board is relatively low and wet (two clubs, indicating a potential flush draw for some hands).\n    *   You are the Small Blind, meaning you will act first on every post-flop street.\n    *   P0 has checked.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   You have hit a pair, which gives you some hand strength.\n    *   **Betting** allows you to extract value from P0 if they have a draw or a weaker pair, or to protect your hand if someone is on a flush draw. A half-pot bet (20 chips) is a standard size.\n    *   **Checking** might encourage P0 to bet if they have something, allowing you to check-raise, but it also gives P0 a free card if they have a draw, which could be dangerous.\n    *   Given you made a pair, betting for value and protection is generally a good approach when you are out of position.\n\n4.  **Action**:\n    *   Betting to build the pot and get value from your pair of sevens.

You have an Ace, but it's not clear if it's the best hand.\n - P1 bet20 chips into a60-chip pot, which is a third-pot bet. This could indicate a range of hands, from draws to made hands.\n - The board is7\u2663,5\u2665,2\u2663, with two clubs, indicating a potential flush draw. P1's bet could be a flush draw, a made hand like a pair, or a semi-bluff.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n - **Calling** would be a reasonable play if you think your Ace might be good or if you're getting a good price to call with a potential draw. However, you don't have a flush draw.\n - **Raising** would be a strong play if you have a strong hand or want to bluff. Given your hand isn't strong, a bluff raise is an option but it's risky against P1's range.\n - **Folding** is a safe option if you believe P1 has a strong hand.

This means P0 originally put in 10 chips as SB, and then put in another 10 chips to call your 20 blinds.\n    *   Your hand is J\u2660, 3\u2663, which is a very weak hand. It has a high card of Jack, but no suitedness, and the 3 is a very low kicker. This hand rarely makes strong pairs or draws.\n    *   Since all players have called the big blind, there have been no raises. You are the last to act pre-flop.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   You are in the Big Blind and hold a very weak hand.\n    *   Since no one has raised, you have the option to \"check,\" which means you don't have to put in any more chips to see the flop. This is known as a \"free play\" from the Big Blind.\n    *   Raising with this weak hand would be a pure bluff, which is generally not advisable, especially when out of position post-flop.\n    *   Folding is not necessary as you have the option to check.\n\n4.  **Action**:\n    *   Since you are the Big Blind and the action is on you, and a bet of 20 chips has already been met by P0, you can check to see the flop without investing any more chips.\n\nThe best action is: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 attempted an invalid move. Reason: Cannot check facing a bet. Please resubmit a valid move and remember to follow the game rules to avoid penalties.",
      "response": "[Player 1]   I apologize for the invalid move. My analysis was flawed regarding the current bet status.\n\nLet me re-evaluate the state and the rules carefully.\n\n1.  **Current State (Re-evaluation)**:\n    *   Hand: 4/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n    *   Your stack: 980 chips\n    *   Your hand: J\u2660, 3\u2663\n\n2.  **Clarification of the previous state and my error**:\n    My previous understanding was that P0 \"called\" the 20 BB. However, the game output \"P0 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" implies that Player 0, who is the Small Blind, has put in 20 chips. This means P0 *raised* to 20 chips (from their initial 10 SB contribution), making the current bet 20 chips that both players need to match.\n\n    *   Initial blinds: P0 (SB) posts 10, P1 (BB) posts 20. Pot = 30.\n    *   Action is on P0.\n    *   P0 has just raised to 20. This means P0 added 10 more chips to their initial 10.\n    *   Now, you (P1), as the Big Blind, have already contributed 20 chips. So, P0's raise to 20 is exactly what you have in the pot. The \"Current bet: 20\" means that the highest bet is 20, and because you've already matched this 20, you have the option to check, raise, or fold.\n\n    **My previous error was based on the system's previous correction where I was unable to check facing a bet.**\n    The rule states: \"Check when facing a bet is invalid.\"\n    If the current bet is 20, and I (P1) have *already* contributed 20, then I am not \"facing a bet\" in the sense of needing to add more chips. Player 0 has made their contribution to a *total* of 20. Since I have also contributed 20 (my Big Blind), the action is effectively *checked around* to me.\n\n    This means the previous \"Player 0 calls 10\" was referring to P0 calling the *initial* 20 BB, not raising. Let me pull the actual game log:\n    `[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====`\n    `Pot: 30 | Current bet: 20`\n    `Visible board: []`\n    `P0 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active`\n    `P1 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active`\n    `Your hole: J\u2660, 3\u2663`\n    And what I tried to do was `[Check]`.\n\n    The line `P0 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active` indicates that P0 has *already* bet 20 chips. So, P0 did not \"call 10\", they either paid their 10 SB and then *raised* to 20, or they started with 0 and bet 20.\n    The preceding text was:\n    `[Player 0] ...The best action is: [Call]` that implies P0 called the 20 (BB).\n    If P0 called the 20, then P0's `bet` column would reflect 20.\n    The issue is: `Current bet: 20`. This means the highest amount anyone has contributed *this betting round* is 20.\n    You (P1, BB) have contributed 10 (as indicated by `bet 10.00`, which is the BB amount in this setup if P0 is SB and P1 is BB, then BB is 20).\n\n    Let's re-confirm the blind structure implied by previous hands and the current state.\n    Hand 1: P0 (BB) 10, P1 (SB) 20. This contradicts my current understanding.\n    Hand 2: P0 (SB) 20, P1 (BB) 10. This is the normal reversal.\n    Hand 3: P0 (BB) 10, P1 (SB) 20. This is the odd one, matches Hand 1 setup.\n    Hand 4: P0 (SB) 20, P1 (BB/Dealer) 10. This means blinds are reversed from standard logic, and the \"bet\" amounts shown are inconsistent with blinds.\n\n    Let's just follow the provided **numerical state variables strictly**:\n    - You are Player 1.\n    - `Pot: 30` (This means 30 chips are already in the pot from blinds/previous action)\n    - `Current bet: 20` (The amount that needs to be matched by anyone making an action to continue)\n    - `P0 (SB): ... bet 20.00` (P0 has put in 20 chips)\n    - `P1 (Dealer/BB): ... bet 10.00` (You have put in 10 chips)\n    - `Your hole: J\u2660, 3\u2663`\n\n    This means P0 (Small Blind) made a bet of 20 chips.\n    You (P1, Big Blind/Dealer) have only put in 10 chips so far.\n    To continue in the hand, you need to match the 'Current bet: 20'.\n    Since you have only put in 10, you need to add an *additional 10 chips* to call P0's bet.\n\n    My previous analysis of \"effectively checked around\" was fundamentally incorrect because my 'bet' amount was 10, not 20. I *am* indeed \"facing a bet\" of 20, and I have only contributed 10.\n\n3.  **Analysis (Corrected)**:\n    *   You (P1) are the Big Blind. You have contributed 10 chips (potentially the Small Blind was 10 and you were BB 20, but the `bet 10.00` is the amount currently attributed to you).\n    *   P0, who is listed as SB, has contributed 20 chips. This means P0 has either posted 20 as their blind or they raised to 20 from a 10 blind.\n    *   In any case, the `Current bet` for anyone to continue is 20.\n    *   You have already contributed 10 chips. So, you need to put in an *additional 10 chips* to call P0's bet of 20.\n    *   Your hand is J\u2660, 3\u2663, which is a very weak hand. It has very little potential.\n\n4.  **Decision (Corrected)**:\n    *   You are facing a bet of 20 chips, and you only have 10 chips invested. You need to put in 10 more chips to call.\n    *   Given your very weak hand (J\u2660, 3\u2663), calling 10 more chips would be a poor decision. Your hand has very little equity to win the pot.\n    *   Raising would be an even worse decision, as it would commit more chips to a very low-probability hand.\n    *   The best action is to fold, thereby minimizing your losses and saving your chips for better hands.\n\n5.  **Action (Corrected)**:\n    *   Fold to P0's bet.\n\nThe best action is: `[Fold]`",

P0, the Small Blind, has since raised to 20 chips (from their initial 10 chip post). This means you need to call an additional 10 chips to match P0's 20 chip bet (you've already put 10 in for your blind).\n    *   Your hand is 6\u2666, 3\u2663, which is a very weak starting hand, a \"garbage hand\" with low cards and no flush or straight potential.\n    *   P0 has shown strength by raising pre-flop.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   Calling 10 chips to see a flop with such a weak hand is usually a bad move. You are out of position (P0 will act after you on all post-flop streets), and your hand has very little chance of improving to something strong enough to win.\n    *   Raising is out of the question with this hand.\n    *   The most sensible and chip-preserving action is to fold. Folding prevents you from investing more chips into a hand that is highly unlikely to win and saves your stack for better opportunities.\n\n4.  **Action**:\n    *   Given the extremely weak hand and the fact that you're facing a raise, folding is the clear best action.\n\nThe best action is: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 3/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips (from P0 already putting 10 chips as big blind, and you as small blind put 20 chips)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n    *   Your stack: 950 chips\n    *   Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n\n2.  **Action Required**:\n    As P1 (Small Blind), you have posted 20 chips, while P0 (Big Blind) has posted 10 chips. The action is on you to declare your intention of whether to check, raise, or fold. Wait, this cannot be correct. If (P1) is SB, P1 pays 10, and if P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. Then the total pot should be 30. And you are P1(SB), so you just put in 10 chips to be SB. If the current bet is 20, then P0 must have raised it from 20 to 20 or P0 just called it. Since you are the SB and the pot is 30, and you have put in 20 already, P0 has put 10 chips. So P0 must be the BB, and the actual player on action now is P0.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate current player positions and chips.\n    *   Pot: 30 chips (P1 contributed 20 chips, P0 contributed 10 chips)\n    *   P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020 chips (bet 10.00 | active)\n    *   P1 (SB): 950 chips (bet 20.00 | active)\n    *   This means P1 paid the Big Blind (20 chips) and P0 paid the Small Blind (10 chips). And the action is back to P0.\n\n    This setup contradicts the previous hands where P0 was SB and P1 was BB or vice versa. Let's assume the roles are swapped for this hand.\n\n    Let's assume the problem statement means that Player 0 is the SB and Dealer, and Player 1 is the BB and not the dealer. This would mean that P0 has put in 10 chips, and P1 has put in 20 chips. The current bet would be 20 chips because P1 is in the Big Blind position. Since you are P1, you are the Big Blind, you have already put in 20 chips. The action is now on P0 to call, raise, or fold.\n\n    The problem statement specifies \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\". This implies *you* are Player 1.\n    If you are Player 1 (SB), who bet 20 chips, and Player 0 (Dealer/BB) bet 10 chips. The remaining chips, 10, were already contributed by P0.\n    In a classic setup, SB pays 10, BB pays 20. The current bet is 20 for whoever needs to act.\n\n    Let's assume the standard blind structure:\n    - P1 (SB): 10 chips\n    - P0 (BB/Dealer): 20 chips\n\n    The text \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" suggests P1 *is* the Small Blind, but *already bet 20*. This is highly unusual. If P1 is SB, they typically bet 10. If they have bet 20, it implies they raised to 20, and the previous player (P0) called a 10 chip bet, and now P0 is facing a raise to 20.\n\n    Interpretation 1: Standard blinds, but the status read is confusing.\n    - P0 Dealer/BB, P1 SB.\n    - P1 posted 10 (SB).\n    - P0 posted 20 (BB).\n    - P1 has the first action pre-flop after blinds. Pot is 30.\n    - If P1 bet 20, it means P1 raised (from their 10) to 20. So, P1 has already used 20 chips.\n\n    Interpretation 2: Based directly on the provided info, ignoring standard roles if they conflict.\n    - P0 (Dealer/BB): 10.00 chips contributed.\n    - P1 (SB): 20.00 chips contributed.\n    - Current bet: 20.\n    - Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660 (You are P1)\n\n    This means P1 paid 20 (the BB amount) and P0 paid 10 (the SB amount). So P0 is SB and P1 is BB. And P0 is also the Dealer. This means the blinds are reversed from the previous hand, and P1 is indeed the Big Blind.\n    As Big Blind, you have already posted 20 chips. The \"Current bet: 20\" means there has been no raise. The action is now back to Player 0 who is the Small Blind and the Dealer. Player 0 has put in 10, so they need to put in another 10 to call your 20 chip Big Blind.\n\n    So, as P1 (BB), you have already posted your 20 chips, and the action is currently on Player 0, who needs to decide whether to call (an additional 10 to meet your 20), raise, or fold.\n    The prompt \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies the system is waiting for *my* action. This again conflicts with the standard flow where the BB (P1 in this case) acts last pre-flop if no raises occur.\n\n    Let's assume the game is telling me (Player 1) that it's my turn to act, despite being BB, which would only happen if someone *before* me had placed a bet higher than my 20BB. The only player before me (P1 as BB) would be P0 (SB). If P0 bet 20 and I'm at 20, it implies P0 *called* my 20. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\n    Let's re-read the roles and chips:\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n\n    This indicates `P0` is the `Dealer/BB` and has contributed `10`.\n    This indicates `P1` is the `SB` and has contributed `20`.\n    This is a reversal of standard blinds. If P1 is SB, they should contribute 10. If P0 is BB, they should contribute 20.\n    The most logical interpretation for \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\" with \"Current bet: 20\" is that:\n    1. P1 (SB) put in 10 (or was supposed to).\n    2. P0 (BB) put in 20 (or was supposed to). Pot 30.\n    3. Now P1 (SB) is facing the 20 chip \"bet\" (which is the BB amount) from P0 acting as BB.\n    4. P1 has to decide whether to call 10 more chips to match the 20 (total 20 from P1) or raise.\n\n    So, assuming P1 is the SB (10 chips) and P0 is the BB (20 chips) AND P0 is the Dealer.\n    This means the prompt \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" is misrepresenting \"bet 20.00\". It should be \"bet 10.00\" as the SB amount. If it says \"bet 20.00\", it means P1 already put 20 into the pot. This would usually imply that P1 made a raise or the rules are truly unusual.\n\n    Let's rely on the explicit numerical values provided:\n    - You (P1) have made a bet of 20.\n    - P0 has made a bet of 10.\n    - The current highest bet is 20.\n    - The action is on YOU (P1).\n\n    This scenario only makes sense if the blinds are reversed (P1 is BB, P0 is SB) or if P1 (as SB) has already raised to 20, and P0 (as BB) has called 10 (their SB) and now needs to add another 10 to match P1's 20. But the text says P0 is BB (P0 Dealer/BB...bet 10.00) and P1 is SB (P1 SB...bet 20.00).\n\n    This is a contradictory statement in the `` output.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): 1020.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\"\n    If P0 is BB, P0 pays 20. If P1 is SB, P1 pays 10. The sum of blinds is 30. The pot is 30. The \"Current bet: 20\" refers to the highest required contribution. The player whose turn it is needs to match this.\n\n    Given that \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" implies I am P1, and \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00\", it is most likely that as the SB, I have already *raised* to 20. And P0 (BB) has only put in 10. So P0 actually owes 10 to match my bet of 20.\n    But the context implies I am waiting for *my* action.\n\n    Okay, I will assume the provided raw data is exactly what's to be interpreted, even if it contradicts standard game flow.\n    \"P0 (Dealer/BB): ... bet 10.00 | active\"\n    \"P1 (SB): ... bet 20.00 | active\"\n    \"Your hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\" (You are P1)\n    \"Current bet: 20\"\n\n    This means P1 (me, SB) has already put in 20 chips, making the current bet 20. P0 (BB/Dealer) has put in 10 chips. The action is currently on player P0, who needs to match the 20 chip bet.\n    *BUT* if the game is waiting for *my* next action, this implies I am the one who has to make a decision. This can only be true if Player 0 has placed a bet or raise *after* my 20-chip contribution, and I am now facing their action. However, the current bet is still 20, which is what I already contributed.\n\n    This means *I am currently facing a bet of 20 (which is the Big Blind amount).*\n    And \"P1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" means I have already put in 20 chips as SB. This is an unusual situation.\n    The only way this makes sense is if the blind amounts are 20 (SB) and 10 (BB), which is rare but possible, or if the \"bet 20.00\" for P1 is the *total* bet for the round (i.e. P1 raised to 20, and now it's P1's turn).\n\n    Let's assume the blinds are 10 (SB) and 20 (BB).\n    P1 is SB, P0 is BB.\n    P1 posts 10. P0 posts 20. Pot 30.\n    Action is on P1 (SB) to call 10 (to match P0's 20), raise, or fold.\n    In this case, the `bet 20.00` for P1 is the *amount they need to call to bring their total contribution to 20*. So, I've put in 10 chips as SB, and now I need to put in 10 more to call P0's BB of 20 chips.\n\n    3. **Analysis**:\n    - Your hand K\u2666, 7\u2660 is a decent speculative hand. It has high card potential with the King and can make a strong pair if a King hits. There's also a backdoor flush or straight opportunity.\n    - You are the Small Blind (SB), and you've already contributed 10 chips. You are facing the Big Blind's 20-chip bet. To call, you need to add 10 more chips.\n    - This is a standard situation for the small blind.\n\n    4. **Decision**:\n    - With K7s, you are usually looking to play, especially if you can get a good price. Calling 10 chips to see a flop with a hand that has reasonable potential (K high, suitedness, Broadway potential) is often a good play.\n    - Raising would be an option to try to win the blinds immediately or build a bigger pot if you think your hand is strong enough to play for value. However, without knowing P0's tendencies, a call is often safer, especially when out of position post-flop.\n    - Folding would be too conservative for K7s, as you've already invested 10 chips and only need to put in 10 more (1 chip for every 3 in the pot plus your bet).\n\n    5. **Action**:\n    - Call the additional 10 chips to meet the 20 current bet.\n    - To call: `[Call]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Round: Pre-flop\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Player 0 (P0), Dealer, Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your stack: 1020 chips\n   - Your hand: A\u2666, 3\u2665\n   - P1 (SB): 950 chips, bet 20\n\n2. **Action Required**:\n   As P0 (Big Blind/Dealer), you've already posted 10 chips (though it says bet 10, it is likely meant to represent the small blind or an initial contribution). P1 (Small Blind) has raised to 20 chips. You need to decide whether to call the additional 10 chips, raise, or fold.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is A\u2666, 3\u2665. The Ace is a good high card, but the hand is not particularly strong due to the low kicker.\n   - P1 has raised from the Small Blind, indicating potential strength or an attempt to steal.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Calling the additional 10 chips is a reasonable play to see a flop, especially since you have an Ace. The pot odds are somewhat favorable.\n   - Raising would be a 3-bet, which can be a strong play to put pressure on P1, but it requires a stronger hand or a read on P1's tendencies.\n   - Folding is also an option if you think P1's raise is strong.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - To call the additional 10 chips: `[Call]`\n\nThe best action is: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [7\u2663, 5\u2665, 2\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 950.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1]   To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   Hand: 3/10\n    *   Round: Flop\n    *   Pot: 40 chips\n    *   Current bet: 0 chips (no action yet on the flop)\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Small Blind (SB)\n    *   Your stack: 950 chips\n    *   Your hand: K\u2666, 7\u2660\n    *   Visible board: 7\u2663, 5\u2665, 2\u2663\n\n2.  **Analysis**:\n    *   Your hand (K\u2666, 7\u2660) made a pair of sevens with the 7\u2663 on the board.

You are the last to act pre-flop.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   You are in the Big Blind and hold a very weak hand.\n    *   Since no one has raised, you have the option to \"check,\" which means you don't have to put in any more chips to see the flop. This is known as a \"free play\" from the Big Blind.\n    *   Raising with this weak hand would be a pure bluff, which is generally not advisable, especially when out of position post-flop.\n    *   Folding is not necessary as you have the option to check.\n\n4.  **Action**:\n    *   Since you are the Big Blind and the action is on you, and a bet of 20 chips has already been met by P0, you can check to see the flop without investing any more chips.\n\nThe best action is: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 attempted an invalid move. Reason: Cannot check facing a bet. Please resubmit a valid move and remember to follow the game rules to avoid penalties.\n[Player 1]    I apologize for the invalid move. My analysis was flawed regarding the current bet status.\n\nLet me re-evaluate the state and the rules carefully.\n\n1.  **Current State (Re-evaluation)**:\n    *   Hand: 4/10\n    *   Round: Pre-flop\n    *   Pot: 30 chips\n    *   Current bet: 20 chips\n    *   Your position: Player 1 (P1), Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n    *   Your stack: 980 chips\n    *   Your hand: J\u2660, 3\u2663\n\n2.  **Clarification of the previous state and my error**:\n    My previous understanding was that P0 \"called\" the 20 BB. However, the game output \"P0 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\" implies that Player 0, who is the Small Blind, has put in 20 chips. This means P0 *raised* to 20 chips (from their initial 10 SB contribution), making the current bet 20 chips that both players need to match.\n\n    *   Initial blinds: P0 (SB) posts 10, P1 (BB) posts 20. Pot = 30.\n    *   Action is on P0.\n    *   P0 has just raised to 20. This means P0 added 10 more chips to their initial 10.\n    *   Now, you (P1), as the Big Blind, have already contributed 20 chips. So, P0's raise to 20 is exactly what you have in the pot. The \"Current bet: 20\" means that the highest bet is 20, and because you've already matched this 20, you have the option to check, raise, or fold.\n\n    **My previous error was based on the system's previous correction where I was unable to check facing a bet.**\n    The rule states: \"Check when facing a bet is invalid.\"\n    If the current bet is 20, and I (P1) have *already* contributed 20, then I am not \"facing a bet\" in the sense of needing to add more chips. Player 0 has made their contribution to a *total* of 20. Since I have also contributed 20 (my Big Blind), the action is effectively *checked around* to me.\n\n    This means the previous \"Player 0 calls 10\" was referring to P0 calling the *initial* 20 BB, not raising. Let me pull the actual game log:\n    ` ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====`\n    `Pot: 30 | Current bet: 20`\n    `Visible board: []`\n    `P0 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active`\n    `P1 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active`\n    `Your hole: J\u2660, 3\u2663`\n    And what I tried to do was `[Check]`.\n\n    The line `P0 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active` indicates that P0 has *already* bet 20 chips. So, P0 did not \"call 10\", they either paid their 10 SB and then *raised* to 20, or they started with 0 and bet 20.\n    The preceding text was:\n    ` ...The best action is: [Call]` that implies P0 called the 20 (BB).\n    If P0 called the 20, then P0's `bet` column would reflect 20.\n    The issue is: `Current bet: 20`. This means the highest amount anyone has contributed *this betting round* is 20.\n    You (P1, BB) have contributed 10 (as indicated by `bet 10.00`, which is the BB amount in this setup if P0 is SB and P1 is BB, then BB is 20).\n\n    Let's re-confirm the blind structure implied by previous hands and the current state.\n    Hand 1: P0 (BB) 10, P1 (SB) 20. This contradicts my current understanding.\n    Hand 2: P0 (SB) 20, P1 (BB) 10. This is the normal reversal.\n    Hand 3: P0 (BB) 10, P1 (SB) 20. This is the odd one, matches Hand 1 setup.\n    Hand 4: P0 (SB) 20, P1 (BB/Dealer) 10. This means blinds are reversed from standard logic, and the \"bet\" amounts shown are inconsistent with blinds.\n\n    Let's just follow the provided **numerical state variables strictly**:\n    - You are Player 1.\n    - `Pot: 30` (This means 30 chips are already in the pot from blinds/previous action)\n    - `Current bet: 20` (The amount that needs to be matched by anyone making an action to continue)\n    - `P0 (SB): ... bet 20.00` (P0 has put in 20 chips)\n    - `P1 (Dealer/BB): ... bet 10.00` (You have put in 10 chips)\n    - `Your hole: J\u2660, 3\u2663`\n\n    This means P0 (Small Blind) made a bet of 20 chips.\n    You (P1, Big Blind/Dealer) have only put in 10 chips so far.\n    To continue in the hand, you need to match the 'Current bet: 20'.\n    Since you have only put in 10, you need to add an *additional 10 chips* to call P0's bet.\n\n    My previous analysis of \"effectively checked around\" was fundamentally incorrect because my 'bet' amount was 10, not 20. I *am* indeed \"facing a bet\" of 20, and I have only contributed 10.\n\n3.  **Analysis (Corrected)**:\n    *   You (P1) are the Big Blind. You have contributed 10 chips (potentially the Small Blind was 10 and you were BB 20, but the `bet 10.00` is the amount currently attributed to you).\n    *   P0, who is listed as SB, has contributed 20 chips. This means P0 has either posted 20 as their blind or they raised to 20 from a 10 blind.\n    *   In any case, the `Current bet` for anyone to continue is 20.\n    *   You have already contributed 10 chips. So, you need to put in an *additional 10 chips* to call P0's bet of 20.\n    *   Your hand is J\u2660, 3\u2663, which is a very weak hand. It has very little potential.\n\n4.  **Decision (Corrected)**:\n    *   You are facing a bet of 20 chips, and you only have 10 chips invested. You need to put in 10 more chips to call.\n    *   Given your very weak hand (J\u2660, 3\u2663), calling 10 more chips would be a poor decision. Your hand has very little equity to win the pot.\n    *   Raising would be an even worse decision, as it would commit more chips to a very low-probability hand.\n    *   The best action is to fold, thereby minimizing your losses and saving your chips for better hands.\n\n5.  **Action (Corrected)**:\n    *   Fold to P0's bet.\n\nThe best action is: `[Fold]`",
