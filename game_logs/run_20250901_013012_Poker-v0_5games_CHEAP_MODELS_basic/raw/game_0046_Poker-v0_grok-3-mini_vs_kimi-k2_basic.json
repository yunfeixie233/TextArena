It's not worth the risk, so I'll fold to conserve chips.  \n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 70 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 9\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] With my hole cards of 3\u2666 and 9\u2665, I have a weak, unsuited hand with no high cards, pairs, or drawing potential. As the Small Blind, I've already posted my blind, but the risk of continuing with such a marginal hand isn't justified, especially with no immediate equity against potential raises. I'll fold to conserve chips.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 920.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1050.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 10\u2663, 2\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2660, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====  \nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20  \nVisible board: []  \nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active  \nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active  \nYour hole: K\u2660, 2\u2666  \n==============================================  \nWith my hole cards of K\u2660 and 2\u2666, I have a King-high hand, which is marginally better than my previous weak hands as SB. The pot is small at 30, and I've already posted my 20 chips. There's no raise from BB, so I'll check to see if I can take a cheap flop and potentially improve, while minimizing risk.  \n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1] Checking behind with K\u2665 4\u2663 is the best way to see a flop on a free card and still beat a large portion of the opponent\u2019s range.\n\n[Check]\n[Player 1] I\u2019m facing a bet of 20 (Player 0\u2019s small-blind post) and the action is on me last. Since only the 20-chip bet is live, I must either:\n\n- fold (lose the 10 already put in as big blind),  \n- or call 20 to see the flop.\n\nWith K\u26654\u2663 offsuit, King-high is ahead of much of the SB\u2019s wide check range; the pot is 30-to-call-20 (1.5 : 1). That\u2019s a favorable price, and folding would give the SB the pot for free most of the time.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2665, 3\u2663, J\u2665]\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2660, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Flop =====  \nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0  \nVisible board: [9\u2665, 3\u2663, J\u2665]  \nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active  \nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active  \nYour hole: K\u2660, 2\u2666  \n==============================================  \n With my hole cards of K\u2660 and 2\u2666 on a flop of 9\u2665, 3\u2663, and J\u2665, I have King-high, which is a weak hand with no pairs, draws, or improvements from the board. The pot is 40, and checking allows me to see another card without committing more chips, while gauging my opponent's strength.  \n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1]  I have K\u26654\u2663 on a 9\u2665 3\u2663 J\u2665 flop.  King-high is still ahead of a lot of the SB\u2019s range, and there\u2019s a possible back-door flush with the K\u2665.  The pot is 40 and the action is checked to me.  A 2\u20443-pot stab should take it down most of the time.\n\n[Bet 25]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 25.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 65 | Current bet: 25\nVisible board: [9\u2665, 3\u2663, J\u2665]\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1005.00 chips | bet 25.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2660, 2\u2666\n==============================================",

Player 1's bet of 25 into a pot of 65 suggests they have a stronger hand, possibly a pair or a draw, and my equity is likely too low to justify calling (risking 25 to win 65, but with minimal outs). Continuing would be unprofitable, so I'll fold to conserve my remaining chips.  \n\n[Fold]",
