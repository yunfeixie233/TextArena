      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\n- Current resources and their values:\n  - Wheat: 10 units, Value: 6\n  - Wood: 10 units, Value: 8\n  - Sheep: 5 units, Value: 12\n  - Brick: 17 units, Value: 22\n  - Ore: 10 units, Value: 39\n\n- Total value of current resources = (10*6) + (10*8) + (5*12) + (17*22) + (10*39)\n  = 60 + 80 + 60 + 374 + 390\n  = 964\n\n### Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value of resources, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given the current values:\n- The most valuable resource is Ore (Value: 39).\n- The least valuable resources are Wheat (Value: 6) and Wood (Value: 8).\n\n### Initial Trade Offer\n\nWe should start by offering resources of lower value in exchange for resources of higher value or at least maintaining the value while potentially gaining from the quantity or diversity of resources.\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n1. Offering Wheat or Wood for more valuable resources like Sheep, Brick, or Ore.\n   \n### Trade Offer\n\nGiven that Sheep, Brick, and Ore are more valuable, let's consider offering Wheat or Wood for any of these.\n\nLet's make an initial offer: '[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 2 Sheep, 1 Ore]'.\n\nThis offer gives away:\n- 5 Wheat = 5 * 6 = 30 value\n- 5 Wood = 5 * 8 = 40 value\n- Total given = 30 + 40 = 70 value\n\nAnd requests:\n- 2 Sheep = 2 * 12 = 24 value\n- 1 Ore = 1 * 39 = 39 value\n- Total requested = 24 + 39 = 63 value\n\nThe initial offer might not be favorable as it stands since we're giving away more value than we're getting. Let's adjust our strategy.\n\n### Revised Trade Offer\n\nLet's directly propose a more balanced or slightly advantageous trade.\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' is not favorable due to the value difference (30 for 39).\n\nA more balanced approach could be to offer resources that are closer in value or to negotiate for a better deal.\n\n### Action\n\nLet's think about making a more reasonable offer:\n'[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'.\n\n- Giving: 4 Wood (4*8 = 32) + 2 Wheat (2*6 = 12) = 44 value\n- Getting: 1 Ore (1*39 = 39) = 39 value\n\nThis is still not ideal. Let's adjust:\n'[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'.\n\n- Giving: 3 Wood (3*8 = 24) + 1 Wheat (1*6 = 6) = 30 value\n- Getting: 1 Ore (1*39 = 39) = 39 value\n\nThis is a more reasonable trade as it involves less disparity.\n\n### Initial Response\n\n'[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.",

Let's propose a trade that could potentially be beneficial based on our current holdings and the hope that Player 1 might be interested or have what we need.\n\nFor example, offering some Wheat or Wood for more valuable resources could be a strategy.\n\nLet's make a new offer:\n'[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]'\n\nThis translates to: '[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]'.\n\nSo, my action is: \n'[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]'",

The third trade requested more valuable resources (Ore and Sheep) for Brick, which might be too costly for the opponent. The fourth trade requested Ore for Sheep and Wood; again, it seems the opponent didn't find it favorable.\n\n5. **Next Trade**:\n   - We need to think about what we can offer that is less valuable and what we can request that is more valuable.\n   - One potential trade could involve offering some of our less valuable resources (Wheat, Wood) for more valuable ones (Ore).\n\nGiven the current quantities and the goal to increase the total value, let's formulate a new offer.\n\n### New Offer\n\nLet's offer some Wheat (one of our less valuable resources) for Ore (one of the most valuable resources).\n\n- **[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]**\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's send this offer to Player 1.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]` is adjusted to fit the available quantity, so we actually use: `[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]` \n\nThe final action is: `[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`",
