      "response": "[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]  \n\nWhy this offer?  \n- I'm trading 3 Wheat (which I value at 5 each, **total of 15**) for 1 Sheep (valued at **16**). This gives me a net gain of +1 in value.  \n- Wheat is my lowest-value resource (5) and I have plenty (19 units), making it an ideal candidate to trade away. Sheep, while not the highest-value, still represents a gain per unit received compared to what I give.  \n- Starting with a smaller, low-risk trade allows me to gauge the opponent's responses without overcommitting early. This could open opportunities for more valuable trades in later turns.  \n\nLet's negotiate! What do you say?",

That's close.\nOr 1 Ore (value 37) -> 1 Brick (value 30) + 2 Wheat (value 10) = 40.

My Wheat (11) is also lowish.\n\nWhat about trading Wood for Brick or Ore?\n10 Wood for 1 Brick (value 30)? Value for me 10, value for them 30. Bad.\nWhat if I offer a resource I have plenty of at a good rate for them, to get something valuable that I need more of?\n\nLet's try offering my plentiful Ore for a good amount of the scarcer but valuable Brick.\nIf I offer 2 Ore (value 74), I could ask for 2 Brick (value 60) and some other valuable resource.\nThat seems like a loss for me too.\n\nLet's focus on getting Brick, as it is relatively scarce for me and high in value.\n\nCurrent resources:\nWheat: 11 (5)\nWood: 12 (10)\nSheep: 14 (13)\nBrick: 6 (30)\nOre: 22 (37)\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep (26) -> 1 Brick (30)\nThis offers 26 value for 30 value. Gain of 4.\nI have plenty of sheep. This seems like a reasonable offer for Player 0 as well.\n\nAlternatively:\nOffer: 3 Wood (30) -> 1 Brick (30)\nThis is a neutral value trade. But Brick is a resource I want more of, and Wood is something I have a decent quantity of. This might be acceptable.\n\nLet's go with an offer where I clearly gain value.\nOffer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick\nMy value: 2 Sheep = 2 * 13 = 26\nTheir value: 1 Brick = 30\nThis nets me +4 value.

Given Player 1 previously accepted a trade of 2 Sheep for 1 Brick but recently rejected 1 Brick for 2 Sheep, I'll offer a slightly improved deal by adding Wheat to incentivize acceptance.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]",
