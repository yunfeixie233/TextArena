Player 1 has offered resources that do not currently align with the resources Player 0 needs, so let's forward a new offer to maximize value.\n\nConsidering the present resources Player 0 has and the overall value, a valid strategic move might be to offer 4 Sheep (which Player 0 has) in exchange for 2 Ore from Player 1.\n\nLet's proceed with the following offer:\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
