I can leverage my ample supply of Brick and a few other resources to formulate a more appealing offer. \n\n### Next Offer Proposal:\nI will propose the following offer:\n- **Offered items**: 4 Brick\n- **Requested items**: 3 Wood, 2 Ore\n\n### Turn Action:\nMake the offer to Player 1.\n\n**Offer:** [Offer: 4 Brick -> 3 Wood, 2 Ore]",
