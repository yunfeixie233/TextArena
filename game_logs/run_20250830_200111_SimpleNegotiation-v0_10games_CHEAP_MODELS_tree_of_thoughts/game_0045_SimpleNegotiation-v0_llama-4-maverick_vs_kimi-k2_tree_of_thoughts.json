      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to analyze the current situation and decide on the best course of action for the first turn.\n\nInitially, I have:\n- Wheat: 17 units, Value: 6\n- Wood: 9 units, Value: 9\n- Sheep: 17 units, Value: 13\n- Brick: 10 units, Value: 23\n- Ore: 21 units, Value: 40\n\nLet's calculate the total value of my current resources:\n- Wheat: 17 * 6 = 102\n- Wood: 9 * 9 = 81\n- Sheep: 17 * 13 = 221\n- Brick: 10 * 23 = 230\n- Ore: 21 * 40 = 840\n\nTotal value = 102 + 81 + 221 + 230 + 840 = 1474\n\nTo increase the total value, I need to make trades that give me more value than I give away. Let's examine potential trades.\n\n1. **Assessing Resources and Their Values:**\n   - The highest value resource I have is Ore (Value: 40).\n   - The lowest value resource I have is Wheat (Value: 6).\n\n2. **Potential Trades:**\n   - I could offer some Wheat (low value) in exchange for higher value resources or more quantity of the same or lower value resources if it leads to a beneficial subsequent trade.\n\nGiven the resources and their values, one potential strategy is to try and trade my lower-value resources or excess resources for higher-value ones. However, without knowing my opponent's resources, I'll have to make a somewhat informed guess.\n\nOne possible trade could involve offering Wheat (since it's the lowest value resource) in exchange for something more valuable or the same resource to potentially trade it later for something better.\n\nFor the first turn, let's make an offer that involves trading some of my Wheat for another resource that could potentially be valuable or easily tradable.\n\n**Offer:** '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood]' is not likely to be beneficial as Wood is not significantly more valuable. Let's consider something that might be more appealing.\n\nLet's directly consider making an offer that involves trading a less valuable resource for a potentially more valuable one or a resource that could be in demand.\n\n**My Action for Turn 1:**\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick]' \n\nThis offer involves giving away some Wheat (lower value) and Sheep (moderate value) for Brick (higher value than both Wheat and Sheep). The calculation is as follows:\n- Giving away: (5 * 6) + (2 * 13) = 30 + 26 = 56 value\n- Receiving: 3 * 23 = 69 value\n\nThis results in a net gain of 69 - 56 = 13 value.\n\nLet's make this offer to see how my opponent responds.\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick]'",

      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAfter the first round of negotiation, the current state of resources for Player 0 is as follows:\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Initially 17, sent 5 to Player 1. Remaining quantity = 17 - 5 = **12**. Value = 6.\n- **[Wood]**: Initially 9, received 1 from Player 1. New quantity = 9 + 1 = **10**. Value = 9.\n- **[Sheep]**: Quantity = **17**. Value = 13.\n- **[Brick]**: Quantity = **10**. Value = 23.\n- **[Ore]**: Quantity = **21**. Value = 40.\n\n### Total Value Calculation\n\nTo understand the current total value of resources:\n- **[Wheat] (12)**: 12 * 6 = 72.\n- **[Wood] (10)**: 10 * 9 = 90.\n- **[Sheep] (17)**: 17 * 13 = 221.\n- **[Brick] (10)**: 10 * 23 = 230.\n- **[Ore] (21)**: 21 * 40 = 840.\n\nTotal value = 72 + 90 + 221 + 230 + 840 = **1453**.\n\n### Negotiation Strategy for Turn 2\n\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources. To achieve this, we need to identify which resources are undervalued or overvalued relative to others and make a trade that benefits Player 0.\n\n### Potential Trades\n\n1. **Consider Trading Wheat for Higher Value Resources**: Wheat is valued at 6. Trading it for resources with higher values could be beneficial.\n2. **Consider Trading for More Valuable Resources or Increasing Quantity of High-Value Resources**: Resources like Ore are highly valued. Increasing their quantity or acquiring more valuable resources could be beneficial.\n\n### Trade Offer for Turn 2\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- Trading **[Wheat]** for **[Ore]** or other high-value resources could be beneficial because Wheat is relatively less valuable.\n- **[Sheep]** could potentially be traded for a resource of higher total value.\n\nGiven the current state and values, a potential trade could involve offering **[Wheat]** or **[Sheep]** in exchange for **[Ore]** or maintaining/increasing the quantity of other relatively high-value resources like **[Brick]**.\n\nLet's propose a trade:\n- Offer: **[4 Sheep]** (valued at 4*13 = 52) in exchange for **[2 Ore]** (valued at 2*40 = 80). This is a potentially beneficial trade as it increases the total value.\n\n### Action for Turn 2\n\n`[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore]`\n\nThis trade is expected to increase the total value of resources for Player 0.

Wheat is the least valuable. We could offer Wheat for a more valuable resource.\n\n## Step 6: Formulate a trade offer based on the current resources and their values.\nLet's offer Wheat for Ore since Ore is very valuable. We could offer 5 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n\n## Step 7: Check if the proposed trade is beneficial.\nCurrent value: (7*6) + (10*9) + (13*13) + (9*23) + (20*40) = 42 + 90 + 169 + 207 + 800 = 1308. If we offer 5 Wheat for 1 Ore: New value = (2*6) + (10*9) + (13*13) + (9*23) + (21*40) = 12 + 90 + 169 + 207 + 840 = 1318. This is a gain.\n\n## Step 8: Decide on the action to take based on the formulated trade offer.\nThe trade offer is: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore].\n\n## Step 9: Check if Player 1 has made a new trade offer.\nAccording to the information, Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n\n## Step 10: Finalize the action for this turn.\nSince we have a potential trade that increases our total value, we will make the offer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]}$",
