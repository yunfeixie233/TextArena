      "response": "I am Player 1.\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources.\nMy current resources are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 12   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 16   Value: 8\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 14   Value: 12\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 15   Value: 29\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 5    Value: 34\n\nThe opponent (Player 0) rejected all previous offers.\nPlayer 0 just offered: Offered items: 5 Brick, 3 Sheep -> Requested items: 8 Wood\n\nLet's calculate the value of Player 0's offer:\nValue of \"5 Brick\" = 5 * 29 = 145\nValue of \"3 Sheep\" = 3 * 12 = 36\nTotal offered value = 145 + 36 = 181\n\nValue of \"8 Wood\" = 8 * 8 = 64\n\nThis offer is not good for me as I would be giving up more value than I receive. I will reject this offer.\n\nI want to acquire more Ore as it has the highest value. I could offer Brick as it is quite valuable and I have a good quantity of it.\n\nI have 15 Brick (value 29 each) and 5 Ore (value 34 each).\nIf I offer 2 Brick (2 * 29 = 58), I could request 1 Ore (1 * 34 = 34). This gives me Ore, but I lose value.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (3 * 29 = 87), I could request 2 Ore (2 * 34 = 68). I still lose value.\n\nWhat about Sheep? I have 14 Sheep (value 12 each).\nIf I offer 5 Sheep (5 * 12 = 60), I could request 1 Ore (34). Still losing.\n\nLet's try to get Ore by offering Wood directly. I have 16 Wood (value 8 each).\nIf I offer 4 Wood (4 * 8 = 32), I could request 1 Ore (34). This is a pretty close trade value wise, and I get the high value Ore.\nIf I offer 8 Wood (8 * 8 = 64), I could request 2 Ore (2 * 34 = 68). This is an even better deal for me.\nMy previous offer of \"8 Wood -> 2 Ore\" was rejected, so maybe Player 0 needs Wood.\n\nLet's consider trading for Brick. I have 15 Brick.\nI want to increase value, so I should try to trade less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\nI have a good quantity of Sheep (14) and Wheat (12).\n\nIf I offer Wheat for Brick:\n1 Wheat (5) vs 1 Brick (29) - impossible to balance.\nNeed to offer many Wheat for few Brick.\nE.g., 5 Wheat (5*5=25) for 1 Brick (29). Good for me, but the other player might not accept.\n\nLet's stick to acquiring Ore.\nI have 15 Brick, 5 Ore.\nI have 16 Wood.\n\nMy last offer of \"8 Wood -> 2 Ore\" was rejected.\nWhat if Player 0 needs Brick more than I thought?\nWhat if I try to get Ore by offering a mix of resources?\n\nMaybe Player 0 wants Wheat or Sheep.\nLet's try to get Ore. Ore is the most valuable.\nI am low on Ore (only 5).\nIf I offer 3 Brick (3*29=87) for 2 Ore (2*34=68), I lose value but gain critical resource.\nBut 2 Ore is 68. 8 Wood is 64. That offer looked like a good deal for me.\n\nPlayer 0 has rejected previous offers. Maybe they need something else.\nMy total value is (12*5) + (16*8) + (14*12) + (15*29) + (5*34) = 60 + 128 + 168 + 435 + 170 = 961.\n\nLet's re-evaluate player 0's offer: 5 Brick, 3 Sheep -> 8 Wood\nPlayer 0 offers 5*29 + 3*12 = 145 + 36 = 181\nPlayer 0 requests 8*8 = 64\nThis offer is extremely bad for me. I deny it.\n\nLet me try to offer something that could be good for Player 0 too by having less advantage for me.\nI want Ore. Player 0 has rejected my Ore requests.\nLet me offer 5 Brick for 2 Ore.\nValue offer: 5*29 = 145\nValue request: 2*34 = 68\nThis is not a good offer for me at all, but indicates I strongly want Ore. Maybe I can adjust later.\nThis is too much to offer.\n\nLet's try selling what I have in abundance and what is low value.\nWheat: 12 Qty, 5 Value\nWood: 16 Qty, 8 Value\nSheep: 14 Qty, 12 Value\n\nI have 16 Wood. If I want to get Brick (29) or Ore (34).\nOffer 8 Wood (64) -> 2 Ore (68). I will try this again. It's a slight loss but gives me the most valuable resource.\nI have 15 Brick. I can give up some Brick.\nMaybe I could trade away Brick for Ore.\nValue of 1 Brick is 29. Value of 1 Ore is 34.\nSo giving 1 Brick for 1 Ore is good for me. But Player 0 would not do that.\nIf I ask for 2 Ore, that's 68.\nIf I offer 2 Brick (58) for 2 Ore (68). That's a good deal for me.\n\nThe last offer from P0 was 5 Brick, 3 Sheep -> 8 Wood.\nI will reject it.\n\nI will make my next offer.\nConsidering I have many Wood, and Ore is valuable.\nI offered 8 Wood for 2 Ore before and it was rejected.\nWhat about offering some Wood and some Sheep to get Ore?\n8 Wood (64) + 2 Sheep (24) = 88\nFor 2 Ore (68), I'm losing too much.\n\nLet us try to gain value.\nI have 12 Wheat (value 5). Player 0 might need Wheat.\nI have 16 Wood (value 8).\nI have 14 Sheep (value 12).\nI have 15 Brick (value 29). I should use Brick to get Ore.\nI have 5 Ore (value 34).\n\nLet's offer 3 Brick for 2 Ore.\nOffered value = 3 * 29 = 87\nRequested value = 2 * 34 = 68\nThis is a bad trade for me from a value perspective but I get more Ore.\nIt's too much of a loss.\n\nWhat if I offer Brick to get something valuable like Sheep or Wood, if I can do it with a gain?\nE.g., 1 Brick (29) for 3 Sheep (3*12 = 36). That's a good trade for me, because I gain 7 in value.\nI will propose this, as I have sufficient Brick.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep]",
