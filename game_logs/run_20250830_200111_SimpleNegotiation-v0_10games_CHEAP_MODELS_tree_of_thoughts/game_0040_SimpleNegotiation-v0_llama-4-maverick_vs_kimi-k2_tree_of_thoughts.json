      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to assess the current situation and decide on the best course of action. Let's first calculate the total value of my current resources.\n\n1. Wheat: 17 * 5 = 85\n2. Wood: 7 * 9 = 63\n3. Sheep: 6 * 16 = 96\n4. Brick: 6 * 21 = 126\n5.

Given the values, Ore is the most valuable resource, and I have a significant quantity of it. However, giving away too much Ore might not be wise as it's the most valuable. Let's consider other resources.\n\nAt the start, I should make an offer that could potentially increase my total value. One strategy is to look for opportunities to get more of the higher-value resources (Ore, Brick, Sheep) by giving away some of the lower-value ones (Wheat, Wood).\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n\n1. Giving away Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 9) for more valuable resources could be a good start.\n\nFor Turn 1, I will propose a trade that involves giving away some Wheat (the lowest value resource per unit) in exchange for Brick or Sheep, as they are relatively more valuable.\n\nLet's make an offer: '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'.\n\nThis means I am willing to give away 5 Wheat (Value: 5 * 5 = 25) in exchange for 1 Sheep (Value: 16).

      "response": "### Game State Analysis\nWe have completed one turn of the Negotiation Game. Let's analyze the current state:\n\n1. **Initial Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 17, Value: 5\n   - Wood: 7, Value: 9\n   - Sheep: 6, Value: 16\n   - Brick: 6, Value: 21\n   - Ore: 19, Value: 40\n\n2. **Trade Made in Turn 1:**\n   - Offered: 5 Wheat\n   - Received: 1 Sheep\n\n3. **New Resource Quantities and Total Values:**\n   - Wheat: 17 - 5 = 12, Value: 5\n   - Wood: 7, Value: 9\n   - Sheep: 6 + 1 = 7, Value: 16\n   - Brick: 6, Value: 21\n   - Ore: 19, Value: 40\n   \n   Total initial value = (17*5) + (7*9) + (6*16) + (6*21) + (19*40) = 85 + 63 + 96 + 126 + 760 = 1130\n   Total value after trade = (12*5) + (7*9) + (7*16) + (6*21) + (19*40) = 60 + 63 + 112 + 126 + 760 = 1121\n   \n   The total value of resources decreased by 9 after the first trade.\n\n### Next Action\nTo increase the total value, we need to make a trade that gives us more valuable resources or the same value with a more favorable quantity. Let's reassess our resources and think about potential trades.\n\nWe should look for opportunities to trade less valuable resources for more valuable ones. For instance, we could consider trading some of our Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 9) for resources with higher values like Sheep (Value: 16), Brick (Value: 21), or Ore (Value: 40).\n\nLet's make a new offer. We can offer some Wheat or Wood for a more valuable resource. For example, offering 4 Wood for 1 Brick could be a good start because it potentially increases our total value (4*9 = 36 for 1*21 = 21 is not beneficial, so we need to think of a better trade).\n\nLet's think about a reasonable trade:\n- We can offer 3 Wheat (Value: 5 * 3 = 15) for 1 Brick (Value: 21). This increases our total value by 6.\n\nThus, the proposed trade is: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`.\n\n### Turn 2 Action\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 1 Brick, 0 Ore]` simplifies to `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`. \n\nLet's execute this action.\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`",
