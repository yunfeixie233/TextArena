Let's propose:\n\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]'\n\nThis offer aims to increase the quantity of Sheep, which is more valuable than Wheat.\n\nLet's see the response from the opponent.\n\n### Action\n\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]'",

      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the current state of resources and the game's progress.\nThe current resources and their values are: Wheat (Qty: 21, Value: 5), Wood (Qty: 14, Value: 8), Sheep (Qty: 13, Value: 18), Brick (Qty: 6, Value: 26), Ore (Qty: 17, Value: 38). The game is ongoing, with 10 turns in total. The previous offers and counteroffers have been made, with the last offer being from Player 1 to Player 0: 5 Wood -> 2 Sheep.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the last offer made by Player 1.\nPlayer 1's offer is 5 Wood -> 2 Sheep. The value of 5 Wood is 5 * 8 = 40, and the value of 2 Sheep is 2 * 18 = 36. Since 40 (value of Wood) is greater than 36 (value of Sheep), this offer is not favorable to Player 0.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the current resources and potential trades.\nTo increase the total value of resources, we need to consider what we have and what we can offer or request. We have a significant amount of Wheat and Ore, which are relatively high in quantity but vary in value.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze possible trades based on current resources and their values.\nWe can consider offering resources that are less valuable to us and requesting resources that are more valuable. For example, offering Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 8) for more valuable resources like Sheep (Value: 18), Brick (Value: 26), or Ore (Value: 38).\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a new trade offer based on the analysis.\nGiven that we have 21 Wheat and the last offer was not favorable, we could try to offer some Wheat for a more valuable resource. Since Sheep is more valuable than Wheat, offering Wheat for Sheep could be beneficial. Let's consider offering 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep. The value given is 4 * 5 = 20, and the value received is 1 * 18 = 18. This is not favorable as it results in a loss of value.\n\n## Step 6: Reconsider the offer made by Player 1 and think about a counteroffer.\nSince Player 1's last offer was not in our favor, we need to think about what we can offer in return that would be more acceptable. Let's directly analyze the resources: We can offer Ore for a valuable resource or try to negotiate with what we have.\n\n## Step 7: Decide on a counteroffer to Player 1.\nLet's offer 1 Ore (Value: 38) for 2 Sheep (Value: 2 * 18 = 36). The offer would be: 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep. This translates to: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep].\n\n## Step 8: Formulate the action in the required format.\nThe action is to make a new offer: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep].\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep]}$",

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first assess the current state of our resources and the history of trades.\n\nInitially, we have:\n- Wheat: 21 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 14 (Value: 8)\n- Sheep: 13 (Value: 18)\n- Brick: 6 (Value: 26)\n- Ore: 17 (Value: 38)\n\nTotal initial value = (21*5) + (14*8) + (13*18) + (6*26) + (17*38) = 105 + 112 + 234 + 156 + 646 = 1253\n\nWe've made several offers to Player 1, all of which were rejected. The offers were:\n1. 10 Wheat -> 2 Sheep\n2. 5 Wood -> 1 Sheep\n3. 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep\n\nAnd we received an offer from Player 1:\n1. 5 Wood -> 2 Sheep (which we rejected)\n\nLet's analyze the offers we've made and the response:\n- We offered 10 Wheat for 2 Sheep. The value given up is 10*5 = 50, and the value gained is 2*18 = 36. This is a bad trade for us.\n- We offered 5 Wood for 1 Sheep. The value given up is 5*8 = 40, and the value gained is 1*18 = 18. This is also not favorable.\n- We offered 1 Ore for 2 Sheep. The value given up is 1*38 = 38, and the value gained is 2*18 = 36. Again, not favorable.\n\nNow, let's consider Player 1's offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Sheep.\n- Value given up by us (if we accept) = 2*18 = 36 (for Sheep)\n- Value gained by us = 5*8 = 40 (for Wood)\nThis trade is slightly favorable because we gain more value than we give up.\n\nConsidering our current resources:\n- Wheat: 21 - 10 = 11\n- Wood: 14 - 5 = 9\n- Sheep: 13\n- Brick: 6\n- Ore: 17 - 1 = 16\n\nAfter our last offer, our resources are:\n- Wheat: 11\n- Wood: 9\n- Sheep: 13\n- Brick: 6\n- Ore: 16\n\nLet's directly analyze our next step.\n\nGiven that our previous offers were not accepted and considering the last offer from Player 1 (5 Wood -> 2 Sheep), which we rejected, let's reassess if accepting it would be beneficial.\n\nAccepting Player 1's offer (5 Wood -> 2 Sheep) would mean:\n- We give up 2 Sheep (2*18 = 36 value)\n- We get 5 Wood (5*8 = 40 value)\n\nThis is a slightly positive trade for us. However, we need to consider if we should make a new offer or react to the current situation.\n\nSince we've been trying to get Sheep and our offers were rejected, let's directly consider making a new offer that might be more appealing or think about accepting a trade that is beneficial.\n\nLet's directly make a new offer that could be beneficial.\n\nConsidering our resources and the value, let's make a new offer. We have been trying to get Sheep, so let's think about what we can offer that might be more appealing to Player 1.\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore, 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep]\n\nThis offer gives up (2*38) + (1*26) = 76 + 26 = 102 value and requests 3*18 = 54 value. This is not a good trade for us. Let's rethink.\n\nLet's directly analyze the possibility of accepting or making a more reasonable offer.\n\nSince our task is to increase the total value of our resources, let's directly consider an alternative.\n\nGiven the current state and previous rejections, let's directly consider an alternative action.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n- Giving up 4 Wheat = 4*5 = 20\n- Gaining 1 Sheep = 1*18 = 18\n\nThis is still not very favorable. Let's adjust our strategy.\n\nLet's directly consider another action.\n\nWe can analyze the trades again and directly propose a more reasonable action.\n\nAfter re-evaluating, a more reasonable action could be to directly make a trade that gives us a better value.\n\nLet's think about making a new offer that involves resources we have in abundance relative to their value and try to get something more valuable.\n\nLet's directly propose: \n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Sheep]\n\nValue given up = 4*8 = 32\nValue gained = 1*18 = 18\n\nThis is still not very favorable.\n\nLet's directly make a more reasonable offer.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep]\n\nValue given up = (3*5) + (1*8) = 15 + 8 = 23\nValue gained = 2*18 = 36\n\nThis seems like a potentially more acceptable trade.\n\nLet's go with it.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep]",

Rejected.\n   - You offered 5 Wood for 1 Sheep. Rejected.\n   - Player 1 offered 5 Wood for 2 Sheep. You rejected.\n   - You offered 1 Ore for 2 Sheep. Rejected.\n   - You offered 2 Ore and 1 Brick for 3 Sheep. Rejected.\n   - Player 1 offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The last offer from Player 1 is 2 Sheep for 1 Ore. Let's evaluate it:\n     - You have 17 Ore, and giving up 1 Ore means losing 38 value.\n     - You gain 2 Sheep, which means gaining 2 * 18 = 36 value.\n     - The trade is not favorable as it results in a net loss of 2 value.\n\n4. **Decision for the Next Turn:**\n   - Considering your goal is to increase the total value of your resources, you need to either come up with a new offer that is more favorable or accept an offer that is beneficial.\n   - The last offer from Player 1 (2 Sheep for 1 Ore) is not beneficial. You should either make a counteroffer or propose a new trade.\n\n5. **New Offer:**\n   - Observing the values and quantities, Sheep is relatively valuable to you and so is Ore. You have a surplus of Wheat and a decent amount of Wood.\n   - A possible strategy is to try to get more of the higher-value resources (Sheep, Brick, Ore) by offering the lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood).\n\n6. **Proposed Action:**\n   - Let's propose a new trade that involves giving away some Wheat or Wood for Sheep or Brick, as these are higher in value.\n   - Considering the previous rejections and the values, a potential offer could be: `[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Sheep]`. This is more Sheep than previously requested and could be seen as a more substantial trade.\n   - Alternatively, you could also consider offering Wood for Sheep or Brick: `[Offer: 6 Wood -> 1 Sheep]` or `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Brick]`.\n\n7. **Action:**\n   Given the above analysis, a reasonable next step is to make a new offer. Let's go with `[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]`. This is a compromise between the initial offer and the need to negotiate.\n\nThus, the action for this turn is: `[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]`.",
