Let\u2019s try to package them toward more Ore while topping up an item Player 1 has already demonstrated interest in (Brick).\n\nI\u2019m going to offer a package that contains plenty of Brick and Sheep (my over-supplies) plus some extra Wood/Wheat for 3 Ore:  \nPlayer 1 values Ore highly enough not to give it for 2 Brick, so let\u2019s try: 5 Brick + 2 Sheep + 1 Wheat \u2192 3 Ore.\n\nPrice check:  \n- Giving: 5\u00d724 + 2\u00d715 + 1\u00d75 = 120 + 30 + 5 = 155  \n- Getting: 3\u00d736 = 108  \nThat is a loss in raw numbers; to move to a gain we must adjust.\n\nAlternative mix: 5 Brick worth 120 alone equals 108 only when we add some quantity of Ore to return or ask for.\n\nI can offer 4 Brick + 2 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore \u2013 this is 96 + 30 = 126 vs 72; still lossy.\n\nNext best: recognize my Sheep is the worst-valued part (15) relative to brick/wheat and see if I can move Sheep for Ore.\n\nHow about 3 Sheep (45) + 2 Brick (48) \u2192 2 Ore (72) ? 93 vs 72 \u2013 still a loss.\n\nRealistically I over-cut.  Instead let me give a lean bundle of mixed low-end:\n\n2 Brick + 2 Sheep + 1 Wood = 48 + 30 + 8 = 86 asking 2 Ore (72) ?  Still 14 value down.\n\nRealizing the Player 1 likely values brick somewhat lower than 24 (experimental data says he\u2019ll sell 1 ore for 2 brick), I decide the break-even for him might sit around 2.5-3 Brick per Ore.  Since I have 14 bricks, I don\u2019t mind shaving a bit.\n\nTry the lightest possible attractive offer:\n\n3 Brick + 1 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore  \nThat\u2019s 72 + 15 = 87 vs 72. If Player 1 values brick at 24 and ore at 36, he\u2019d see  \n6 brick : 4 ore parity, but 3 brick : 2 ore = 72 : 72 parity according to his assumed standard, so he might take it, and for me it keeps raw value neutral while shifting out excess brick.\n\nThat appears acceptable.\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
