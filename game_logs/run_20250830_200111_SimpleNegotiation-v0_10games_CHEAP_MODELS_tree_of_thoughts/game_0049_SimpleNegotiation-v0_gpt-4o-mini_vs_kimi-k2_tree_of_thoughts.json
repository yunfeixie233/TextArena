Looking at the values:\n\n- My current total value: (18\u00d76) + (25\u00d79) + (22\u00d714) + (15\u00d730) + (8\u00d734) = 108 + 225 + 308 + 450 + 272 = 1,363\n\nIn the trades:\n1. In turn 1, I accepted 3 Sheep + 2 Ore for 5 Brick + 2 Sheep. This effectively got me:\n   - Gave: 2 Sheep, 5 Brick (2\u00d714 + 5\u00d730 = 28 + 150 = 178 value)\n   - Received: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore (3\u00d714 + 2\u00d734 = 42 + 68 = 110 value)\n   - Net loss: -68 value - this was a bad trade!\n\nSince I'm now behind, I need to be more strategic. The values show Brick (30) and Ore (34) are most valuable, while Wheat (6) and Wood (9) are least valuable.\n\nMy next offer should try to maximize value for me while potentially appealing to Player 0. Given I have excess low-value items (Wheat and Wood), I should offer more of these to try getting high-value resources.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 4 Brick, 1 Ore]",
