      "response": "I am Player 0.\nMy current resources are:\n  - Wheat: 6 (Value: 6)\n  - Wood: 13 (Value: 8)\n  - Sheep: 14 (Value: 18)\n  - Brick: 24 (Value: 21)\n  - Ore: 23 (Value: 38)\n\nMy total value is 6 + 8 + 18 + 21 + 38 = 91.\n\nI want to increase my total value. To do this, I will try to trade away resources I have in abundance or those that are less valuable to me, for resources that are more valuable or that I have less of.\n\nBased on the current values:\n- Ore is the most valuable (38).\n- Sheep is the least valuable (18).\n\nI have a lot of Sheep (14), Brick (24), and Ore (23). I have less Wheat (6) and Wood (13).\n\nMy goal is to increase my overall value, meaning I want to get more value out of what I receive than what I give away.\n\nLet's try to trade some Sheep and Brick, which I have more of, for something I need more or has higher value, like Wheat or Wood, or even more Ore if I can get a good deal.\n\nConsidering the values:\n- 1 Sheep = 18\n- 1 Brick = 21\n- 1 Ore = 38\n- 1 Wood = 8\n- 1 Wheat = 6\n\nIt's probably best to trade resources *I* value less (Sheep, Brick) for resources *I* value more (Ore, or even something I have less of like Wheat/Wood if the trade is favorable). However, since my goal is to increase total value, I want `value_of_received > value_of_offered`.\n\nLet's try to trade some of my higher quantity, lower-ish value resources for higher value or scarcer ones.\n\nI have 14 Sheep and 24 Brick. I have plenty of Ore (23), but it's valuable.\n\nLet's try to trade 2 Sheep and 1 Brick for 1 Ore.\nValue offered: (2 * 18) + (1 * 21) = 36 + 21 = 57\nValue requested: 1 * 38 = 38\nThis is a bad trade for me. I am giving up more value than I am getting.\n\nI need to be careful with the listed values. These values are *my* current evaluation. The opponent might have different evaluations or needs.\nI want to get higher value items for lower value items.\n\nLet's offer a common resource for a more valuable one, ensuring I gain value.\n\nHow about trading a lot of sheep for some ore?\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 2 * 18 = 36\nValue requested: 1 * 38 = 38\nThis looks like a small gain in value (38-36 = 2). It's a start.\n\nLet's try to trade more efficiently for Ore.\nMy current total value is 91.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore] is giving too much.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 3 * 18 = 54\nValue requested: 1 * 38 = 38\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nThe values listed (Wheat: 6, Wood: 8, Sheep: 18, Brick: 21, Ore: 38) are my *current* values. I should try to make trades where the sum of values I receive is greater than the sum of values I offer.\n\nLet's try to offload some Sheep or Brick for Ore.\nI have a significant amount of Sheep and Brick.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep and 1 Brick for something more valuable?\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 18 + 21 = 39\nValue requested: 38\nThis is a small loss for me.\n\nI need to trade things I have a lot of or value less, for things I value more. My goal is to increase the *total value*.\n\nLet's assume the opponent also values Ore highly.\n\nI'll try a simple trade where I aim for a clear value increase.\nConsidering the high quantity of Brick (24) and Ore (23), and the relatively lower value of Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get more Wheat or Wood, which I have less of.\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood]\nValue offered: 18\nValue requested: 2 * 8 = 16\nThis is a loss.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wood]\nValue offered: 21\nValue requested: 3 * 8 = 24\nThis is a gain! (24-21 = 3). I will propose this trade. I have many bricks, and fewer woods.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wood]",
