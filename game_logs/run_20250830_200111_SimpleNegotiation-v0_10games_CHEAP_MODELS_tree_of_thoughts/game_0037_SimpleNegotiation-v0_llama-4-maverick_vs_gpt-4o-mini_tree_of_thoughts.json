Acquiring more Ore would significantly increase the total value.\n   - Brick (Value: 22) and Sheep (Value: 14) are also valuable.\n\n### Initial Offer\n\nTo start, I'll look to trade away some of my less valuable resources for something more valuable. Since Ore is the most valuable, let's see if I can get more Ore.\n\nLet's offer 5 Wood (Value: 11) and 2 Wheat (Value: 5) for 1 Ore (Value: 40). The total value offered is (5*11) + (2*5) = 55 + 10 = 65, and the value requested is 1*40 = 40. Although it seems like we're giving more value than we're getting, it's a starting point for negotiation.\n\nMy offer: `[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis is the first turn, and I'm making an initial offer to start the negotiation.

      "response": "### Step 1: Analyze the Current State of Resources\n\nAfter the last turn, we need to assess the current state of our resources.\n\nInitially, we had:\n- Wheat: 14 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 24 (Value: 11)\n- Sheep: 9 (Value: 14)\n- Brick: 10 (Value: 22)\n- Ore: 8 (Value: 40)\n\nChanges due to trades:\n1. Offered: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> Requested: 1 Ore\n   - Wheat: 14 - 1 = 13\n   - Sheep: 9 - 2 = 7\n   - Ore: 8 + 1 = 9\n\n2. Offered: 4 Wood -> Requested: 2 Brick\n   - Wood: 24 - 4 = 20\n   - Brick: 10 + 2 = 12\n\n3. Offered: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> Requested: 1 Ore\n   - Sheep: 7 - 2 = 5\n   - Brick: 12 - 1 = 11\n   - Ore: 9 + 1 = 10\n\nCurrent state:\n- Wheat: 13\n- Wood: 20\n- Sheep: 5\n- Brick: 11\n- Ore: 10\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Current Total Value\n\nLet's calculate the total value of the resources we currently have:\n- Wheat: 13 * 5 = 65\n- Wood: 20 * 11 = 220\n- Sheep: 5 * 14 = 70\n- Brick: 11 * 22 = 242\n- Ore: 10 * 40 = 400\n\nTotal Value = 65 + 220 + 70 + 242 + 400 = 997\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Next Action\n\nTo decide the next action, let's consider what we can offer or request to potentially increase our total value.\n\n1. **Identify surplus and deficit resources**: We have a good amount of Ore and Brick. Our goal is to see if we can trade something less valuable for something more valuable or at least maintain our current value.\n\n2. **Potential trades**:\n   - We could offer some Wood (Value: 11) to get more valuable resources if possible.\n   - We could also consider offering some Sheep or Wheat for more valuable resources.\n\nGiven that we have successfully acquired Ore in previous trades, and we have a substantial amount of Wood, let's consider trading some Wood for an even more valuable resource or maintaining our current valuable resources.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate a Trade Offer\n\nLet's formulate a trade offer. We can offer some of our Wood for Brick or Ore since both are valuable. However, we already have a considerable amount of Ore, so let's focus on maintaining or slightly increasing our valuable resources.\n\nAn example trade could be offering 3 Wood for 1 Brick (since Brick is quite valuable):\n- Offered: 3 Wood -> Requested: 1 Brick\n\nCalculation:\n- We have 20 Wood, so offering 3 Wood leaves us with 20 - 3 = 17 Wood.\n- We have 11 Brick, so getting 1 Brick makes it 11 + 1 = 12 Brick.\n\nLet's check the value:\n- Before: 20 Wood * 11 + 11 Brick * 22 = 220 + 242 = 462\n- After: 17 Wood * 11 + 12 Brick * 22 = 187 + 264 = 451\n\nThis trade actually decreases our total value related to these resources, so it's not beneficial.\n\nLet's directly formulate the output as the required format demands a specific action.\n\n### Output\n\nGiven the current situation and analyzing potential trades, a more beneficial trade needs to be identified.\n\nLet's directly propose a trade that could be beneficial based on our resources and the goal to increase total value.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Brick] \n\nLet's evaluate this:\n- We have 20 Wood, so 20 - 5 = 15 Wood.\n- We have 11 Brick, so 11 + 1 = 12 Brick.\n\nValue change:\n- Wood: 20 * 11 = 220 -> 15 * 11 = 165 (Decrease by 55)\n- Brick: 11 * 22 = 242 -> 12 * 22 = 264 (Increase by 22)\n\nNet change = -55 + 22 = -33 (Not beneficial)\n\nRevisiting our resources and considering alternative trades:\n- Offering Sheep or Wheat for Ore could be beneficial given Ore's high value.\n\nLet's consider:\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nCalculation:\n- Sheep: 5 - 2 = 3\n- Wheat: 13 - 1 = 12\n- Ore: 10 + 1 = 11\n\nValue change:\n- Sheep: 5 * 14 = 70 -> 3 * 14 = 42 (Decrease by 28)\n- Wheat: 13 * 5 = 65 -> 12 * 5 = 60 (Decrease by 5)\n- Ore: 10 * 40 = 400 -> 11 * 40 = 440 (Increase by 40)\n\nNet change = -28 - 5 + 40 = +7 (Beneficial)\n\n### Final Action\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
