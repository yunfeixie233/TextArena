      "response": "Since your total value of resources is related to the quantity of items you have and their associated value, you should try to acquire items with a higher value while giving away items with a lower value.\n\nHere's a breakdown of your current inventory and the values:\n*   **Wheat:** Value 5\n*   **Wood:** Value 8\n*   **Sheep:** Value 12\n*   **Brick:** Value 25\n*   **Ore:** Value 39\n\nYour previous offer was \"10 Wheat -> 2 Ore\".\n*   Value of 10 Wheat = 10 * 5 = 50\n*   Value of 2 Ore = 2 * 39 = 78\nYou were offering something worth 50 to get something worth 78. This is a good target for you, but Player 1 rejected it. This might be because the offer was too good for you and not good enough for them.\n\nLet's reconsider. You have a lot of Wheat and Brick. Ore is your most valuable resource.\n\nGiven the rejection, you could try a slightly more balanced offer for Player 1, or try to get something else valuable. You want to increase your total value.\n\nConsider offering more Wheat or a combination of lower-value items for something valuable like Ore or Brick.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again, but perhaps offer a bit more or a different combination of items.\nYou have 18 Wheat (Value 5), 13 Wood (Value 8), 9 Sheep (Value 12), 18 Brick (Value 25), 20 Ore (Value 39).\n\nThink about what Player 1 might want. Maybe they need a lot of a specific resource. You don't know what Player 1 has.\n\nTo make your total value increase, the value of the items you receive must be greater than the value of the items you give up.\n\nSince your previous offer of 10 Wheat for 2 Ore (50 vs 78 value) was rejected, Player 1 might think it's too much in your favor.\n\nLet's try to offer a mix of lower-value items for a smaller amount of Ore, or a good amount of Brick.\n\nWhat if we try to get one Ore?\nValue of 1 Ore = 39.\nWhat can you offer that's less than 39 but still attractive?\n*   7 Wheat = 35\n*   4 Wood = 32\n*   3 Sheep = 36\n\nLet's try with Sheep, as you have 9 of them and their value is decent but still lower than Brick or Ore.\n\n**[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**\n*   Value of 3 Sheep = 3 * 12 = 36\n*   Value of 1 Ore = 1 * 39 = 39\nThis is a small gain for you and might be more palatable for Player 1.\n\nOr, if you want something with slightly less value, you could aim for Brick.\nValue of 1 Brick = 25.\nYou have a lot of Wheat and Wood.\n**[Offer: 2 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]**\n*   Value of 2 Wood = 2 * 8 = 16\n*   Value of 3 Wheat = 3 * 5 = 15\n*   Total Offered Value = 16 + 15 = 31\n*   Value of 1 Brick = 25\nThis would be a loss for you value-wise (+25 - +31 = -6 value). You want a gain!\n\nLet's stick to the strategy of giving away lower-value items for higher-value ones.\n\nLet's try to offer a better deal for Player 1, something they might actually accept, but still\na positive gain for you.\n\nHow about offering a significant amount of Wheat for some Brick? You have 18 Wheat.\n**[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Brick]**\n*   Value of 8 Wheat = 8 * 5 = 40\n*   Value of 2 Brick = 2 * 25 = 50\nThis is a gain of 10 value for you. This might be a more attractive offer for Player 1, especially if they need Wheat.\n\nLet's go with this. It's a clear gain for you and a large quantity of a low-value item (Wheat) for a good quantity of a medium-high value item (Brick).\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",
