      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to make strategic trades. Let's analyze the resources I have and their values:\n\n1. Wheat (Qty: 25, Value: 5)\n2. Wood (Qty: 5, Value: 12)\n3. Sheep (Qty: 20, Value: 18)\n4. Brick (Qty: 10, Value: 30)\n5. Ore (Qty: 18, Value: 40)\n\nFirst, I'll identify the resources with the highest and lowest values. Ore has the highest value (40), followed by Brick (30), Sheep (18), Wood (12), and Wheat (5) has the lowest.\n\nTo increase the total value, I should aim to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values or maintain the quantity of high-value resources while getting rid of lower-value ones.\n\nLet's start by examining potential trades:\n\n1. I have a significant quantity of Wheat, which is the lowest value resource. Trading it for something of higher value could be beneficial.\n2. Ore is my most valuable resource, and I should be cautious about trading it away. However, I can consider trading some of it if I get a very favorable deal.\n\nFor the first turn, I'll make an offer that involves trading some of my lower-value resources for something more valuable. Since Brick is relatively valuable and I have a moderate quantity of it, I'll try to increase my Ore or keep my high-value resources while getting rid of lower-value ones.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some Wheat and/or Wood for either Brick or Ore, but since I already have Brick and a good amount of it, I'll focus on potentially getting more Ore or maintaining my current high-value resources.\n\nHere's a potential offer:\n\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]`\n\nThis trade involves giving away 10 Wheat (Value: 50) and 2 Wood (Value: 24) for 2 Ore (Value: 80). The total value given away is 74, and the total value received is 80, making it a slightly positive trade in terms of value.\n\nLet's send the offer:\n\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]`",

This increased the total value from 1575 (initial total value) to 1571 (after the trade), since we gave away (10*5 + 2*12) = 50 + 24 = 74 and got (2*40) = 80, resulting in a net gain of 6.\n\nThe second offer (5 Sheep -> 2 Brick) was rejected.

Offering 2 Wood for 1 Brick: \n  - Giving away: 2 Wood = 2 * 12 = 24\n  - Receiving: 1 Brick = 1 * 30 = 30\n\nThis is a potentially good trade as it results in a net gain (30 - 24 = 6).\n\n## Step 10: Make the trade offer.\nLet's offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick\n\nThe action in the required format is: [Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]}$",

      "response": "### Current State of Resources\n\nAfter the last trade:\n\n- **Wheat**: 25 - 10 = 15\n- **Wood**: 5 - 2 = 3\n- **Sheep**: 20 - 5 - 4 + 3 = 14\n- **Brick**: 10 + 2 + 1 = 13\n- **Ore**: 18 + 2 - 1 = 19\n\n### Current Quantities and Values\n\n+ [Wheat]   Qty: 15   Value: 5\n+ [Wood]    Qty: 3    Value: 12\n+ [Sheep]   Qty: 14   Value: 18\n+ [Brick]   Qty: 13   Value: 30\n+ [Ore]     Qty: 19   Value: 40\n\n### Total Value Calculation\n\nInitial total value = (25*5) + (5*12) + (20*18) + (10*30) + (18*40) = 125 + 60 + 360 + 300 + 720 = 1565\n\nCurrent total value = (15*5) + (3*12) + (14*18) + (13*30) + (19*40) = 75 + 36 + 252 + 390 + 760 = 1513\n\n### Next Action\n\nTo increase the total value, we need to strategically make the next offer. \n\n#### Analysis\n\n1. **Assess Current Resources**: We have a good quantity of Ore and Brick now. Ore has a high value, and Brick is also valuable.\n   \n2. **Identify Potential Trades**: We should look to trade resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable or at least equal in value but potentially more useful or needed by the opponent.\n\n3. **Consider Player 1's Last Actions**: Player 1 accepted trades that gave them Ore and Brick, indicating they might need or value these resources. They rejected trades that involved giving more Ore or Brick, suggesting they are trying to accumulate these.\n\n4. **Formulate a Trade**:\n\n- We have a relatively low quantity of Wood, but it's not extremely valuable. \n- Sheep are moderately valuable.\n- We could consider offering some Wheat (least valuable) or Sheep for more valuable resources.\n\n#### Proposed Trade\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- Offering Wheat for more valuable resources could be a good start since Wheat is the least valuable resource.\n\nLet's consider: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\n- We have 15 Wheat, so giving 5 is not too costly.\n- Brick is valuable, and we already have a decent amount, but having more could be beneficial if we can get something even more valuable in return later.\n\nHowever, since Player 1 is interested in Brick and we already have a good amount of it, let's think of something that could benefit both.\n\nLet's directly propose a trade that involves our less valuable resources and see if we can get something more valuable.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis trade involves giving away resources of total value (5*5 + 2*18) = 25 + 36 = 61 for 1 Ore worth 40. It's not a great deal value-wise, but let's adjust our strategy to be more beneficial.\n\nLet's think... \n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\n- Giving away 3 Wheat (value = 15) for 1 Brick (value = 30) is a good deal.\n\nLet's do this.\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`",
