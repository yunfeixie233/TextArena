Player 1 might value Wood more than I do.\n\nLet's try to get Brick or Ore for my Wood. Since the last offer was rejected, I should adjust.\nThe previous offer was 2 Wood (value 22) for 1 Ore (value 38), which was a good deal for me. Player 1 probably saw it as unbalanced.\n\nMaybe I can offer more Wood for 1 Ore or 1 Brick.\n2 Wood for 1 Ore is 22 vs 38.\nIf I offer 3 Wood, that's 33 value. For 1 Ore (38 value). Might still be rejected as it's still a good deal for me.\nWhat if I offer 2 Wood for 1 Brick? That's 22 value for 22 value. That's a fair offer. I have plenty of Wood and few Brick. This would be a good trade for me, despite the even value, as I'd be converting a resource I have a lot of into a more consolidated, valuable resource.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to get rid of some Wheat, the least valuable resource per unit. But I only have 9.\n\nLet's try a fairer offer with Wood for Brick, since the values are equal. This might entice Player 1 to accept.\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
