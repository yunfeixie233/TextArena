Since we have a good quantity of all resources but the values vary, we should focus on trading resources with lower values for those with higher values if possible.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. We have a lot of Wheat (low value) and could try to trade it for something higher in value.\n2. We could also consider trading some of our Wood (value: 9) for higher value resources.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some Wheat and/or Wood for Brick or Ore since they have higher values.\n\nLet's make an offer:\n- We can offer 5 Wheat and 2 Wood (total value = 5*5 + 2*9 = 25 + 18 = 43) for 1 Brick (value = 25). This isn't beneficial since we're giving up more value than we're getting.\n- A more beneficial trade would be to offer resources for Ore or try to negotiate for a resource that is relatively higher in value.\n\nLet's think about offering some of our resources for Ore or Brick since they are of higher value.\n\nConsidering the available resources and the goal to increase total value, one potential trade could be:\n- Offering 4 Wood (value: 36) for 1 Ore (value: 40). This seems like a potentially beneficial trade since we're gaining 4 units of value.\n\nSo, a potential offer could be: `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThus, the action for this turn is: `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]`",
