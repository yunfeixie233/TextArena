      "response": "### Initial Analysis of Resources\n\nTo maximize the total value of resources, we first need to understand the current distribution and value of the resources we hold.\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 12, Value: 6 per unit. Total Value: 72\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 7, Value: 8 per unit. Total Value: 56\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 5, Value: 18 per unit. Total Value: 90\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 12, Value: 22 per unit. Total Value: 264\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 18, Value: 35 per unit. Total Value: 630\n\nTotal initial value = 72 + 56 + 90 + 264 + 630 = 1112\n\n### Strategy for Turn 1\n\nTo make a beneficial trade, we need to identify which resources we can offer that are likely to be of less value to us compared to what we might receive. \n\n1. **Identify Resources to Offer**: We should consider offering resources with lower values or those that we have in abundance relative to their value. Wheat (Value: 6) is the lowest value resource we have, and we have a significant quantity of it.\n\n2. **Identify Resources to Request**: We should look to acquire resources with higher values or those that we are relatively lacking in, especially if they are crucial for future trades or have a high value.\n\n### Trade Offer for Turn 1\n\nLet's propose a trade that involves offering some of our lower-value resources for something potentially more valuable or useful.\n\nWe have a lot of Wheat and Ore. Let's consider offering some Wheat and potentially another resource for something of higher value.\n\n**Offer**: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Sheep]`\n\n- We are offering 5 Wheat (Value: 6 * 5 = 30) and 2 Wood (Value: 8 * 2 = 16), totaling a value of 46.\n- We are requesting 3 Sheep (Value: 18 * 3 = 54), which is of higher value than what we're offering.\n\nThis trade increases our total value since we're gaining 54 value for resources worth 46.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Sheep]`\n\nLet's see the response from the opponent and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next turn.",

I used some Wheat and Wood in my previous offer, so I have less of those now.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some of my lower-value resources or a quantity of a higher-value resource for something that might increase my total value. \n\nFor instance, I could try to trade some Ore for a resource that I value highly or is scarce for me. However, since I already have a lot of Ore, it might not be the best to give away more. Another option is to see if I can get more of a high-value resource.\n\nConsidering my resources and the goal to increase total value, I will make a new offer.
