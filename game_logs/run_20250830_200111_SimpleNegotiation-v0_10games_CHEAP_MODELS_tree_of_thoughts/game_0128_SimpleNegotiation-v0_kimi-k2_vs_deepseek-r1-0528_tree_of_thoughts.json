I already accepted one of these, I can reasonably expect they have an excess of Sheep and want more Brick.\n\nFor the upcoming Turn 8 (since you've already listed events through what looks like Turn 7), I would like:\n\n1. More Wood (currently my second scarcest after Wheat).  \n2. To reduce excess Sheep (mine are now only 11, but they remain above the Wood supply which I value highly).\n\nA trade I believe Player 1 may consider is one that gives them 4 Brick\u2014the resource they keep asking for\u2014but takes from them Wood (which I want) at a favorable ratio based on our earlier exchanges.\n\n[Offer: 8 Brick -> 10 Wood]",
