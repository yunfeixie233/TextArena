      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, let's analyze the current state of resources and their values:\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 19, Value: 5\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 6, Value: 9\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 10, Value: 13\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 20, Value: 27\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 18, Value: 34\n\nTo increase the total value of resources, we need to consider trades that give us resources of higher value or more quantity of resources that are relatively undervalued compared to others.\n\n### Trade Strategy\n\n1. **Identify Undervalued and Overvalued Resources**: \n   - The resources with lower values are Wheat (5) and Wood (9).\n   - The resources with higher values are Sheep (13), Brick (27), and Ore (34).\n\n2. **Potential Trades**:\n   - We can consider offering Wheat or Wood for other resources because they are of lower value.\n   - Ideally, we'd want to get Sheep, Brick, or Ore in return.\n\n### Initial Offer\n\nLet's make an initial offer that involves trading some of our lower-value resources for higher-value ones. Since Wheat is the lowest in value and we have a substantial quantity, we can start by offering Wheat.\n\nLet's propose: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nThis translates to offering 5 Wheat (total value = 5 * 5 = 25) for 1 Sheep (value = 13). While it seems like we're losing value (since 25 > 13), it's essential to negotiate and potentially get more in subsequent trades. However, we should adjust our strategy to be more value-neutral or positive.\n\nUpon reevaluation, a more balanced initial offer could be: `[Offer: 3 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nHere, we're offering 3 Wood (3*9 = 27) and 4 Wheat (4*5 = 20), totaling 47 in value, for 1 Brick (27). This is still not ideal due to the negative value difference.\n\nLet's refine our strategy further.\n\n### Refined Initial Offer\n\nConsidering the values, a more reasonable trade would be: `[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood]`\n\nThis isn't significantly beneficial in terms of total value (2*5 = 10 for 1*9 = 9), but it's a small step.\n\nHowever, let's directly aim for something more beneficial. \n\nLet's directly make a more sensible offer: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nHere, we're giving up 4 Wheat (4*5 = 20) for 1 Ore (1*34 = 34), which is a positive gain.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat, 0 Other -> 1 Ore, 0 Other]`\n\nHowever, to adhere to the format, let's simplify it to: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's execute this action.\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`",

Giving away 2 Ore and 1 Brick means giving away 2 * 34 + 1 * 27 = 95. In return, we get 6 Wheat and 1 Sheep, which is worth 6 * 5 + 1 * 13 = 43. So, it's not a good deal.\n\nSince we have only 1 Wheat left, let's try to get more Wheat or other valuable resources. We can offer some of our abundant resources like Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's make a new offer: [Offer: 2 Brick -> 5 Wheat]\n\nThis is my response: [Offer: 2 Brick -> 5 Wheat]",
