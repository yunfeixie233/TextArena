I had previously offered 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, which was rejected. I could try adjusting this offer.\n\n## Step 10: Adjust the previous trade offer\nLet's increase the quantity of Wheat offered to make it more attractive. So, offering 6 Wheat for 1 Ore could be a new offer. The value of 6 Wheat is 6*5 = 30, and 1 Ore is 34. The net gain is 4, which is positive.\n\n## Step 11: Make the new trade offer\nMy new offer is: [Offer:6 Wheat ->1 Ore].\n\n## Step 12: Finalize the actions for this turn\nFirst, I accept the last offer from Player0: [Accept].
