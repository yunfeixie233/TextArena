      "response": "It\u2019s currently my turn (turn unspecified, but we\u2019ve already used five \u201ctrading events\u201d worth of history).  \n**Current inventory after accepted exchanges**  \n- Wheat: 10 \u00d7 6 = 60  \n- Wood: 20 \u00d7 10 = 200   (gave away 5 for 1 Ore last turn)  \n- Sheep: 10 \u00d7 13 = 130  (gained 5 Sheep earlier for 2 Ore)  \n- Brick: 15 \u00d7 25 = 375  \n- Ore :   9 \u00d7 32 = 288   (gave 2 away earlier, but gained 1 back)\n\n**Total value = 60+200+130+375+288 = 1,053**\n\nPlayer 1 keeps offering 1 Ore \u2192 2 Brick. Since each Brick is worth 25, giving away 2 \u00d7 25 = 50 to receive 1 \u00d7 32 = 32 would lose me 18 value; that\u2019s a definite \u2018no\u2019.\n\nI want to make a *profitable* counter-offer. Of the resources I have room to give, Wood is least desirable (value 10) and Ore is most (value 32). Brick is also valuable (25). Swapping my surplus Wood for more Brick or Ore is the clearest win.\n\n**[Offer: 5 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 2 Brick]**  \n\n- I give: 5 Wood (50) + 1 Sheep (13) = 63 value  \n- I get: 1 Ore (32) + 2 Brick (50) = 82 value  \n\nNet gain: +19.
