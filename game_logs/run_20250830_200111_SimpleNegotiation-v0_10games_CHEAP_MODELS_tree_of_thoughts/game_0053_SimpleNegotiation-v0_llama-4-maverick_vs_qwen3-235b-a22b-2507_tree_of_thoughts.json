      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, let's analyze the current state of resources and their values:\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Quantity = 10, Value = 5\n- **[Wood]**: Quantity = 9, Value = 8\n- **[Sheep]**: Quantity = 25, Value = 12\n- **[Brick]**: Quantity = 22, Value = 21\n- **[Ore]**: Quantity = 19, Value = 38\n\nThe total value of resources = (10*5) + (9*8) + (25*12) + (22*21) + (19*38) = 50 + 72 + 300 + 462 + 722 = 1606.\n\n### Negotiation Strategy\n\nTo maximize the total value of resources, we need to identify potentially beneficial trades. The resources with the highest value per unit are **[Ore]** (Value = 38) and **[Brick]** (Value = 21). \n\n1. **Identify Potential Trades**: We should look to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values if possible. \n\n2. **Formulate an Offer**: Since **[Ore]** is the most valuable resource, we should be cautious about trading it away. However, if we can get a good deal, we might consider it. \n\n   Let's examine a potential trade involving **[Sheep]** (Value = 12) or **[Wood]** (Value = 8) for **[Ore]** or more **[Brick]**.\n\n3. **Example Trade**: \n   - We could offer some **[Sheep]** or **[Wood]** for **[Ore]** or **[Brick]**.\n\nLet's propose an initial offer:\n- **[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**: This trade involves giving away 5 Sheep (total value = 5*12 = 60) for 1 Ore (value = 38). This is not a good trade for us as we're losing value.\n\nLet's consider a more balanced trade:\n- **[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]**: Here, we're offering 2 Wood (2*8 = 16) and 1 Sheep (1*12 = 12), totaling 28, for 1 Brick (value = 21). This is still not beneficial.\n\nLet's directly aim for a trade that involves getting more valuable resources or maintaining the value while potentially setting up for future beneficial trades.\n\n### Initial Offer\n\nLet's directly make an offer that could potentially benefit us or at least is not immediately rejected:\n- **[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick]**: We're offering 3 Wheat (3*5 = 15) and 2 Wood (2*8 = 16), totaling 31, for 2 Brick (2*21 = 42). This trade increases our total value.\n\nThe response will depend on the opponent's reaction to this offer.\n\n### Action\n\n**[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick]**",

Since we have a surplus of Sheep, we might consider offering some Sheep.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some Sheep (since we have a lot) and possibly some other less valuable resources to get either Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's think about a specific trade offer:\n- We could offer some Sheep and possibly Wheat (since it's less valuable) to get Brick or Ore.\n\nFor example, a potential offer could be: '[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Brick]' or '[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nLet's calculate the value of these potential trades:\n1. '[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Brick]': We give up 5*12 = 60 value and get 1*21 = 21 value. This is not beneficial.\n2. '[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore]': We give up 5*12 = 60 value and get 1*38 = 38 value. This is also not beneficial.\n\nLet's consider a more nuanced offer:\n- To get 1 Ore (value 38), we could offer something of similar or slightly less value. We have Sheep (value 12 each), so offering 3 Sheep (total value 36) might be a reasonable trade to request 1 Ore.\n\nThus, a potential offer is: '[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThe response to this offer will be from Player 1, and we will need to react accordingly with either '[Accept]' if they accept our counter-offer or make a new offer if they counter-offer or deny.\n\nGiven the situation, let's make the offer: '[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThe action for this turn is: [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore].",

      "response": "Since I've already accepted a trade offer from Player 1 in the previous turn, let's analyze my current resources and the history of trades.\n\nInitially, I had:\n- Wheat: 10 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 9 (Value: 8)\n- Sheep: 25 (Value: 12)\n- Brick: 22 (Value: 21)\n- Ore: 19 (Value: 38)\n\nAfter the trade with Player 1 where I offered 3 Wood for 4 Sheep and 1 Wheat:\n- I gave away 3 Wood, so I have 9 - 3 = 6 Wood left.\n- I received 4 Sheep and 1 Wheat, so I now have 25 + 4 = 29 Sheep and 10 + 1 = 11 Wheat.\n\nCurrent resources:\n- Wheat: 11 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 6 (Value: 8)\n- Sheep: 29 (Value: 12)\n- Brick: 22 (Value: 21)\n- Ore: 19 (Value: 38)\n\nLet's evaluate the last offer I made and was rejected: Offered items: 5 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Brick. It seems like Player 1 is not interested in this deal.\n\nTo maximize my resources, I need to think about what I can offer that might be valuable to Player 1, and what I can request in return that would be valuable to me.\n\nGiven my current resources and the values associated with them, I should aim to get resources with higher values. My next step should be to analyze the difference in values and try to make a deal that benefits me.\n\nOne possible trade could involve offering some of my Sheep (Value: 12) for Brick (Value: 21) or Ore (Value: 38), as these have higher values.\n\nLet's make an offer: [Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe action: [Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
