      "response": "After reviewing our successful trade history, the pattern of exchanging 2 Wheat, 2 Wood, and 2 Sheep for 2 Brick and 1 Ore has consistently increased my total resource value by 13 per trade (64 value given vs. 77 value received). I still have sufficient resources to propose this again and aim to maximize gains before the game concludes. Player 1 has accepted this exact offer three times consecutively, indicating a high likelihood of acceptance.  \n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]",
