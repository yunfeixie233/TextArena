Let me analyze the board:\n\nPlayer 1 placed X in cell 8. If they get another X in cells 5 and 2, they'd have a diagonal win. I should block this by taking cell 2 to prevent their diagonal threat.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] [6]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] Time to take the win: middle-column (1-4-7) is one move from a triple.  \nGoing for the kill at 7.\n\n[7]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | O | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[3]', '[5]'\n[Player 1] [5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[3]'\n[Player 0] My column\u2010win is already sealed, so the game is over.
