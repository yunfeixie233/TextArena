The opponent's opening at cell 0 (X) was blocked by forcing a response to limit their control. Since I hold the center (O at 4), capturing a corner strengthens positional dominance. Cell 8 is strategically optimal:\n\n1. It occupies the diagonal opposite X at 0, disrupting their control.\n2. If the opponent replies at 2 (top-right), a follow-up block at 1 will neutralize threats, preserving balance. \n3.
