After analysis, the optimal move is **cell 8** to secure a corner position, maintain flexibility, and force a draw with optimal play. Here's my reasoning:\n\n- **Why cell 8?**\n  - Occupying the corner (cell 8) is strategically superior to edges in Tic Tac Toe, creating multiple potential winning lines.\n  - It forces Player 0 to block immediate threats in the diagonal (cells 4-8) or bottom row (cells 6-8), restricting their options.\n  - All other moves lead to high-risk scenarios where Player 0 can force a win. For example: \n    - Cell 2 or 6 allows a fork (Player 0 winning via column/row) if not perfectly countered.\n    - Cell 3 (edge) permits Player 0 to exploit weaknesses in the left column or bottom row. \n\n- **Positional Impact:**\n  - After my move, Player 0 must block or respond defensively, allowing me to secure a draw even with optimal counterplay. \n\n**Attack command:** [8]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | X | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | O \n---+---+---\n 6 | O | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[6]'\n[Player 0]  In response to your strategic placement at cell 8, I recognize a need for immediate action.
