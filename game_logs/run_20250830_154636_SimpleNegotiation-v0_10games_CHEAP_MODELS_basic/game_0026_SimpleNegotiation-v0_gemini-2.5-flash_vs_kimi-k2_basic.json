They seem to be *scarce* for P0, since they never offered either.  \n- Wood \u2013 we have 19, cheapest in value, thus probably our most trade-able *low-value filler*.\n\nNet objective  \nWe want to increase total value while consuming the *cheapest* resources first.

We will give them only **1 Sheep**, but sweeten with 6 Wood (value 8*6 = 48). In exchange we\u2019ll ask 4 Brick (120) + 1 Ore (36). Net value gain: 120+36 = +156 vs 16+48 = \u201364 \u21d2 **total gain \u2248 +92**.
