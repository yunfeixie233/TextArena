My strategy is to trade away resources that I have in abundance and that have a lower relative value, for resources that have a higher relative value or that I need.\n\nMy previous offer of 2 Wheat for 1 Ore was rejected. The value of 2 Wheat is 12, and the value of 1 Ore is 40. This was a very favorable trade for me, so it's not surprising it was rejected.\n\nMy goal is to increase my overall resource value. Let's look at the value per unit for each resource:\n*   [Wheat]: 6/unit\n*   [Wood]: 12/unit\n*   [Sheep]: 12/unit\n*   [Brick]: 22/unit\n*   [Ore]: 40/unit\n\nOre and Brick have the highest value per unit. Wheat has the lowest. I have a lot of Ore (24 units) and Wood (10 units) and Sheep (14 units). I also have a fair amount of Brick (13 units). Wheat is the resource I have least of (7 units).\n\nIt might be good to get rid of some Wood or Sheep, as their value is relatively low. I also have a lot of Ore, but it's very valuable. I could trade some Ore for Brick, as Brick is also valuable and I have less of it.\n\nPlayer 1 rejected my previous offer. Player 1 also didn't make a counter offer, which means they might be waiting for me to make a more reasonable one, or they simply aren't interested in trading Ore for Wheat at that rate.\n\nI will try to make a more balanced offer, offering something with a higher value than Wheat, for a resource that I value.\nLet's try to trade Wood for Brick. Wood is 12 per unit, Brick is 22 per unit.\nIf I offer 2 Wood (value 24) for 1 Brick (value 22), it's slightly in my favor and more balanced than the previous offer.\nAlternatively, I could try to get more Ore, but I already have a lot.\n\nWhat about trading some of my cheaper resources for a quantity of a more expensive resource, even if it's slightly less favorable per unit, if it increases my overall value?\n\nLet's consider trading Wood, as I have 10 units. I want to acquire Brick or Ore.\n\nHow about I offer something with a higher total value this time from my side, to entice Player 1?\nI have a lot of Ore. While it's valuable, maybe I can trade a small amount of it for something else that also has good value, like Brick, especially if I can get more units.\nFor example, 1 Ore (40 value) for 2 Brick (44 value) or 3 Brick (66 value). The latter is very good for me. 2 Brick for 1 Ore is slightly favorable for Player 1.\nWhat if I offer a combination?\n\nLet me try to get some more Brick, as it's the second most valuable resource and I have less of it than Ore.\nOffer: 1 Wood (Value 12) + 1 Sheep (Value 12) = Total 24.\nRequested: 1 Brick (Value 22).\nThis is slightly in Player 1's favor, which might make it more appealing and accepted. I am giving up two low-value items for one higher-value item. This reduces the number of lower-value items I hold and consolidates into a higher-value item.\n\n[Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",
