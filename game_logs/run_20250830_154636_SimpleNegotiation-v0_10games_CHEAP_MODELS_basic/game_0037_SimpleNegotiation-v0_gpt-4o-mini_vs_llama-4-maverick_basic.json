Let's think about offering something else in exchange for Brick.\n\n'[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 6 Brick]' could be a potential counteroffer because:\n- We give away: 3 Wood (Value: 8 * 3 = 24) and 1 Sheep (Value: 18 * 1 = 18), totaling 24 + 18 = 42 in value.\n- We receive: 6 Brick (Value: 20 * 6 = 120).\n\nThis results in a gain of 120 - 42 = 78 in total value.\n\nLet's make this counteroffer.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 6 Brick]",
