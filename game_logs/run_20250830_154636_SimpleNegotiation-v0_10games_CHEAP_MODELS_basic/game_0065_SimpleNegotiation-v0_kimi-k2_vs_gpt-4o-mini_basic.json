However, the second trade was quite lucrative:\n\n- Traded 6 Wheat (36 value) and 4 Brick (84 value) for 3 Wood (36 value), 3 Sheep (54 value), and 2 Ore (70 value).\n\n51 value traded for 160 value received: got 109 value for just 120, which was beneficial.\n\n**Goal:** I should focus on further improving my value by targeting resources with high value per unit (Ore). I now have moderate amounts of Wood and lower amounts of Sheep and Wheat. I possess substantial Brick (16) and some Ore (9). Given that Ore is my highest-value resource (per unit), I should aim to acquire more of it when possible.\n\n**Strategy:**\nSince Sheep and Wood have decent value and I have extra Wheat and Brick, I might aim to exchange surplus Brick and Wheat for more Ore or Sheep to maximize my value.\n\n**Next Offer Idea:**\n- I could offer some Brick and Wheat in exchange for Ore and perhaps more desirable resources.\n\n**Offer Plan:**\n- Offer 6 Brick (126 value) + 3 Wheat (18 value) for 3 Ore (105 value) and 3 Sheep (54 value).\n\nThis would:\n- Deduct 144 value of offered resources.\n- Gain 159 value (positive delta of 15).\n- Increase Ore count (my highest per-unit value resource).\n- Maintain Sheep count (good value resource).\n\nSo, the trade is value-positive and aligns with long-term strategy.\n\n[Offer: 6 Brick, 3 Wheat -> 3 Ore, 3 Sheep]",
