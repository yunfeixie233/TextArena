To do so, we should look to trade resources of lower value for resources of higher value or maintain quantities of high-value resources while getting more.\n\n### Observations:\n1. Ore is the highest value resource I have.\n2. Brick is the second-highest value resource per unit but is the scarcest.\n3. Sheep and Wood have moderate values.\n\n### First Turn:\nFor the first turn, I'll consider what I can offer that might be attractive to my opponent while benefiting me. Since Ore is my most valuable resource, I should be cautious about trading it away. However, I can consider trading some of my less valuable resources for more Brick or maintaining my Ore.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n- Trading Wheat (low value) for Brick or Ore (higher values) could be beneficial.\n- Trading Sheep or Wood for Brick could also be beneficial given that Brick has a higher value than both.\n\n### Proposed Trade for Turn 1:\nI'll offer to trade some Wheat for Brick because Wheat is relatively low in value, and Brick is higher. Let's say:\n- '[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 4 Brick]'\n\nThis trade involves giving away 8 Wheat (Value: 8*6 = 48) for 4 Brick (Value: 4*21 = 84).

Player 0 offered 8 Wheat for 4 Brick, which was rejected by Player 1.\n2. Player 1 made no counteroffer.\n3. The same offer was made again by Player 0 and rejected by Player 1.\n\n#### Current Turn Analysis:\nGiven that the previous offers were rejected, we need to reassess and possibly change our strategy.\n\n1. **Resource Value Analysis**: We are trying to increase our total value. Currently, we have a surplus of Wheat and a relatively lower quantity of Brick, which is of higher value per unit.\n\n2. **Trade Strategy**: Since our previous offer was rejected, we should consider alternative trades that could be more appealing to Player 1, or we should be prepared to make a different offer.\n\n3. **Potential Trades**:\n   - We could offer resources of lower value to us in exchange for resources of higher value.\n   - One potential trade could involve offering some of our Wheat (low value per unit) or Sheep (moderate value) for more Brick (higher value per unit) or possibly Ore (highest value per unit).\n\n4. **New Offer Consideration**:\n   - Considering our resources and the goal to increase total value, let's think about offering some Wheat and/or Sheep for Brick or Ore.\n\n#### New Trade Offer:\nLet's make a new offer that could be more appealing:\n- Offer 10 Wheat and 2 Sheep for 2 Brick and 1 Ore.\n\nTo check if this is beneficial:\n- We are giving away: 10 Wheat * 6 + 2 Sheep * 14 = 60 + 28 = 88 value\n- We are gaining: 2 Brick * 21 + 1 Ore * 38 = 42 + 38 = 80 value\nThis trade is not beneficial as it reduces our total value. Let's reconsider.\n\n#### Alternative Offer:\nLet's directly aim to increase our value by focusing on high-value resources:\n- Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore\n\nLet's calculate:\n- Giving away: 8 Wheat * 6 = 48\n- Gaining: 1 Ore * 38 = 38\nThis is still not a good trade for us.\n\nLet's directly formulate a potentially beneficial trade.\n\n### Trade Offer:\n'[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Brick]'\n\nThis translates to giving away:\n- 6 Wheat * 6 = 36 value\nAnd gaining:\n- 2 Brick * 21 = 42 value\nThis is a slightly positive trade.\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\n### Action:\n'[Offer: 6 Wheat,  -> 2 Brick]' is revised to follow the exact format required for the action.\n\n'[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Brick]'",
