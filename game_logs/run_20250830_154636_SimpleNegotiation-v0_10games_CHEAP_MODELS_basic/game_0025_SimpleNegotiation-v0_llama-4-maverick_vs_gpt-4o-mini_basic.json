      "response": "### Initial Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, my goal is to increase the total value of my resources through trades with my opponent. Let's first analyze the resources and their values:\n\n- Wheat: Qty = 21, Value = 6\n- Wood: Qty = 10, Value = 10\n- Sheep: Qty = 7, Value = 16\n- Brick: Qty = 9, Value = 24\n- Ore: Qty = 25, Value = 37\n\nThe total value of my current resources is calculated as follows:\n- Total Value = (21 * 6) + (10 * 10) + (7 * 16) + (9 * 24) + (25 * 37)\n- Total Value = 126 + 100 + 112 + 216 + 925 = 1479\n\n### Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Based on the given values, Ore is the most valuable resource, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\n### Initial Trade Offer\n\nSince Ore is the most valuable resource and I have a substantial quantity of it, I should try not to trade it away. However, I can consider trading some of my less valuable resources to get more Ore or other high-value resources. \n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n\n1. Trading Wheat (Value = 6) for higher-value resources.\n2. Trading Wood (Value = 10) for higher-value resources.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering Wheat or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\n### First Move\n\nLet's offer some Wheat for Brick, as Brick is more valuable than Wheat and Wood.\n\n- '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\nThis is my first move. I am offering 5 Wheat (Value = 30) for 1 Brick (Value = 24). Although it seems like I'm losing value, the actual negotiation will determine if the opponent is willing to accept this or counter with a better offer.\n\nLet's send the offer: \n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'",

However, having more Brick could be strategic for future trades or game objectives not fully detailed.\n\nFor the next turn, I need to analyze what I have and what could be beneficial to trade. I have a significant amount of Ore, which is highly valued. I should consider if trading some of it could bring in resources that are either more valuable or more scarce for me.\n\n### New Trade Offer\n\nConsidering the resources I have and their values, a potential trade could involve offering some Wheat (since I have a considerable amount and its value isn't the lowest) or Ore (since I have a lot of it, but it's highly valued). However, giving away too much Ore might not be ideal due to its high value.\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat for a resource that might be more valuable or useful. I still have 16 Wheat.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nI will make a new offer: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nThis offer is made because Sheep is more valuable than Wheat, and gaining more Sheep could potentially increase my total value or be used for a future beneficial trade.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`",

      "response": "## Step 1: Review the current state of resources after the trades.\nAfter the trades, we need to update the resources: Initially, we had Wheat: 21, Wood: 10, Sheep: 7, Brick: 9, Ore: 25. After the first trade (5 Wheat -> 1 Brick), we have Wheat: 16, Brick: 10. After the second trade (4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep), we have Wheat: 12, Sheep: 8. After the third trade (3 Wood -> 1 Ore), we have Wood: 7, Ore: 26.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the current total value of the resources.\nLet's calculate the total value: Wheat (12) * 6 = 72, Wood (7) * 10 = 70, Sheep (8) * 16 = 128, Brick (10) * 24 = 240, Ore (26) * 37 = 962. Total value = 72 + 70 + 128 + 240 + 962 = 1472.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the next trade based on the current resources and their values.\nTo maximize the total value, we should consider trading resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable. The values per resource are: Wheat = 6, Wood = 10, Sheep = 16, Brick = 24, Ore = 37. We should look to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze potential trades.\nWe have a significant amount of Wheat and Ore. Wheat is the least valuable, so trading it could be beneficial if we get a more valuable resource. Ore is very valuable, but we should be cautious not to trade it away too cheaply.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a trade offer.\nConsidering the values, trading Wheat for other resources could be beneficial. We could offer Wheat for either Sheep, Brick, or Ore since they are more valuable. Let's consider offering Wheat for Sheep or Brick because Ore is very valuable and we already have a lot of it.\n\n## Step 6: Decide on a specific trade.\nLet's offer some Wheat for Brick since Brick is more valuable than Sheep and we have a decent amount of Wheat left. For example, offering 2 Wheat for 1 Brick.\n\n## Step 7: Check if the trade is beneficial.\nThe trade is 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick. Value gained = 1 * 24 = 24, Value lost = 2 * 6 = 12. Net gain = 24 - 12 = 12. This is a beneficial trade.\n\n## Step 8: Formulate the trade offer in the required format.\nThe trade offer is: [Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]}$",

Let's examine potential trades based on the current resources and their values.\n\n#### Potential Trades:\n1. **Trading Wheat for higher-value resources:**\n   - Wheat (Value: 6) is the lowest value resource. Trading it for higher-value resources could be beneficial.\n\n2. **Evaluate Current Resources:**\n   - We have Wheat (12), Wood (7), Sheep (8), Brick (10), and Ore (26).\n\n3. **Possible Trades:**\n   - Offer Wheat for Sheep/Brick/Ore: Since Wheat has the lowest value, consider trading it for resources with higher values.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate a New Trade Offer\nLet's consider trading Wheat for Brick or Ore, as they have higher values.\n\n- **Option 1:** Offer Wheat for Brick\n  - We previously offered 2 Wheat for 1 Brick and were rejected. Let's try a more appealing offer: 3 Wheat for 1 Brick.\n  - New Quantities: Wheat: 12 - 3 = 9, Brick: 10 + 1 = 11\n  - Value Change: Lose 3*6 = 18, Gain 1*24 = 24, Net Gain: 6\n\n- **Option 2:** Offer Wheat for Ore\n  - Consider offering Wheat for Ore: 4 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n  - New Quantities: Wheat: 12 - 4 = 8, Ore: 26 + 1 = 27\n  - Value Change: Lose 4*6 = 24, Gain 1*37 = 37, Net Gain: 13\n\nGiven the positive net gain, both options are potentially beneficial, but offering Wheat for Ore seems more valuable.\n\n### Step 5: Make the Trade Offer\nLet's make the trade offer: [Offer: 4 Wheat, -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]}$",

      "response": "## Step 1: Review the current state of resources after the trades.\nInitially, Player 0 had: Wheat = 21, Wood = 10, Sheep = 7, Brick = 9, Ore = 25.\nAfter the first trade (5 Wheat -> 1 Brick), Player 0 has: Wheat = 16, Wood = 10, Sheep = 7, Brick = 10, Ore = 25.\nAfter the second trade (4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep), Player 0 has: Wheat = 12, Wood = 10, Sheep = 8, Brick = 10, Ore = 25.\nAfter the third trade (3 Wood -> 1 Ore), Player 0 has: Wheat = 12, Wood = 7, Sheep = 8, Brick = 10, Ore = 26.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the last offers made and the response.\nThe last offer made by Player 0 was (4 Wheat -> 1 Ore) which was rejected by Player 1. The offer before that was (2 Wheat -> 1 Brick) which was also rejected. We need to consider the current resources and think about a new offer.\n\n## Step 3: Assess the current resources and their values.\nCurrent resources: Wheat = 12 (Value: 6), Wood = 7 (Value: 10), Sheep = 8 (Value: 16), Brick = 10 (Value: 24), Ore = 26 (Value: 37).\nTotal value = (12*6) + (7*10) + (8*16) + (10*24) + (26*37) = 72 + 70 + 128 + 240 + 962 = 1472.\n\n## Step 4: Consider potential trades.\nTo increase the total value, we should consider trading resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given the values, Ore (37) is the most valuable, followed by Brick (24), Sheep (16), Wood (10), and then Wheat (6).\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a new trade offer based on the current situation and the goal to increase total value.\nSince Ore is the most valuable resource and we have a significant amount of it, we should be cautious about giving it away. We have already received Brick and Sheep in previous trades. Considering the values, offering Wheat (the least valuable resource) for either Brick or Ore could be a good strategy.\n\n## Step 6: Decide on a specific trade offer.\nWe can offer Wheat for Ore or Brick since both are more valuable than Wheat. Let's consider offering Wheat for Ore. We have 12 Wheat, and offering some of it for Ore could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 7: Propose a trade.\nLet's offer 5 Wheat for 1 Ore. This is a trade that could potentially increase our total value since 1 Ore (37) is more valuable than 5 Wheat (5*6 = 30).\n\n## Step 8: Format the trade offer according to the game's syntax.\nThe offer should be: [Offer: 5 Wheat,  -> 1 Ore].\n\n## Step 9: Write the trade offer in the required format.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]}$",
