Let's re-evaluate after the first trade.\nInitial Resources:\n  + [Wheat]   Qty: 15   Value: 6 (90)\n  + [Wood]    Qty: 16   Value: 10 (160)\n  + [Sheep]   Qty: 14   Value: 14 (196)\n  + [Brick]   Qty: 9    Value: 28 (252)\n  + [Ore]     Qty: 10   Value: 40 (400)\nInitial Total Value: 90 + 160 + 196 + 252 + 400 = 1098\n\nAfter 1st trade: Player 0 offered: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> Player 1 accepted: 3 Brick\n  - Wheat: 15 - 10 = 5 (5 * 6 = 30)\n  - Wood: 16 - 5 = 11 (11 * 10 = 110)\n  - Sheep: 14 (14 * 14 = 196)\n  - Brick: 9 + 3 = 12 (12 * 28 = 336)\n  - Ore: 10 (10 * 40 = 400)\nCurrent Total Value: 30 + 110 + 196 + 336 + 400 = 1072.\n\nThe first trade decreased my total value. This is a mistake. I need to focus on increasing value.\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources.\n\nPlayer 1 offered: 4 Wood, 3 Sheep -> Requested items: 3 Brick\nMy resources: Wheat: 5, Wood: 11, Sheep: 14, Brick: 12, Ore: 10\n\nValue of offer:\n  - 4 Wood: 4 * 10 = 40\n  - 3 Sheep: 3 * 14 = 42\n  Total offered value: 40 + 42 = 82\n\nValue of requested:\n  - 3 Brick: 3 * 28 = 84\n\nThis trade would be a slight loss (82 for 84). I'll deny it.\n\nI need to make an offer that increases my value.\nI have a good amount of Ore. Ore is high value. Brick is also high value.\n\nPerhaps I can trade some Sheep and Wood for Ore.\nOr trade Wheat for something higher value. I have 5 Wheat left.\n\nConsider offering lower value for higher value items.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore or Brick.\n\nI have 11 Wood, 14 Sheep, 12 Brick, 10 Ore, 5 Wheat.\nI need to make up for the value lost in the first trade.\n\nLet's try to trade some Wood and Sheep for Brick or Ore.\nOffer: 5 Wood (50 value), 5 Sheep (70 value) = 120\nRequest: 3 Ore (120 value)\n\nThis would be a neutral trade if accepted, but it would shift me towards more high-value resources.\nLet's make it more appealing to Player 1 and slightly beneficial for me.\n\nMy resources:\n  Wheat: 5 (Value 6)\n  Wood: 11 (Value 10)\n  Sheep: 14 (Value 14)\n  Brick: 12 (Value 28)\n  Ore: 10 (Value 40)\n\nGoal: Increase total value.\n\nPrevious offer from Player 1: 4 Wood, 3 Sheep (82 value) for 3 Brick (84 value)\nThis implies Player 1 values Brick highly, and is willing to trade Wood and Sheep for it.\n\nI have 12 Brick. I don't want to get rid of Brick if I can get Ore.\n\nI have a decent amount of Brick. Value is 28.\nOre is 40.\nSheep is 14.\nWood is 10.\nWheat is 6.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nHow about offering some Brick for Ore?\nOffer: 2 Brick (56 value) -> 2 Ore (80 value) - This might be too much for Player 1.\nHow about: 2 Brick (56 value) -> 1 Ore (40 value), 1 Sheep (14 value). Total 54 value. No, that's a loss.\n\nWhat if I offer low-value items for a high-value item?\nOffer: 3 Wood (30), 2 Sheep (28) = 58 value\nRequest: 2 Brick (56) or 1 Ore (40)\nIf I request 2 Brick, it's a fair trade.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nOffer: 5 Sheep (70 value) -> 1 Ore (40 value), 1 Brick (28 value). Total 68 value for me. This is a slight win for me if accepted.\n[Accept]\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",
