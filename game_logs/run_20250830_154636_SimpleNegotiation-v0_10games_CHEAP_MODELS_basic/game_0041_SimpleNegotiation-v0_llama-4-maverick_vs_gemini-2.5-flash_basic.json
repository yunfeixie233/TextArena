      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I should analyze the current values and quantities I have and look for potential trades that could increase the total value.\n\nInitially, I have:\n- Wheat: 22 units @ 6 value/unit = 132 value\n- Wood: 25 units @ 9 value/unit = 225 value\n- Sheep: 15 units @ 14 value/unit = 210 value\n- Brick: 6 units @ 23 value/unit = 138 value\n- Ore: 21 units @ 34 value/unit = 714 value\n\nTotal initial value = 132 + 225 + 210 + 138 + 714 = 1419 value\n\nTo increase the total value, I should consider trading resources with lower values for those with higher values if possible. Given the initial quantities and values, Ore is the highest value resource, and I have a substantial quantity of it. However, trading away too much Ore might not be strategic unless I get a significantly higher value resource in return.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. **Trading away lower-value resources:** Wheat (6 value/unit) and Wood (9 value/unit) are the lowest value resources. Trading them away for higher value resources could be beneficial.\n\n2. **Current distribution:** I have a good amount of Ore (34 value/unit) and Sheep (14 value/unit), moderate amounts of Wood (9 value/unit) and Wheat (6 value/unit), and a low amount of Brick (23 value/unit).\n\nTo start, I'll offer to trade some of my lower-value resources or those I have in abundance relative to others, for resources that are either higher in value or could potentially be used to make a more valuable trade in the future.\n\nLet's start by potentially trading away some Wheat or Wood for Brick, as Brick is of higher value than both Wheat and Wood.\n\n**Turn 1 Action:**\nI'll offer 10 Wheat (Value: 60) for 2 Brick (Value: 46), as it's not a great trade in terms of value but could be a starting point. However, upon careful consideration, this doesn't seem like a great trade due to the value disparity.\n\nInstead, I'll consider: `[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]`\n\nThis trade involves:\n- Giving away: 5 Wood (45 value) + 2 Wheat (12 value) = 57 value\n- Receiving: 1 Ore (34 value) + 1 Brick (23 value) = 57 value\n\nIt's a value-neutral trade, but it doesn't increase my total value. Let's aim for something better.\n\n**Alternative for Turn 1:**\nLet's directly propose a potentially more favorable trade based on the initial resources.\n\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Brick]`\n\n- Giving away: 10 Wheat (60 value)\n- Receiving: 2 Brick (46 value)\n\nThis is not a good trade for me.\n\nLet's directly think about a more reasonable trade:\n`[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Sheep]`\n\n- Giving away: 3 Wood (27 value)\n- Receiving: 1 Sheep (14 value)\n\nThis is not a good trade.\n\nRevisiting the initial resources and considering the values:\nLet's think about trading Wheat, the lowest value resource.\n\nUpon further consideration, here's a more reasonable starting trade:\n`[Offer: 8 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n\n- Giving away: 8 Wheat (48) + 1 Wood (9) = 57\n- Receiving: 1 Brick (23)\n\nThis still doesn't look great. Let's directly analyze the given resources and propose a potentially beneficial trade.\n\nFor the first turn, I'll start with a more conservative and exploratory trade offer that doesn't severely impact my resource balance.\n\nLet's directly formulate a reasonable trade.\n\nSince I have to follow the format strictly and directly provide an action for Turn 1, I'll directly choose a trade.\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick]`\n\nLet's see how the game progresses.\n\n**Action for Turn 1:**\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick]`",

Player 0 offered: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick. Rejected by Player 1.\n2. Player 1 offered: 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep. Rejected by Player 0.\n3. Player 0 offered: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore. Rejected by Player 1.\n4. Player 1 made no new offer.\n5. Player 0 offered: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick. Rejected by Player 1.\n6. Player 1 made no new offer.\n\n#### Analysis:\n- The game is at Turn 7 (since the history includes 6 turns).\n- Previous offers have been rejected, indicating a need to reassess the trading strategy.\n- The total value of current resources is calculated as follows:\n  - Wheat: 22 * 6 = 132\n  - Wood: 25 * 9 = 225\n  - Sheep: 15 * 14 = 210\n  - Brick: 6 * 23 = 138\n  - Ore: 21 * 34 = 714\n  - Total Value = 132 + 225 + 210 + 138 + 714 = 1419\n\n#### Strategy:\nTo increase the total value, we should aim to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones. Given the current resource values, trading Wheat or Wood for other resources could be beneficial if we can get higher-value resources.\n\n#### New Offer:\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- Trading Wheat (Value: 6) or Wood (Value: 9) for higher-value resources like Ore (Value: 34), Brick (Value: 23), or Sheep (Value: 14) could be beneficial.\n- Given that previous offers were rejected, we need to make a more appealing offer.\n\nConsidering the values and the need to make an attractive offer, let's propose a trade that involves giving away some Wood (since we have a considerable quantity) in exchange for Ore or Brick.\n\n#### Trade Offer:\nWe have 25 Wood, and its value is 9. Let's offer 4 Wood -> 1 Ore. This trade involves giving away resources worth 36 (4*9) for 1 Ore worth 34, which is not beneficial. Let's adjust our strategy.\n\n#### Alternative Trade Offer:\nLet's directly aim to gain higher-value resources by offering a more balanced trade. \n\nSince Player 1 was not interested in our previous offers involving Wheat or Sheep for Ore or Brick, let's think about what we can offer that might be more appealing.\n\n#### Proposed Action:\nLet's offer: [Offer: 4 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 2 Ore]. \nThis involves giving away (4*9) + (1*6) = 36 + 6 = 42 value for (2*34) = 68 value. This is a gain of 26 in total value.\n\nThe action in the required format is: `[Offer: 4 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 2 Ore]`\n\n### Response:\n`[Offer: 4 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 2 Ore]`",
