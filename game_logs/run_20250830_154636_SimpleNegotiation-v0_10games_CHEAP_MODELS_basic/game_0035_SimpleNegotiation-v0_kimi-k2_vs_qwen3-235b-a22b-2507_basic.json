      "response": "Let me assess what has happened so far:\n\n- Only 6 negotiated turns of a 10-round game remain.  \n- I have attempted three times to acquire Brick by offering Sheep at very favorable ratios (2 Sheep \u2013 1 Brick, 3 Sheep \u2013 2 Brick, 5 Sheep \u2013 4 Brick) and all three were rejected.  \n- Player 1 tried once to take 4 Brick + 3 Sheep off my hands in exchange for 5 Wood + 5 Wheat, a deal that would net me \u201395 in value, so I rejected it.  \n- Otherwise, no offers have succeeded and I have not learned what Player 1\u2019s inventory looks like.\n\nNet result so far: my current holdings remain unchanged from the original:\n\n Wheat 18  (5 ea)  \n Wood 14   (11 ea)  \n Sheep 17 (12 ea)  \n Brick 12 (20 ea)  \n Ore   16 (32 ea)\n\nObservations\n1. Player 1 clearly values Brick highly\u2014he was unwilling to give up even 1 Brick at a ratio better than 1 Brick \u2264 2.5 Sheep (average of my three attempts).  \n2. Player 1 has plenty of Wood and Wheat, at least 5 units each, and likes to use those two resources to try to buy high-value Brick and Sheep.  \n3. I still have very high-valued Ore and Brick that I could profitably trade away if the return is strong.\n\nNext move\nBecause Player 1 does not seem ready to give up Brick at any realistic Sheep ratio, I need to pivot:\n\n- I currently have 16 Ore (value 32 each). I can spare a few Ore and still remain very competitive if the return rate is high enough.\n- Player 1 appears to value Brick and Sheep highly; I should try to exploit that by offering Ore for Brick/Sheep at a premium that still leaves me ahead in value.\n- Since step count is ticking down (Turn 4 is next of 10) I cannot forever test Player 1\u2019s lower bound.\n\nTherefore, I will make a new offer that gives Player 1 a high-calorie Ore package in return for Brick/Sheep; the value increase for me must be immediate.\n\n[Offer: 4 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]",
