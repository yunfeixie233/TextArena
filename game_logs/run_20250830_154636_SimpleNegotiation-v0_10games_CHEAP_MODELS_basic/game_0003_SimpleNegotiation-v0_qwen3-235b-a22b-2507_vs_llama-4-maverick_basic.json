For example, offering a combination that includes higher-value items or more quantity.\n\nConsidering the above, I'll make a new offer that is potentially more attractive:\n- **[Offer: 10 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**\n\nThis offer increases the value given to Player 0 by including 1 Sheep (Value: 15), in addition to 10 Wheat (Value: 50), totaling a value of 65 for 1 Ore (Value: 36).
