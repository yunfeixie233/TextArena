      "response": "To start, let's assess the resources and their total value.\n\nThe resources and their values are as follows:\n- Wheat: 9 units * 6 = 54\n- Wood: 17 units * 9 = 153\n- Sheep: 13 units * 12 = 156\n- Brick: 5 units * 20 = 100\n- Ore: 20 units * 32 = 640\n\nTotal value = 54 + 153 + 156 + 100 + 640 = 1103\n\nTo increase the total value, we need to make trades that are beneficial. Let's consider what we have and what we can offer or request.\n\nWe have a lot of Ore (high value) and Wood (moderate value), and a decent amount of Sheep. Brick is relatively scarce for us, and Wheat, while not very valuable, is also something we have a fair amount of.\n\nLet's make an initial offer to see if we can increase our total value. Since Ore is very valuable and we have a lot of it, we might want to trade some of it for other resources that could be undervalued or for resources we need more of.\n\nConsidering the current distribution, an initial offer could involve trading some Ore for other resources.\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. We have a lot of Ore, so offering Ore could be a good start.\n2. Brick is relatively less in quantity, and its value is high, so getting more Brick could be beneficial.\n3. Let's think about offering some Ore for Brick.\n\n### Initial Offer:\nLet's offer 2 Ore for 1 Brick. Since Ore is valued at 32 and Brick at 20, offering 2 Ore (64 value) for 1 Brick (20 value) doesn't seem like a good trade. We need to think about trades that are more balanced.\n\n### Alternative Offer:\nLet's consider offering some Wood or Sheep for Brick since they are less valuable than Ore. \n\nFor instance, offering 3 Sheep (36 value) for 2 Brick (40 value) could be a reasonable trade because it slightly increases our total value.\n\n### Let's Make an Offer:\n'[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]'\n\nThis is the first turn, and we're making an offer to potentially increase our resource value. Let's wait for the opponent's response. \n\n### Action:\n'[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]'",

      "response": "### Analysis of Current Resources and Previous Trades\n\nLet's analyze the current situation:\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 9 (Value: 6)\n   - Wood: 17 (Value: 9)\n   - Sheep: 13 (Value: 12)\n   - Brick: 5 (Value: 20)\n   - Ore: 20 (Value: 32)\n\n2. **Previous Trades:**\n   - Offered 3 Sheep for 2 Brick. Since 1 Sheep = 12 and 1 Brick = 20, the trade involved giving up 3*12 = 36 value for 2*20 = 40 value. The net gain is +4 value.\n   - After the trade: Sheep = 10, Brick = 7.\n   - Then, offered 4 Wheat for 2 Wood. The offer was rejected.\n   - The values involved in the second offer: 4 Wheat = 4*6 = 24, 2 Wood = 2*9 = 18. This trade would have resulted in a loss.\n\n### Calculating Current Total Value\n\nLet's calculate the total value of the resources after the first trade:\n- Wheat: 9 * 6 = 54\n- Wood: 17 * 9 = 153\n- Sheep: 10 * 12 = 120 (after giving 3 Sheep)\n- Brick: 7 * 20 = 140 (after receiving 2 Brick)\n- Ore: 20 * 32 = 640\n\nTotal Value = 54 + 153 + 120 + 140 + 640 = 1107\n\n### Planning the Next Trade\n\nTo increase the total value, we need to identify beneficial trades. We should look for trades where the value of what we receive is greater than what we offer.\n\n1. **Potential Trades:**\n   - Consider offering resources with lower values per unit for those with higher values.\n   - We have a lot of Ore (high value) and Wood (medium value), and a decent amount of Sheep.\n\n2. **Possible Trade:**\n   - One potential trade could involve offering some Wheat (low value) or Wood (medium value) for a resource that is relatively scarce or valuable to us.\n\n### Evaluating Specific Trade Opportunities\n\nLet's examine a trade that could be beneficial:\n- Offering 5 Wood (5*9 = 45) for 1 Ore (1*32 = 32) is not beneficial because we're losing value (45 > 32).\n- Offering 2 Wheat (2*6 = 12) for 1 Sheep (1*12 = 12) is not beneficial as it doesn't increase our value.\n- However, offering some Wheat for Brick could be beneficial since Brick has a higher value per unit than Wheat.\n\n### Formulating a Trade Offer\n\nLet's formulate a trade:\n- Offer 5 Wheat for 1 Brick. \n  - We're giving up 5*6 = 30 value.\n  - We're getting 1*20 = 20 value.\n  This trade is still not beneficial.\n\nLet's think about another trade:\n- We have a lot of Ore and could potentially offer some for a higher quantity of a less valuable resource isn't a good idea, but offering a less valuable resource for a more valuable one is.\n\n### Actual Trade Offer\n\nLet's consider a more promising trade:\n- Offer 4 Wood (4*9 = 36) for 2 Sheep (2*12 = 24) is not beneficial.\n- However, if we think about acquiring more valuable resources or getting rid of less valuable ones, we could offer Wheat or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's directly formulate a reasonable trade:\n- Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore\n  - Giving up: 6*6 = 36\n  - Getting: 1*32 = 32\n  Still not beneficial.\n\n### New Offer\n\nAfter reconsideration:\n- Let's offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore\n  - Giving up: 2*12 = 24\n  - Getting: 1*32 = 32\n  This trade is beneficial.\n\nThe trade in the required format is: `[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`.",

      "response": "### Current State\n\nAfter the last turn, we have the following state:\n\n- Resources:\n  - Wheat: 9 - 4 = 5 (since the offer of 4 Wheat was rejected)\n  - Wood: 17 - 2 = 15\n  - Sheep: 13 - 3 + 2 - 2 = 10\n  - Brick: 5 + 2 = 7\n  - Ore: 20 - 1 - 1 = 18\n\nLet's compute the total value of our current resources:\n- Wheat: 5 * 6 = 30\n- Wood: 15 * 9 = 135\n- Sheep: 10 * 12 = 120\n- Brick: 7 * 20 = 140\n- Ore: 18 * 32 = 576\n\nTotal value = 30 + 135 + 120 + 140 + 576 = 1001\n\n### Next Action\n\nTo decide on the next action, let's analyze our resources and their values.\n\n1. **Identify Valuable Resources**: Ore is the most valuable resource, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n   \n2. **Current Holdings**: We have a good amount of Ore, a decent amount of Brick and Wood, and a fair amount of Sheep.\n\n3. **Potential Trades**: We need to think about what we can offer and what we should request to increase our total value.\n\n- We can consider offering resources that are less valuable to us and requesting those that are more valuable.\n- Since Ore is very valuable and we still have a significant amount, we might not want to give it away unless we get something of very high value in return.\n\n### Possible Offers\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. **Offering Wheat for more valuable resources**: We could offer Wheat (least valuable per unit among ours) for other resources. For example, offering 3-4 Wheat for 1 Wood or 1 Sheep could be considered.\n\n2. **Offering Wood for Ore or Brick**: Since we have a fair amount of Wood, we could consider offering some Wood for Ore or Brick, as both are more valuable.\n\n3. **Offering Sheep for Ore or Brick**: Sheep are relatively valuable. We could consider trading Sheep for Ore or Brick.\n\nLet's make an offer:\n- **[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]**: This is a potential offer to increase the quantity of Sheep, which is more valuable than Wheat.\n\nLet's calculate the outcome if this offer is accepted:\n- Wheat: 5 - 4 = 1\n- Sheep: 10 + 2 = 12\n\nNew total value if accepted:\n- Wheat: 1 * 6 = 6\n- Wood: 15 * 9 = 135\n- Sheep: 12 * 12 = 144\n- Brick: 7 * 20 = 140\n- Ore: 18 * 32 = 576\n\nTotal = 6 + 135 + 144 + 140 + 576 = 1001\n\nThis trade doesn't seem to increase our total value significantly. Let's consider another option.\n\n### Alternative Offer\n\n- **[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]**: This trade involves giving away less valuable Wood for more valuable Brick.\n\nOutcome if accepted:\n- Wood: 15 - 2 = 13\n- Brick: 7 + 1 = 8\n\nNew total value:\n- Wheat: 5 * 6 = 30\n- Wood: 13 * 9 = 117\n- Sheep: 10 * 12 = 120\n- Brick: 8 * 20 = 160\n- Ore: 18 * 32 = 576\n\nTotal = 30 + 117 + 120 + 160 + 576 = 1003\n\nThis trade slightly increases our total value.\n\n### Decision\n\nLet's go with: **[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]** is a bit too much to offer, so let's simplify to **[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]**.\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
