In the late turns I should try to offload surplus low-value Wheat (6 / card) in exchange for more high-value Brick or maybe some extra Ore when possible.\n\nCurrent inventory after all finished trades:\n\nWheat 18, Wood 14, Sheep 22, Brick 22, Ore 17  \n\nNext move:\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
