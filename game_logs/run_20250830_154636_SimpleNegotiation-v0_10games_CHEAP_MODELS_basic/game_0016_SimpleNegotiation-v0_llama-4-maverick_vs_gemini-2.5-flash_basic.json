Adjusting quantities or the type of resource requested/offered can be done based on the opponent's response.\n\n### Response Preparation\n\nWe will wait for the opponent's response to our offer. If they accept, we'll proceed with the trade. If they deny or make a counteroffer, we'll reassess and decide accordingly.\n\nLet's execute the first move.\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'",

      "response": "To increase the total value of my resources, I need to make strategic trades. Let's analyze the current situation:\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 7, Value: 6\n   - Wood: 15, Value: 12\n   - Sheep: 11, Value: 12\n   - Brick: 17, Value: 25\n   - Ore: 14, Value: 34\n\n2. **Total Value:** (7*6) + (15*12) + (11*12) + (17*25) + (14*34) = 42 + 180 + 132 + 425 + 476 = 1255\n\n3. **Previous Attempts:**\n   - I offered 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, which was rejected.\n   - Then, I offered 3 Brick for 1 Ore, which was also rejected.\n   - Lastly, I offered 2 Brick for 1 Ore, and it was rejected again.\n\n4. **Analysis:**\n   - Player 1 is not willing to give up Ore for the offers made so far. This suggests that either they don't need what I'm offering or they value Ore highly and need it for themselves.\n   - The value of Ore is high (34), so giving it away is costly. However, my offers might have been undervaluing it.\n\n5. **New Strategy:**\n   - Since previous attempts to get Ore directly were met with rejection, I should consider alternative trades that could be beneficial or at least not detrimental.\n   - Let's examine other resources I can offer or request that might be more appealing to Player 1.\n\n6. **Action:**\n   - Let's try to offer something that hasn't been offered before. One strategy is to offer a resource I have in abundance (relative to its value) for a resource that is highly valued.\n   - I notice that I have a significant quantity of Wood (15) with a moderate value (12). If I can get a more valuable resource for it, that could be beneficial.\n   - Let's make an offer: Offer 4 Wood for 1 Sheep. This is a reasonable trade because I'm offering resources worth 48 (4*12) for resources worth 12. However, this might not be attractive to Player 1 if they need Sheep. Let's adjust our strategy.\n\nGiven the constraints and observing that Ore is highly valued and I need to negotiate effectively, let's directly aim to improve my resource value.\n\nLet's make a new offer that could be more appealing:\n'[Offer: 4 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThe rationale is that I'm offering (4*12 + 1*12) = 60 worth of resources for 1 Ore worth 34, which is not a good trade for me. However, my previous attempts to directly get Ore were unsuccessful. Let's try to think about what Player 1 might want or be able to offer.\n\nLet's adjust the offer to something potentially more balanced or appealing to both parties.\n\n'[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]' is a more balanced trade in terms of value (3*25 = 75 for 1*34 = 34), but it was rejected. Let's increase the offered Brick to make it more appealing.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Brick -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nHowever, let's think about an even more strategic move considering my resources and the previous rejections.\n\nLet's directly analyze and adjust:\n- Offering more Brick for Ore has been tried. Let's think about other resources.\n\nLet's make a different offer:\n'[Offer: 5 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Ore]'.\n\nThis offer is (5*12 + 1*6) = 66 for (2*34) = 68. It's almost balanced and shows I'm willing to negotiate.\n\nMy action: [Offer: 5 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Ore].",

Since the value decreased, it might not have been the best trade.\n- We still need to acquire more valuable resources or maintain the current ones.\n\nConsidering the current resources and the goal to increase the total value:\n- We can try to offer resources that are relatively less valuable to us and request more valuable ones.\n\nLet's examine the current resources and possible trades:\n- Offering Wheat or Sheep might not be very beneficial as they are not very valuable.\n- We have a good amount of Brick, and its value is considerable.\n\nGiven that the last trade didn't increase our total value, let's make a new offer that could potentially be more beneficial. We can offer some Wood and Sheep for more Ore or other valuable resources.\n\nLet's make a new offer: \n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer is to see if we can get more Ore, which is one of the most valuable resources. \n\nAction: [Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
