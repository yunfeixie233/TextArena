Accumulate more scarce/high-value resources (especially Sheep and Brick)\n2. Offload abundant/low-value resources (Wheat/Wood)\n\n### Action\nSince Sheep and Brick are my highest **per-unit** value resources ($17 and $25 respectively), I want to get more of these. I\u2019ll target Wood (my lowest $/unit at $10) and some Ore (even though Ore is high absolute value, I have plenty of it).\n\n**Opening Offer**: I propose to exchange some Ore and Wood for Brick and any Sheep I can acquire.
