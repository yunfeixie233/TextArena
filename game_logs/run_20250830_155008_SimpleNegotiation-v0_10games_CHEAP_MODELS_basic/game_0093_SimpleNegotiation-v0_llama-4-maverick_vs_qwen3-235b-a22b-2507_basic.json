However, I can consider trading some of the less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- Trading Wheat or Wood for Sheep, Brick, or Ore could be beneficial as it increases the total value.\n\nLet's make an initial offer to trade some Wheat (Value: 6) for Sheep (Value: 15), as Sheep is more valuable than Wheat.\n\n### Offer Calculation\n\nLet's offer 10 Wheat for 4 Sheep:\n- Giving away: 10 Wheat = 10 * 6 = 60 value\n- Requesting: 4 Sheep = 4 * 15 = 60 value\n\nThis trade maintains the current total value but could be a starting point for negotiation. Let's slightly adjust it to gain value:\n- Offer 8 Wheat for 4 Sheep:\n  - Giving away: 8 Wheat = 8 * 6 = 48 value\n  - Requesting: 4 Sheep = 4 * 15 = 60 value\n\nThis trade increases the total value.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 8 Wheat, -> 4 Sheep]` is not correctly formatted. The correct format should include something on both sides of the arrow. Let's correct this and make a proper offer.\n\n`[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 4 Sheep]`\n\nThis is my action for Turn 1.",

So, offering 4 Wheat for 2 Sheep could be beneficial as it increases the value (24 < 30).\n\n## Step 7: Propose a new trade offer\nLet's propose: Offered items: 6 Wheat -> Requested items: 3 Sheep.\n- Value of 6 Wheat = 6 * 6 = 36\n- Value of 3 Sheep = 3 * 15 = 45\nThis trade increases the total value.\n\n## Step 8: Check if the proposed trade is feasible with the current quantities\n- Wheat: 22 - 6 = 16 (feasible)\n- Sheep: 20 + 3 = 23 (feasible)\n\n## Step 9: Format the proposed trade according to the game's special tokens\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 3 Sheep]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 3 Sheep]}$",
