      "response": "Okay, I understand the game. I am Player 0, and my goal is to increase the total value of my resources through trading. I have 10 turns.\n\nMy current resources and their values are:\n*   [Wheat]   Qty: 6    Value: 6\n*   [Wood]    Qty: 7    Value: 10\n*   [Sheep]   Qty: 9    Value: 12\n*   [Brick]   Qty: 18   Value: 27\n*   [Ore]     Qty: 23   Value: 40\n\nMy current total value is 6 + 10 + 12 + 27 + 40 = 95.\nI need to make smart offers to increase this value. I will try to trade resources I have in abundance or perceive as less valuable for resources I need or that have higher value for me.\n\nLet's start with my first offer. I have a lot of Brick and Ore, and while their individual values are high, I might be able to get even more valuable resources for them based on other players' needs or my own. I also have a decent amount of Sheep and Wood. Wheat is my lowest quantity and value.\n\nI want to try to get more diversified resources or higher value resources for what I have. I have a good amount of Ore, and it's quite valuable. I have a lot of Brick. I might try to get some Wheat for cheap, or more Sheep if I can get a good deal, but primarily, I want to increase my overall value.\n\nLet's try to offload some Brick and get something more valuable in return, or something I'm low on. Or perhaps trade some less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nOffer 1 (Turn 1):\nI have a lot of Brick. Let's see if I can convert some of that into something else.\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis is offering 3 * (27/18) = 4.5 value of Brick for 1 Ore (value 40). This is a bad deal for the other player if they are calculating solely on my given values. However, perhaps they need Brick desperately. My hope is to gain Ore, which is high value.\n\nLet me rethink. My aim is to increase *my* value.\nValue of 1 Brick: 27 / 18 = 1.5\nValue of 1 Ore: 40 / 23 = 1.74 approximately\nValue of 1 Sheep: 12 / 9 = 1.33 approximately\nValue of 1 Wood: 10 / 7 = 1.42 approximately\nValue of 1 Wheat: 6 / 6 = 1.0\n\nMy values per unit:\nOre: 1.74\nBrick: 1.5\nWood: 1.42\nSheep: 1.33\nWheat: 1.0\n\nSo Ore has the highest per-unit value for me. Wheat has the lowest.\nI have a lot of Brick (18) and Ore (23). I have plenty of Sheep (9) and Wood (7). Wheat (6) is my lowest.\n\nI want to trade resources with lower per-unit value for those with higher per-unit value, or simply get more resources than I give away in terms of total value.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, or trade off some Wheat.\nI have 6 Wheat. What if I try to get something better for it? It's cheap, so maybe I can bundle it.\n\nMaybe I can offer something where I have abundance (Brick, Ore) for something I might need, or for something that gives me a net value gain. I have a lot of Ore, but it's also my most valuable per unit.\n\nLet's look for a trade that gives me an immediate value bump.\nI have 18 Brick. 1.5 value per brick.\nI have 23 Ore. 1.74 value per ore.\n\nWhat if I offer a resource that is abundant (say Brick or Sheep) for something I want more of (Ore, or even diversifying with more Wood/Wheat if the ratio is good)?\n\nLet's try to get rid of some Brick for something I value more *per unit*, or just get more quantity.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore]\nMy outgoing value: 5 * 1.5 = 7.5\nMy incoming value: 2 * 1.74 = 3.48\nThis is a bad trade for me! I need to ensure my incoming value is higher than my outgoing.\n\nOkay, I need to make offers that *increase my value*.\n\nResources I want more of (higher per-unit value for me): Ore (1.74), Wood (1.42), Sheep (1.33), Wheat (1.0).\nResources I have a lot of: Brick (1.5), Ore (1.74).\n\nI have plenty of Brick. What can I get for it that makes sense?\nSuppose I offer 3 Brick (Value 4.5) for 2 Sheep (Value 2.66)? Still bad for me.\nSuppose I offer 2 Brick (Value 3) for 1 Wood (Value 1.42)? Still bad for me.\n\nThe values are relatively close for my resources except for Ore being clearly highest and Wheat clearly lowest.\n\nLet's try to get something useful. I have 6 Wheat. It's the lowest individual value item.\nMaybe I can trade some higher value items for a good quantity of lower value items, but that total value is higher.\n\nLet's try to gain more of my highest value item \"Ore\" or trade off lower value items.\n\nWhat if I give up some less valuable items for more valuable items?\nI have plenty of Sheep and Brick.\n\nOffer 1 (Turn 1):\nI have 9 Sheep (1.33/unit) and 18 Brick (1.5/unit). I want more Ore (1.74/unit).\nPerhaps I can get 1 Ore for some Sheep and Brick?\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]\nValue out: (2 * 1.33) + (3 * 1.5) = 2.66 + 4.5 = 7.16\nValue in: (2 * 1.74) = 3.48\nThis is still bad for me! I must ensure the requested resources value is higher than offered.\n\nLet's try to simplify. I have a lot of Brick.\nI want to increase my total value.\n\nMy current resources and their values are:\n*   [Wheat]   Qty: 6    Value: 6 (1.0/unit)\n*   [Wood]    Qty: 7    Value: 10 (1.42/unit)\n*   [Sheep]   Qty: 9    Value: 12 (1.33/unit)\n*   [Brick]   Qty: 18   Value: 27 (1.5/unit)\n*   [Ore]     Qty: 23   Value: 40 (1.74/unit)\n\nI have an excess of Brick and Ore.\nIf I can trade my resources in a way that *I gain value*, that's the goal.\n\nLet's try to trade Brick for Ore at a favorable rate for me.\nMy Brick is 1.5/unit. My Ore is 1.74/unit.\nI want to offer fewer \"value units\" than I receive.\n\nIf I offer 3 Brick (4.5 value) and ask for 2 Ore (3.48 value), it's bad.\nIf I offer 2 Brick (3 value) and ask for 1 Ore (1.74 value), it's bad.\n\nThis means I need to offer a lot of my lower value items to get fewer of my high value items to make it work.\nFor example, to gain 1 Ore (value 1.74), I would need to give up less than 1.74 value.\nI have Wheat (1.0/unit) and Sheep (1.33/unit).\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood]\nValue out: 2 * 1.0 = 2.0\nValue in: 1 * (10/7) = 1.42\nThis is bad. The other player would love this.\n\nMy goal is to increase my own value.\n\nLet's consider trading what I have a lot of (Brick, Ore) for something else, but ensuring I profit.\nOr trading what I have little of (Wheat) for something I need.\n\nMy current strategy: Focus on trading quantities of lower unit value resources for higher unit value resources, or simply more resources than I give away in terms of total value.\n\nI have 6 Wheat. It's my lowest unit value. Let's try to get rid of it for something better.\nPerhaps I can get some Sheep for my Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]\nMy outgoing value: 3 Wheat * (6/6) = 3 * 1.0 = 3.0\nMy incoming value: 2 Sheep * (12/9) = 2 * 1.33 = 2.66\nThis is also a loss.\n\nThis implies my current individual values per unit are quite linear.\nI need to find a trade where the other player values something differently than I do, or I need to offer a good quantity of my resources for a proportionally smaller quantity of their desirable resources but at a *higher total value* for myself.\n\nLet's try to make an offer where I propose a large quantity of a relatively common resource from my inventory (Brick or Sheep) and ask for a smaller quantity of a seemingly more valuable resource (Ore or Wood).\n\n**Offer 1 (Turn 1):**\nI have a good quantity of Brick. Let's try to convert some of it into my highest value resource, Ore, at a beneficial rate.\nI have Brick at 1.5 value per unit, and Ore at 1.74 value per unit.\nIf I offer 1 Ore, I need to get back more than 1.74 value.\nIf I ask for 1 Ore, I need to offer less than 1.74 value.\n\nLet's try this:\n[Offer: 3 Ore -> 5 Brick]\nValue out: 3 * (40/23) = 3 * 1.74 = 5.22\nValue in: 5 * (27/18) = 5 * 1.5 = 7.5\nThis is a gain of 7.5 - 5.22 = 2.28 for me. This is a good trade for me, assuming the other player is willing to part with Brick. I am giving up my highest per-unit value item for more of my second highest per-unit value item, but gaining overall value.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable offer to increase my total value, assuming the other player finds 5 Brick more appealing than 3 Ore.\n\n**Final decision for Turn 1:**\n[Offer: 3 Ore -> 5 Brick]",

For example, we could think of offering fewer Brick or requesting more Ore.\n\n## Step 5: Propose a counteroffer.\nLet's consider what we can offer instead. If we think 1 Ore is too low for 3 Brick, we could suggest: [Offer: 2 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore].\n\nLet's check the value:\n- 2 Brick = 2 * 24 = 48\n- 1 Sheep = 1 * 12 = 12\n- Total given = 48 + 12 = 60\n- 1 Ore = 35 (requested)\n\nThis still isn't a great trade for us since we're giving up 60 worth of resources for 35.\n\nLet's try to adjust:\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore] could be a more balanced counteroffer.\n- 1 Brick = 24\n- 1 Ore = 35\n\nThis trade is still not great but is more balanced.\n\nThe response should be in the required format.

      "response": "### Current State of Resources\n\nBefore making a new decision, let's assess the current state of my resources:\n\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 19 - 4 = 15   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 19   Value: 8\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 6   Value: 12\n- [Brick]   Qty: 14 - 3 = 11   Value: 24\n- [Ore]     Qty: 17   Value: 35\n\n### Analysis of Previous Offers\n\n1. **Player 0's Initial Offer**: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore\n   - My Response: [Deny]\n   - Value Given: 3 Brick = 3 * 24 = 72\n   - Value Received: 1 Ore = 1 * 35 = 35\n   - Since 35 < 72, it was a good decision to deny.\n\n2. **My Counteroffer**: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore\n   - Player 0's Response: [Deny]\n   - Indicates Player 0 did not see the trade as beneficial.\n\n3. **Subsequent Offers**:\n   - I made several offers to trade Wheat for Sheep (5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep, 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep twice).\n   - All were rejected, suggesting that either the quantity or the type of resources offered was not favorable for Player 0.\n\n### New Offer Decision\n\nLet's consider making a new offer that could be more appealing to Player 0.\n\n1. **Evaluate Resources**:\n   - I have a surplus of Wheat, Wood, and Ore relative to Sheep and Brick.\n\n2. **Potential Trade**:\n   - To gain Sheep (Value: 12), I could offer resources that are less valuable to me but potentially more valuable to Player 0.\n\n3. **New Offer**:\n   - Let's try offering Wood (Value: 8) for Sheep (Value: 12). A potential trade could be: 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep.\n   - Value Given: 2 * 8 = 16\n   - Value Received: 1 * 12 = 12\n   - Although this seems like a slightly unfavorable trade due to the values (16 given for 12 received), it might be worth trying because it increases my Sheep quantity.\n\n### Action\n\nGiven the previous rejections and the need to make a meaningful trade, I'll make a new offer:\n\n`[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nLet's see how Player 0 responds.\n\n### Response to Potential Incoming Offer\n\nSince Player 0 made no new trade offer, my action is to make the new offer.\n\n`[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep]`",
