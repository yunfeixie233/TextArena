      "response": "### Initial Analysis\n\nTo maximize the total value of my resources, I need to understand the current distribution and value of the resources I hold.\n\n1. **Current Resources and Their Total Value:**\n   - Wheat: 5 units, Value: 6/unit = 5 * 6 = 30\n   - Wood: 22 units, Value: 11/unit = 22 * 11 = 242\n   - Sheep: 22 units, Value: 16/unit = 22 * 16 = 352\n   - Brick: 21 units, Value: 28/unit = 21 * 28 = 588\n   - Ore: 25 units, Value: 40/unit = 25 * 40 = 1000\n\n   Total Value = 30 + 242 + 352 + 588 + 1000 = 2212\n\n2. **Identifying Potential Trades:**\n   - To increase the total value, I should look to trade resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable or at least maintain value while possibly gaining quantity.\n\n3. **Initial Strategy:**\n   - I have a significant amount of Ore (Value: 40/unit), Brick (Value: 28/unit), and Sheep (Value: 16/unit). I should consider offering some of these for resources that might be undervalued or for more valuable resources if possible.\n\n### Turn 1 Analysis\n\nLet's examine potential trades. Since I have a lot of Ore, which is my most valuable resource, I should be cautious about trading it away. However, I can consider offering some Ore or other abundant resources for something of potentially higher value or for diversification.\n\n### First Action\n\nI'll start by making an offer that involves trading some of my less valuable resources relative to Ore or my other abundant resources. \n\nLet's send an offer: `[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 4 Ore, 3 Wheat]`\n\nThis offer involves giving away:\n- 5 Sheep = 5 * 16 = 80 value\n- 2 Brick = 2 * 28 = 56 value\nTotal given away = 80 + 56 = 136 value\n\nAnd receiving:\n- 4 Ore = 4 * 40 = 160 value\n- 3 Wheat = 3 * 6 = 18 value\nTotal received = 160 + 18 = 178 value\n\nThis seems like a potentially good trade as I'm gaining 42 value (178 - 136).\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 4 Ore, 3 Wheat]`",

      "response": "### Analysis of Current Resources and Previous Trades\n\nLet's analyze the current state of resources and the previous trades:\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: Qty: 5, Value: 6\n   - Wood: Qty: 22, Value: 11\n   - Sheep: Qty: 22, Value: 16\n   - Brick: Qty: 21, Value: 28\n   - Ore: Qty: 25, Value: 40\n\n2. **Previous Trades and Outcomes:**\n   - Player 0 offered 5 Sheep, 2 Brick for 4 Ore, 3 Wheat. Player 1 rejected.\n   - Player 0 offered 7 Sheep, 3 Brick for 5 Ore, 2 Wood. Player 1 rejected.\n\n### Considerations for Next Trade\n\nTo improve the total value of resources, we should consider trading lower-value resources for higher-value ones or maintaining a good balance. Let's assess the previous offers and the current state:\n\n- The first offer (5 Sheep, 2 Brick for 4 Ore, 3 Wheat) was rejected. This offer was attempting to gain higher-value Ore and some Wheat, but it was rejected.\n- The second offer (7 Sheep, 3 Brick for 5 Ore, 2 Wood) was also rejected. This was another attempt to gain higher-value Ore and some Wood.\n\n### New Trade Offer Strategy\n\nLet's re-evaluate the resources and propose a new trade:\n\n1. **Identify Resources to Offer:**\n   - We have a surplus of Sheep and Brick. Let's consider offering some Sheep again since we have a significant quantity.\n\n2. **Identify Resources to Request:**\n   - Ore is the highest value resource, and we have a good quantity. However, let's consider not offering too much for it since previous attempts were rejected.\n   - Wood is the second lowest value resource we have a significant quantity of. Trading some lower-value or equally valued resources for a higher quantity of lower-value resources might not be as effective as focusing on gaining more of the higher-value resources.\n\n3. **Proposed Trade:**\n   Let's offer 4 Sheep, 1 Brick for 3 Ore. This reduces the quantity of Sheep offered compared to the previous attempts and still requests Ore, which is of higher value.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 3 Ore]`\n\nThis trade aims to balance the request for higher-value resources (Ore) with the offer of our surplus resources (Sheep and Brick), adjusting the quantities to be more appealing or at least worthy of consideration by Player 1.",

The current state of my resources is:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 5    Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 22   Value: 11\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 22   Value: 16\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 21   Value: 28\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 25   Value: 40\n\nSince my previous offers were rejected by Player 1, I will try to analyze the situation and make a new offer.\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I have a lot of Sheep, Brick, and Ore. I should try to trade some of them for resources that are scarce or have a high value.\n\nLet's examine my previous offers:\n1. Offered 5 Sheep, 2 Brick for 4 Ore, 3 Wheat. (Rejected)\n2. Offered 7 Sheep, 3 Brick for 5 Ore, 2 Wood. (Rejected)\n3. Offered 4 Sheep, 1 Brick for 3 Ore. (Rejected)\n4. Offered 5 Wood, 3 Sheep for 4 Ore. (Rejected)\n5. Offered 5 Wood, 2 Brick for 3 Ore. (Rejected)\n\nIt seems that Player 1 is not interested in trading for Wheat or Wood. They also rejected offers that involved trading Sheep and Brick for Ore. However, the offers that involved trading Wood for Ore were not rejected with a clear indication that Ore is not wanted.\n\nConsidering my current resources and the previous offers, I will make a new offer that involves trading some of my Brick for Ore.\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]",
