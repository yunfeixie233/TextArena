      "response": "I'm Player 0, and I'll play the Negotiation Game carefully. Here's my initial assessment of my resources:\n\n- Wheat: 21 units, Value: 6\n- Wood: 24 units, Value: 8\n- Sheep: 14 units, Value: 14\n- Brick: 11 units, Value: 20\n- Ore: 16 units, Value: 33\n\nTo maximize the total value of my resources, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or at least maintain the current total value while possibly setting up for future beneficial trades.\n\nAt the start, my total value is (21*6) + (24*8) + (14*14) + (11*20) + (16*33) = 126 + 192 + 196 + 220 + 528 = 1262.\n\nMy first move will be to analyze what I have and what might be a good initial trade. Since Ore has the highest value and I have a considerable amount of it, I might want to keep it. However, I also have a substantial amount of other resources. Let's start by making an offer that doesn't immediately give away too much but opens the negotiation.\n\nI'll offer some of my lower-value resources for something potentially more valuable or at least of equal value. Noting that Brick and Ore are my most valuable resources, I'll try not to give them away.\n\nOne possible trade could involve offering some Wheat or Wood (lower value resources) for something that could be of higher or comparable value.\n\nLet's make an initial offer: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Sheep, 2 Brick].\n\nThis offer gives away (5*6) + (4*8) = 30 + 32 = 62 worth of resources and requests (3*14) + (2*20) = 42 + 40 = 82 worth of resources. The requested resources are more valuable than what I'm offering, but it's a starting point for negotiation.\n\nMy action for Turn 1 is: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Sheep, 2 Brick].",

      "response": "### Analysis of Current Resources and Previous Trades\n\nTo determine the next step, let's first analyze the current state of resources and the trades made so far.\n\n#### Current Resources:\n- Wheat: 21 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 24 (Value: 8)\n- Sheep: 14 (Value: 14)\n- Brick: 11 (Value: 20)\n- Ore: 16 (Value: 33)\n\n#### Previous Trades:\n1. **First Offer by Player 0:** 5 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Sheep, 2 Brick\n   - Offered: 5 Wheat (Value: 30), 4 Wood (Value: 32) = Total Value: 62\n   - Requested: 3 Sheep (Value: 42), 2 Brick (Value: 40) = Total Value: 82\n   - **Rejected** by Player 1.\n\n2. **Second Offer by Player 0:** 4 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick\n   - Offered: 4 Wood (Value: 32), 4 Wheat (Value: 24) = Total Value: 56\n   - Requested: 2 Ore (Value: 66), 1 Brick (Value: 20) = Total Value: 86\n   - **Rejected** by Player 1.\n\n### Reasoning for Next Trade\n\nBoth offers were rejected, indicating that Player 1 did not find them favorable. Let's analyze the offers:\n\n1. The first offer aimed to increase the total value from 62 to 82 by trading Wheat and Wood for Sheep and Brick. The rejection suggests that either Player 1 did not have the requested resources or did not see the trade as beneficial.\n\n2. The second offer attempted to increase the total value from 56 to 86 by trading Wood and Wheat for Ore and Brick. Again, the rejection implies that the terms were not favorable for Player 1.\n\n### New Trade Offer\n\nLet's formulate a new offer that could be more appealing. We need to either offer something of higher value that we have in abundance or request something that is of high value but less abundant for us.\n\nGiven the rejection of previous offers, let's directly analyze the resources:\n\n- We have a surplus of Wood (24) and Wheat (21) but are low on Brick (11) and Sheep (14) relative to their values.\n- Ore (16) is valuable, and we have a moderate quantity.\n\nLet's consider a trade that involves giving away some of our less valuable resources (in terms of quantity or value) and acquiring something more valuable.\n\n**New Offer:**\n- Offer: 4 Wheat (Value: 24), 3 Wood (Value: 24) -> 1 Ore (Value: 33), 1 Sheep (Value: 14)\n  - Total Offered Value: 48\n  - Total Requested Value: 47\n\nHowever, to make a more appealing offer, let's directly offer something that could be more attractive:\n- **[Offer: 6 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 2 Sheep]**\n\nLet's calculate:\n- Offered: 6 Wheat (Value: 36), 2 Wood (Value: 16) = Total Value: 52\n- Requested: 1 Ore (Value: 33), 2 Sheep (Value: 28) = Total Value: 61\n\nThis offer is more balanced in terms of the increase in total value.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 6 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 2 Sheep]`",

Player 1's offer is: 3 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 6 Wheat, 3 Wood.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the value of the resources offered by Player 1 and the resources requested by Player 1.\nThe value of 3 Sheep is 3 * 14 = 42, and the value of 1 Ore is 1 * 33 = 33. So, the total value offered by Player 1 is 42 + 33 = 75. The value of 6 Wheat is 6 * 6 = 36, and the value of 3 Wood is 3 * 8 = 24. So, the total value requested by Player 1 is 36 + 24 = 60.\n\n## Step 3: Determine if accepting Player 1's offer is beneficial.\nTo accept the offer, we give away 6 Wheat and 3 Wood, which totals to (6 * 6) + (3 * 8) = 36 + 24 = 60 in value. We receive 3 Sheep and 1 Ore, which totals to (3 * 14) + (1 * 33) = 42 + 33 = 75 in value. Since 75 > 60, accepting the offer is beneficial.\n\n## Step 4: Check if we have enough resources to fulfill Player 1's requested resources.\nWe have 21 Wheat and are requested to give 6, leaving us with 21 - 6 = 15 Wheat. We have 24 Wood and are requested to give 3, leaving us with 24 - 3 = 21 Wood. Both quantities are sufficient.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on the action based on the evaluation.\nSince accepting Player 1's offer increases our total value (from 60 to 75), we should accept the offer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Accept]}$",

      "response": "Since we've already accepted a trade offer from Player 1 in the previous turn and made the necessary transaction, let's assess the current state of resources and plan the next move.\n\nInitial resources:\n- Wheat: 21\n- Wood: 24\n- Sheep: 14\n- Brick: 11\n- Ore: 16\n\nAfter the accepted trade:\n- Gave: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood\n- Received: 3 Sheep, 1 Ore\n\nNew quantities:\n- Wheat: 21 - 6 = 15\n- Wood: 24 - 3 = 21\n- Sheep: 14 + 3 = 17\n- Brick: 11 (no change)\n- Ore: 16 + 1 = 17\n\nCurrent state:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 15   Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 21   Value: 8\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 17   Value: 14\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 11   Value: 20\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 17   Value: 33\n\nTo maximize the total value, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. \n\nLet's make a new offer that follows this principle. We can offer some Wheat and Wood (lower to moderate value) for Ore or Brick (higher value). However, we need to be cautious about the quantities and the other player's potential interests.\n\nConsidering the current state and the previous interactions, let's make an offer:\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (4*6) + (3*8) = 24 + 24 = 48, and receives resources worth (1*33) + (1*20) = 53, potentially increasing our total value.\n\nAction: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",
