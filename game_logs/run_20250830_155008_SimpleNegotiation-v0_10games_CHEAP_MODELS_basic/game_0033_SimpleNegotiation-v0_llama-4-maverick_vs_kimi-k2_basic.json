I have a lot of Ore (high value) and Sheep (relatively lower value compared to Ore and Brick). \n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of my Ore for resources that are either higher in value or for something I don't have a lot of but is valuable.\n\nTurn 1:\nI'll make an offer to see if I can get a better deal. Let's say I offer 2 Ore (Value: 2*33 = 66) for 2 Brick (Value: 2*27 = 54).

If not, I would consider other options like offering other resources or adjusting the quantity.\n\nLet's assume there's no response or the offer is denied (default), I will make another offer.\n\n'[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 2 Brick, 1 Wood]' is another possibility, trying to utilize my Sheep and Ore to get more Brick or other resources.\n\nHowever, I'll directly make a reasonable offer.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick]' \n\nLet's see the response. \n\nPlease provide the response or the next turn's details.",
