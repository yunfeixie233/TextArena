Since I already traded successfully by giving 8 Wheat + 6 Wood for 1 Ore + 2 Brick, I assume Player 1 still values cheap resources highly.\n\nSo the marginal exchange ratio appears near 5\u20137 combined Wheat/Wood per Ore.\n\nLet me offer a slightly cheaper bundle to entice another Ore.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
