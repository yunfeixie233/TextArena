      "response": "To make progress in the Negotiation Game, let's first assess the current situation and the resources available.\n\n1. **Current Resources and Their Total Value:**\n   - Wheat: 18 (Value: 5) = 18 * 5 = 90\n   - Wood: 20 (Value: 8) = 20 * 8 = 160\n   - Sheep: 14 (Value: 17) = 14 * 17 = 238\n   - Brick: 8 (Value: 27) = 8 * 27 = 216\n   - Ore: 11 (Value: 37) = 11 * 37 = 407\n   - Total Value = 90 + 160 + 238 + 216 + 407 = 1111\n\n2. **Previous Action and Outcome:**\n   - You (Player 1) made an offer to Player 0: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore.\n   - The total value of the offered resources is (5*5) + (2*8) = 25 + 16 = 41.\n   - The total value of the requested resource is 1*37 = 37.\n   - Player 0 rejected this offer.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Previous Offer:**\n   - The offer was not favorable for Player 0 since they were asked to give up resources worth 37 for resources worth 41. Although the difference isn't huge, it's still a loss for Player 0.\n   - The rejection indicates that Player 0 might not be willing to make a trade that they perceive as unfavorable.\n\n4. **New Offer Strategy:**\n   - To increase the total value of your resources, you need to make a trade that either gets you higher-value resources in exchange for lower-value ones or at least maintains a balance that Player 0 finds acceptable.\n   - Observing your resources, you have a surplus of Wheat and Wood, which are lower in value.\n   - You previously attempted to trade lower-value resources for Ore, which is high in value. However, the terms might not have been favorable for Player 0.\n\n5. **Proposed New Offer:**\n   - Let's propose a new trade that involves offering some Wheat and/or Wood (lower-value resources) for Brick or Sheep (moderately higher-value resources), as Ore seems too valuable for Player 0 to give away easily.\n   - For example, you could offer: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick.\n   - Calculation: \n     - Offered: (6*5) + (3*8) = 30 + 24 = 54.\n     - Requested: (1*17) + (1*27) = 17 + 27 = 44.\n   - This offer still doesn't favor Player 0 significantly, but it's closer in value.\n\n6. **Action:**\nGiven the situation and the objective to increase the total value, making a new offer with a better balance seems reasonable.\n\n'[Offer: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick]'",

We currently have: Wheat (18, Value: 5), Wood (20, Value: 8), Sheep (14, Value: 17), Brick (8, Value: 27), and Ore (11, Value: 37).\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the current resources and their total value\nCalculate the initial total value: (18*5) + (20*8) + (14*17) + (8*27) + (11*37) = 90 + 160 + 238 + 216 + 407 = 1111.\n\n## Step 3: Review the previous trade offers and their outcomes\nPrevious offers made by Player 1: \n1. [Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore] - Rejected.\n2. [Offer: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick] - Rejected.\n3. [Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore] - Rejected.\nAll offers were rejected by Player 0.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the rejected offers to understand what might be acceptable to Player 0\nThe rejected offers were for Ore and a combination of Sheep and Brick. It seems Player 0 is not willing to give up Ore easily or trade for the resources offered.\n\n## Step 5: Consider alternative trade offers that could be beneficial\nTo increase our total value, we need to think about what we can offer that might be more appealing to Player 0 and what we can request in return that would be valuable.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the value of resources we can offer versus what we can request\nWe have made offers involving Wheat and Wood for Ore. Let's consider offering resources that are less valuable to us for resources that are more valuable.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a new trade offer based on the analysis\nLet's think about offering Sheep (Value: 17) or Brick (Value: 27) for Ore (Value: 37), as Ore is the most valuable resource. However, we need to consider what Player 0 might be willing to give.\n\n## Step 8: Consider a new offer\nOne potential offer is to give something valuable but less so than Ore. For example, offering Brick for Ore: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]. Here, we're giving up a resource worth 27 for one worth 37, which increases our total value.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the potential gain of the new offer\nIf we offer 1 Brick (Value: 27) for 1 Ore (Value: 37), we gain 37 - 27 = 10 in value.\n\n## Step 10: Decide on the new trade offer\nThe new offer to be made is: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore].\n\n## Step 11: Provide the trade offer in the required format\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",

However, since Ore is the highest value and my offers for it were rejected, I should consider the value and quantity of the resources I'm offering.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the resources I have and their values to make a reasonable offer\nSince I have a significant amount of Wheat and Wood, and my previous offers to get Ore were rejected, let's think about offering some Sheep (Value: 17) or Brick (Value: 27) for Ore or other valuable resources.\n\n## Step 9: Propose a new trade offer\nLet's offer 3 Sheep (Value: 17 * 3 = 51) for 1 Ore (Value: 37).
