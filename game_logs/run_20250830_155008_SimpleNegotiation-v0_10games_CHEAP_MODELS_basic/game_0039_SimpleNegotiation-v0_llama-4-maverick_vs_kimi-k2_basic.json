      "response": "### Initial Analysis\nTo maximize the total value of my resources, I need to understand the current distribution and value of the resources I hold.\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty = 6, Value = 5\n- **[Wood]**: Qty = 7, Value = 8\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty = 17, Value = 13\n- **[Brick]**: Qty = 17, Value = 23\n- **[Ore]**: Qty = 9, Value = 33\n\nTotal value = (6 * 5) + (7 * 8) + (17 * 13) + (17 * 23) + (9 * 33) = 30 + 56 + 221 + 391 + 297 = 995\n\n### Strategy\nMy goal is to increase the total value by making trades. To do so, I should try to:\n1. Get resources with higher values if possible.\n2. Give away resources with lower values.\n\n### Turn 1 Action\nLet's analyze potential trades. I notice that Ore has the highest value (33), and I have a decent amount (9). Wheat has the lowest value (5), and I have 6 units of it. It might be beneficial to trade Wheat for something of higher value.\n\n### Trade Offer\nI'll start by offering Wheat, which is of lower value, in exchange for resources of higher or comparable value. Let's say I'll offer 4 Wheat (Value = 4 * 5 = 20) for something slightly higher or comparable in total value.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' is a potential trade because 1 Ore = 33, which is higher in value than 4 Wheat. However, it's a significant jump, so the opponent might not accept.\n\nLet's make a more balanced initial offer: '[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nHere, I'm offering (4 * 5) + (1 * 8) = 20 + 8 = 28 in value for 1 Ore (Value = 33). This seems like a reasonable starting point.\n\n### Action\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]'",

      "response": "### Negotiation Game Analysis\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 6    Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 7    Value: 8\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 14   Value: 13 (17 - 3)\n- [Brick]   Qty: 17   Value: 23\n- [Ore]     Qty: 10   Value: 33 (9 + 1)\n\n#### Previous Offers and Outcomes:\n1. Offered 4 Wheat for 1 Ore: **Rejected**\n2. Offered 3 Sheep for 1 Ore: **Accepted**\n3. Offered 4 Wheat for 1 Ore: **Rejected**\n4. Offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore: **Rejected**\n5. Offered 5 Wood for 1 Ore: **Rejected**\n\n#### Analysis:\n- The opponent accepted the offer of 3 Sheep for 1 Ore but rejected other offers involving different resources or quantities.\n- The value of Ore (33) is significantly higher than Sheep (13), making the accepted trade beneficial.\n- Attempts to trade Wheat or Wood for Ore were rejected, indicating either the opponent does not need Wheat or Wood or is not willing to trade Ore for them.\n\n#### Next Steps:\nGiven the history, we need to consider what resource to offer for Ore that the opponent might find acceptable. Since the opponent accepted 3 Sheep for 1 Ore, Sheep is a viable resource to trade. However, we should also consider the value and quantity of resources we have.\n\n#### New Offer:\nWe have used some Sheep in the previous trade. Let's consider other resources or adjust the quantity.\n\n- Offering Brick for Ore could be considered because we have a significant quantity of Brick, and its value is relatively high.\n\nLet's make a new offer: **[Offer: 4 Brick -> 1 Ore]**\n\n#### Rationale:\n- We have a substantial quantity of Brick (17), and giving away 4 still leaves us with 13.\n- The value of 4 Brick is 4 * 23 = 92, and 1 Ore is valued at 33. This trade might not be favorable in terms of value, but it's worth testing the opponent's willingness to trade Ore.\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.\n\n### Action:\n[Offer: 4 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
