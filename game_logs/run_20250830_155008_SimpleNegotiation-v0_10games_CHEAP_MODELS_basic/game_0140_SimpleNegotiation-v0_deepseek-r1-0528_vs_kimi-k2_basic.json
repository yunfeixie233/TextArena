      "response": "After reviewing the trade history and considering my current resources and values, I conclude that accepting your offer of 5 Sheep for 2 Ore would not increase my total resource value\u2014it results in an equal exchange (70 value each). While I'm open to mutually beneficial trades, this one doesn't advance my goal. However, I notice you've engaged in brick trades before, and I'm prepared to make a counter-proposal that builds on our prior successful exchange. \n\nI propose a repeat of our earlier trade structure but with a slight increase: I offer 2 Brick for 9 Sheep. This is based on my valuation (2 Brick = 54 value, 9 Sheep = 126 value), ensuring I gain significant value. For you, it mirrors our previous deal where you traded Sheep for Brick, albeit now at a higher but still reasonable rate.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 9 Sheep]",
