Assess the value of your current resources:\n   - Wheat: 21 * 6 = 126\n   - Wood: 19 * 9 = 171\n   - Sheep: 21 * 17 = 357\n   - Brick: 12 * 27 = 324\n   - Ore: 16 * 34 = 544\n   - **Total Value = 126 + 171 + 357 + 324 + 544 = 1522**\n\n2. Identify which resources you can trade for maximum value:\n   - Brick and Ore have relatively high values, and you have sufficient quantities of them.\n\n3. Propose trades that will optimize your position:\n   - Consider offering combinations of your resources that provide a good exchange rate for higher value resources.\n\n### Trading Offers:\n- **Turn 1 Offer**: \n   - [Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]\n   - Reasoning: You have a surplus of Sheep and Ore, while Brick can enhance your resource construction capability.\n\n### Proposed Action:\n- **Turn 1**: \n   - `\"[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]\"`\n\nYou can adjust your offers based on the opponent's responses and maintain a flexible negotiation stance. Keep track of what you obtain and aim to enhance your total value efficiently with each round.",
