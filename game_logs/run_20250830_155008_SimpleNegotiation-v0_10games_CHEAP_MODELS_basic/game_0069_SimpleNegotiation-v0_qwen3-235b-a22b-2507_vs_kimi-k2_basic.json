      "response": "Alright, let's break this down. I'm Player 1, and I've had a couple of turns with Player 0. Here's where we stand:\n\n**Current Resources and Values:**\n- Wheat: 19 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 12 (Value: 12)\n- Sheep: 14 (Value: 14)\n- Brick: 13 (Value: 21)\n- Ore: 24 (Value: 38)\n\n**Previous Offers:**\n1. Player 0 offered 10 Brick for my 5 Wheat and 3 Wood. I rejected it.\n2. I offered 5 Wheat and 3 Wood for 10 Brick. Player 0 rejected it.\n\n**Value Analysis:**\nLet's calculate the value of the proposed trades to see if they were fair or not.\n\n- **Player 0's Offer:** They want to give 10 Brick (value: 10 * 21 = 210) and take 5 Wheat (5 * 5 = 25) and 3 Wood (3 * 12 = 36). Total they're giving: 210, taking: 61. This is heavily in my favor, but they rejected my counter-offer which suggests they might not value Brick as high as I do.\n\n- **My Counter-Offer:** I offered to give 5 Wheat (25) and 3 Wood (36) for 10 Brick (210). Total I'm giving: 61, taking: 210. Same as above, but reversed. They rejected this.\n\nThis implies that Player 0 might not value Brick as much as I do, or they have a surplus of Brick and are trying to offload it for less valuable resources.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nSince both sides have rejected the direct swap, maybe a different approach is needed. Perhaps Player 0 is looking for a different combination of resources or more balanced trade.\n\nGiven that Sheep is my highest value per unit (14), and I have 14 Sheep, maybe I can leverage that. Brick is also valuable to me (21 per unit), but I have enough (13), so acquiring more might not be urgent unless it's at a good rate.\n\nLet me think of a new offer that might appeal to Player 0. Maybe offering some Ore or Sheep since they seem to have rejected the Wheat/Wood for Brick deal.\n\n**New Offer Consideration:**\nPlayer 0 seems to want Wheat and Wood but is unwilling to give up Brick at the rate I proposed. Maybe they value Brick higher than 21 (per my valuation), or they want more for it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they need Ore or Sheep. I have a good amount of both. \n\nLet me propose a trade that gives them more value per resource they're giving up. For example, if they're willing to trade Brick for a mix of resources, maybe I can offer more Wheat/Wood or even some Sheep/Ore.\n\n**Potential New Offer:**\nHow about I offer some Ore (higher value) for Brick? \n\nFor instance:\n- I could offer 3 Ore (3 * 38 = 114) for 5 Brick (5 * 21 = 105). This gives them slightly more value (114 vs 105), but it's close.\n\nOr, since Brick is valuable to me, maybe I want more Brick for the Ore.\n\nAlternatively, maybe offer some Sheep and Wood:\n\nLet's say I offer 4 Wood (4 * 12 = 48) and 2 Sheep (2 * 14 = 28) for 5 Brick (5 * 21 = 105). Giving them 76 for 105 - this might not be appealing.\n\nWait, maybe Player 0 is looking for a better ratio. Given they rejected 61 for 210, they might expect me to give up more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they're low on Wheat and Wood specifically, and Brick is scarce for them.\n\n**Re-evaluate:**\nGiven both initial offers were rejected, maybe the issue is the quantity. Maybe 5 Wheat and 3 Wood is too much for Player 0 to give up 10 Brick, or vice versa.\n\nPerhaps a smaller trade:\n\nI could offer 2 Wheat (10) and 2 Wood (24) for 4 Brick (84). This is giving 34 for 84 - still in their favor.\n\nBut this might not be enough.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe Player 0 wants Ore or Sheep more. Let me try offering Ore for Brick at a better rate for them.\n\nFor example:\nOffer 3 Ore (114) for 4 Brick (84). This is giving them 114 for 84 - a 30 point gain for them. Maybe they'll accept this.\n\n**Final New Offer:**\nI think offering Ore for Brick is the way to go, since Ore is my highest value per unit, and they might value Brick less.\n\nI'll make this offer:\n[Offer: 3 Ore -> 5 Brick]\n\nWait, 3 Ore (114) for 5 Brick (105). This is 114 > 105, giving them slightly more value. This seems fair.\n\n**Decision:**\nI'll proceed with this offer as it seems balanced and might appeal to Player 0.\n\n[Offer: 3 Ore -> 5 Brick]",

      "response": "Let\u2019s assess what\u2019s happened and make our best possible move on this turn.\n\n1.  Examine our value-dominant choices  \n    Brick gives us 21 value apiece, Ore 38.  \n    We are overweighted in Ore (24 units) and a bit lean on Brick (13), so the ideal is to keep converting excess Ore into more Brick.\n\n2.  Understand the negotiation so far  \n    \u2022 P0 values Brick enough that it turned down 4 Ore (152 value) for 5 Brick (105 value).  \n    \u2022 P0 has offered to receive 5 Wheat (25) + 3 Wood (36) for 10 Brick (210).  \n    These signals suggest P0 over-values Brick, under-values Ore and is unsure about Sheep.  \n    We must therefore edge closer to what P0 perceives as acceptable for Brick.\n\n3.  Pricing analysis of a new pitch  \n    Three earlier rebuffed Ore-for-Brick ranges have been:  \n    \u2022 3 Ore (114 value) : 5 Brick (105) \u2013 failed  \n    \u2022 4 Ore (152) : 5 Brick (105) \u2013 failed  \n    That means 4 Ore is not attractive enough.  Adding something tiny but not critical can tilt the balance.  \n    We have 14 Sheep (value 14 per unit) and it is the least-useful good to us when we\u2019re trying to max total value later.  Dropping one Sheep bumps the bundle offered from 152 to 166 while only costing us 14.\n\n4.  Construct the new offer  \n   Offer 5 Ore (5 \u00d7 38 = 190) + 1 Sheep (14) for 6 Brick (6 \u00d7 21 = 126).  That gives P0 a raw value surplus (+78) without venturing anywhere near the steep 2:1 level our earlier counters showed.  The physical ratio 5\u00bd Ore-equiv : 1 Wood-ish is more tempting than the previous 3.8 Ore-equiv : 1 Brick.\n\n5.  Check our own gain  \n   We expend 190 + 14 = 204 in value but gain 6 \u00d7 21 = 126 in Brick. While on paper we are value-negative, we\u2019re turning moderate-value Ore into rare high-scaled Brick, and still keeping 19 Ore (plenty for any future needs).  More importantly, a deal puts extra total points under our control; holding out risks getting 0 improvement.\n\nHence, our negotiation move:\n\n[Offer: 5 Ore, 1 Sheep -> 6 Brick]",
