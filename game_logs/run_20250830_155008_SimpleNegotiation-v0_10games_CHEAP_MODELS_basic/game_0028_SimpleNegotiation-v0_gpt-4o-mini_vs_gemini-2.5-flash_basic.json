      "response": "It seems that Player 0 is interested in trading Brick. Let's analyze the current offer: Offered items: 4 Sheep (value 13 each, total 52), 2 Wood (value 8 each, total 16) -> Requested items: 5 Brick (value 27 each, total 135). The total value offered is 68, and the total value requested is 135. This is not a good deal for me.\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I have a lot of Sheep, Wood, and Ore, and a decent amount of Brick. I might consider trading some of my high-value Ore for some higher-valued resources, but right now I need to counter Player 0's offer to get a better deal for my Brick.\n\nSince Player 0 seems interested in Brick, I should try to get more for them. I have enough Brick to trade. I will try to offer fewer of my resources in exchange for the 5 Brick. Let's try to offer something with a total value closer to 135.\n\nI will try to offer a mix of Sheep and Wood, but a smaller quantity or offer some Ore.\n\nLet's try to offer 4 Sheep (value 52) and 2 Ore (value 66) for 5 Brick (value 135). That's 118 value offered for 135 value requested. This is much closer to a good deal for me. It's still a slight loss for me in terms of raw value, but perhaps strategic for a larger amount or better for future trades.\n\nHowever, Player 0 has a lot of Wheat and Wood. So offering Wood might be less attractive.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Player 0 has offered 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 5 Brick. The value of this offer for Player 0 is: (4 * 13) + (2 * 8) = 52 + 16 = 68. The value of 5 Brick for Player 0 is 5 * 27 = 135. So Player 0 is trying to get 135 value for 68 value. This is a very bad deal for me.\n\nI want to increase my total value. I have plenty of Sheep, Wood, Ore, and Brick. I still have 14 Sheep, 22 Wood, 11 Brick, 22 Ore, and 5 Wheat.\n\nSince Player 0 is asking for 5 Brick (value 135), I want to ask for something significantly higher in value, or give up less valuable goods.\n\nPerhaps I can offer items that I have in abundance for Brick.\n\nLet's use the provided template: '[Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]'\n\nLet's offer something that makes sense. I have a lot of Sheep and Ore. Let's try to offer a good amount of my Sheep for the Brick.\n\nHow about offering 5 Sheep, 2 Ore for 5 Brick?\n5 Sheep (5 * 13 = 65) + 2 Ore (2 * 33 = 66) = 131.\n5 Brick (5 * 27 = 135). This is 131 for 135, which is almost a fair trade. I could consider this.\n\nWhat if I counter with a different amount of Brick in exchange for fewer of my resources?\nPlayer 0 offered: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 5 Brick (Value: 68 -> 135)\n\nI should try to get more value out of my Brick. If Player 0 wants 5 Brick, I need to get at least 135 value back.\n\nWhat if I offer 16 Sheep for 5 Brick? (16 * 13 = 208). This is too much.\n\nLet's consider what Player 0 has a lot of. Player 0 previously offered 5 Wheat, 5 Wood. Maybe they have a lot of Wheat and Wood.\n\nI have 11 Brick, so I can definitely offer some Brick.\n\nLet's try to make a trade where I gain value.\n\nIf Player 0 gives me 5 Brick (value 135), I need to give them something with less than 135 value.\n\nRe-evaluate - Player 0 made an offer. I need to respond to it.\nThe current offer from Player 0 is: Offered items: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 5 Brick.\nI will respond with a counter offer.\n\nMy counter-offer: I will offer a better deal for myself, where I give up less value for the 5 Brick.\n\nLet's try:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick]\nValue Offered: 3 Sheep (3 * 13 = 39) + 2 Ore (2 * 33 = 66) = 105\nValue Requested (5 Brick): 5 * 27 = 135\nThis means I am offering 105 value for 135 value, which is a gain of 30 value for me.
