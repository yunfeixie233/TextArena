Total given up = 45 + 64 = 109.\n- I receive: 4 Brick (4*22 = 88), 2 Wood (2*9 = 18). Total received = 88 + 18 = 106.\nSince 106 (received) < 109 (given up), this trade is not beneficial.\n\n## Step 4: Consider making a new trade offer\nGiven that my last offer was rejected and considering my current resources, I need to think about a new trade that could be beneficial.\nLet's examine potential trades that could increase my total value.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze potential trades\nOne potential trade could involve offering resources of lower value for resources of higher value.\n- Offering Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 9) for Ore (Value: 32) could be beneficial.\n- My current quantities are: Wheat = 14, Wood = 8, Ore = 15.\n\n## Step 6: Formulate a new trade offer\nLet's formulate a trade offer based on the analysis.\nOffering 5 Wheat (5*5 = 25) for 1 Ore (1*32 = 32) could be a good deal because 32 > 25.\nThus, a potential offer could be: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore].\n\n## Step 7: Check if the formulated trade is within the resource limits\nI have 14 Wheat and 15 Ore, so offering 5 Wheat for 1 Ore is within my limits.\n\n## Step 8: Decide on the action for this turn\nGiven the analysis, I will make a new trade offer: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore].\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]}$",
