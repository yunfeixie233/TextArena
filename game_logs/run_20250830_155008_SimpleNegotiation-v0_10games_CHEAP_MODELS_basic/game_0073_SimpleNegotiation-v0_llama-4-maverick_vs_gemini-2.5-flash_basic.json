      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, I will analyze my current resources and their values to determine the best course of action.\n\n**Current Resources and Values:**\n\n1. Wheat - Quantity: 8, Value: 6\n2. Wood - Quantity: 19, Value: 9\n3. Sheep - Quantity: 12, Value: 12\n4. Brick - Quantity: 16, Value: 25\n5. Ore - Quantity: 23, Value: 40\n\n**Total Current Value:**  \nTo simplify, let's calculate the total value of my resources.  \n- Wheat: 8 * 6 = 48  \n- Wood: 19 * 9 = 171  \n- Sheep: 12 * 12 = 144  \n- Brick: 16 * 25 = 400  \n- Ore: 23 * 40 = 920  \n**Total Value = 48 + 171 + 144 + 400 + 920 = 1683**\n\n### Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I need to make trades that are beneficial. This involves either getting resources of higher value or increasing the quantity of resources that are already of high value.\n\n1. **Identify High-Value Resources:** Ore (Value: 40) and Brick (Value: 25) are my highest value resources. I already have a significant quantity of these, so maintaining or slightly increasing them could be beneficial.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Trades:** I should look to trade resources that are of lower value for those that are of higher value or that I can negotiate for a quantity that increases my total value.\n\n### First Turn Action\n\nFor my first turn, I will make an offer that attempts to leverage my lower-value resources for higher-value ones or at least maintains my current high-value resource quantities.\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (low value) and Wood (relatively low value) for Brick or Ore, as they are high-value resources.\n\n**Offer:** `[Offer: 5 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis offer reduces my lower-value resources slightly while attempting to gain more of the highest-value resource (Ore). The logic is that 5 Wood (Value: 45) and 4 Wheat (Value: 24) total a value of 69, which is less than the value of 1 Ore (Value: 40), but since I have plenty of Wood and Wheat, and I am trying to increase my total value, I am willing to part with some. However, I made a mistake in calculation here; I should directly aim to make a reasonable trade that doesn't directly show a loss but rather a strategic move.\n\nLet's directly analyze the offer:  \n- I'm offering 5 Wood and 4 Wheat.  \n- I'm asking for 1 Ore.\n\nThe total value offered is (5*9) + (4*6) = 45 + 24 = 69.  \nThe value requested is 1*40 = 40.  \nWhile it seems like I'm potentially losing value (69 offered for 40), the goal is to negotiate and potentially start a conversation that could lead to a more beneficial trade in the future or accept a counteroffer that's beneficial.\n\nHowever, re-evaluating for a potentially more strategic first move, I might consider a different trade.\n\n### Alternative First Turn Action\n\nUpon further consideration, a more balanced or less risky initial offer could involve trading resources of similar values or making an offer that is more likely to be accepted.\n\nLet's directly go with the initial offer due to the format requirement and adjust based on the response.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`",

I will try to be more flexible, maybe try to get a better rate for my Brick, or offer more Brick for the Ore.\n\nLet's try to offer a similar deal, but slightly different numbers.\nI will offer 1 Brick but ask for some additional resource in return, or offer 2 Brick for 3 Ore.\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources.\n\nLet's stick to the previous offer, which seems reasonable from my perspective, as my Brick is quite abundant.\nPrevious offer was 1 Brick -> 2 Ore. Value comparison: 30 -> 64. This is a very good deal for me.\nThe opponent rejected it.\n\nLet's try to be less greedy. Maybe 1 Brick for 1 Ore. That's 30 -> 32, a slight gain for me.\nOr 2 Brick for 3 Ore (60 -> 96). Still good.\n\nI need to get better deals. I have an abundance of Brick.\nI will offer 1 Brick for 2 Ore again, as it's a very good deal for me.\nIt seems the opponent is not interested in giving away 2 Ore for 1 Brick.\n\nLet's consider the opponent's offers. They often offer low-value resources for my high-value ones.\nTheir current offer (4 Wheat for 1 Ore) is bad.\n\nLet's try to target the opponent's desire for Ore.\nI have 24 Ore. I can part with some if the deal is good.\n\nI will try to make an offer that is less lopsided in my favor but still beneficial.\nHow about 1 Brick for 1 Ore? Value: 30 -> 32. It's a small gain for me.\nThe opponent seems to value Ore highly.\n\nI'm focused on increasing my net worth.\n\nLet's try to offer 2 Brick for 3 Ore. This is 60 value for 96 value. It's a 36 value increase for me. This is still a good deal for me and might entice the opponent.\n\nThinking about the opponent's offers:\n- 5 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore (60+20 -> 32) (Bad for opponent)\n- 6 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore (72+34 -> 32) (Bad for opponent)\n- 4 Ore -> 1 Brick (128 -> 30) (Very bad for opponent)\n\nThe opponent's offers seem to indicate they are desperate for Brick or valuing Ore very lowly when trading it away, and valuing it highly when requesting it. And they consistently overvalue their own resources while undervaluing mine.\n\nGiven their previous offers, they might be willing to pay a high price for Brick.\nI have a lot of Brick (23).\n\nHow about offering 1 Brick and 1 Wheat for 1 Ore? (30 + 5 = 35 -> 32). This is a loss for me. No.\n\nI need to maximize value.\nI will stick to my strategy of trading Brick for Ore because I have a lot of Brick, and Ore is more valuable.\n\nLet's increase the quantity of what I'm offering to sweeten the deal, but ensure I still gain value.\nOffer: 2 Brick -> 3 Ore.\nMy value: 2 * 30 = 60\nRequested value: 3 * 32 = 96\nNet gain: 36\n\nThis seems like a fair offer for me.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 3 Ore]",

Player 0 offered: 5 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore (Rejected)\n2. Player 0 offered: 6 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore (Rejected)\n3. Player 0 offered: 4 Ore -> 1 Brick (Rejected)\n4. Player 1 offered: 1 Brick -> 2 Ore (Rejected by Player 0)\n5. The same offers in steps 3 and 4 were repeated and rejected.\n\nLatest Offer from Player 1: \n- Offered: 2 Brick -> Requested: 3 Ore\n\nLet's evaluate this offer:\n- Giving up 3 Ore (Value: 3*40 = 120)\n- Receiving 2 Brick (Value: 2*25 = 50)\n\nThis trade is not favorable as it results in a net loss of value (120 - 50 = 70).\n\nConsidering the goal is to increase the total value of resources, we need to think about what we can offer that might be acceptable to both parties.\n\nCurrent Total Value = (8*6) + (19*9) + (12*12) + (16*25) + (23*40)\n= 48 + 171 + 144 + 400 + 920\n= 1683\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. We have a lot of Ore, so offering Ore for other resources might be a good strategy if we can get a good deal.\n2. We have tried offering Ore for Brick before, but it was rejected.\n\nLet's consider an alternative:\n- We could offer some Wood or Sheep for Ore since Ore has a high value.\n\nBefore making a new offer, let's check if accepting the current offer from Player 1 is viable or if we should make a counteroffer.\n\nSince the last offer from Player 1 is not in our favor, we should try to negotiate a better deal.\n\nLet's propose a new offer:\n- We need Ore, and Player 1 seems to want Ore. We've tried offering Wood and Sheep for Ore before without success.\n\nAn alternative could be to offer something we have in abundance relative to its value for something more valuable.\n\nFor example, offering Wheat (lower value) or some Wood for Ore could be considered.\n\nLet's make a new offer: \n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis translates to: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe action in the required format is:\n[Offer: 5 Wheat,  -> 1 Ore] \n\nCorrected to follow the exact format specified:\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
