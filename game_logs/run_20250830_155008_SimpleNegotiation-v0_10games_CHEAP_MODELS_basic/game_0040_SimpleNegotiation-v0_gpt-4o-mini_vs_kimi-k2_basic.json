      "response": "Player 0 has faced repeated rejections from Player 1 for various trade offers. It's essential to either rethink the strategy or adjust the trade offers to make them more appealing to Player 1. \n\nGiven the resources and quantities available, it might be beneficial to focus on finding a balance that maximizes value while minimizing the quantity of resources offered. \n\nLet\u2019s analyze the current resources once again:\n\n- **Wheat**: 19 Qty, Value: 6\n- **Wood**: 22 Qty, Value: 12\n- **Sheep**: 19 Qty, Value: 17\n- **Brick**: 23 Qty, Value: 28\n- **Ore**: 21 Qty, Value: 35\n\nConsidering the values of Brick and Ore are particularly high, it might be beneficial to propose trades that involve these resources. \n\n### New Trade Offer Proposal:\nI will offer:\n- 3 Wood\n- 2 Wheat \n\nTo request:\n- 5 Brick\n- 1 Ore\n\nThis combination leverages a fair quantity of lower-value resources for higher-value resources that can enhance my overall strategy. \n\n**Trade Offer:**\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 5 Brick, 1 Ore]",
