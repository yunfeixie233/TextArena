However, we should be cautious about giving away too much valuable material.\n\nLet's make an offer:\n- We can offer 4 Wheat (4 * 6 = 24) and 2 Wood (2 * 10 = 20), totaling 44 in value.\n- We could ask for 1 Ore (1 * 35 = 35) or something else of similar or greater value.\n\nA potential offer: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nResponse: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

Our lowest value resources are Wheat (Value: 6) and Wood (Value: 10). We could offer these to gain higher value resources like Ore (Value: 35) or even Brick (Value: 20) or Sheep (Value: 17) if possible.\n\n2. **Assessing Player 0's Likely Interests**: Since our previous offers were rejected, we need to consider what Player 0 might be interested in. Given that our offers for Ore in exchange for Brick were rejected, it might indicate that Player 0 is not interested in Ore or has enough Brick.\n\n### New Offer\n\nLet's propose a new offer that involves resources we have in abundance and are of lower value, in exchange for resources that are of higher value.\n\n- We have a significant amount of Wheat and Wood. Let's offer some of these for a resource that could potentially increase our total value.\n\n### Proposal\n\nLet's make the following offer:\n- Offered items: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> Requested items: 2 Ore\n\nThis offer involves giving away resources of total value (6*6) + (4*10) = 36 + 40 = 76, in exchange for resources of total value 2*35 = 70. While this isn't a great deal value-wise, it's worth considering if Player 0 is interested in Wheat and Wood.\n\nHowever, upon reevaluation, this deal doesn't seem beneficial. Let's think of another option.\n\n### Alternative Proposal\n\nLet's consider:\n- Offered items: 3 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n\nThis involves giving away resources of total value 3*17 = 51, in exchange for resources of total value 1*35 = 35. Again, not a great deal.\n\nLet's directly propose a better deal.\n\n### Better Proposal\n\n- [Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
