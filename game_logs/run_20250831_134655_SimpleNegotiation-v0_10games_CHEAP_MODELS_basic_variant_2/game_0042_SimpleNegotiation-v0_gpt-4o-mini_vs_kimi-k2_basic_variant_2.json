      "response": "Based on the trading activity so far, it appears that both players are having difficulty reaching an agreement. Player 1 has offered resources that do not seem to meet the needs of Player 0, leading to rejected offers. \n\nConsidering the current situation, Player 0 needs to reassess the next move strategically. Here\u2019s a proposed action:\n\n1. Assess available resources:\n   - Wheat: 19  \n   - Wood: 13  \n   - Sheep: 23  \n   - Brick: 20  \n   - Ore: 20  \n\n2. Player 1 offered previously and seems to be trying to get either Ore or Brick in exchange for Wheat and Sheep. Player 0 currently has a surplus of Wood and Sheep and can negotiate effectively.\n\n3. Let's make a new offer:\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 4 Ore, 2 Brick]\n\nThis new offer not only maintains the exchange of Sheep and Wood but also requests resources that Player 0 values for further trades. This could entice Player 1 to accept, especially if they have a need for Sheep or Wood. \n\nLet\u2019s proceed with that offer.",
