      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first assess the current state of resources after the trades made.\n\nInitially:\n- Wheat: 8, Value: 5\n- Wood: 17, Value: 11\n- Sheep: 6, Value: 12\n- Brick: 19, Value: 24\n- Ore: 13, Value: 36\n\nAfter the first trade (4 Brick -> 4 Wheat):\n- Wheat: 8 - 4 = 4, then +4 = 12\n- Wood: 17\n- Sheep: 6\n- Brick: 19 - 4 = 15\n- Ore: 13\n\nSo, after the first trade: \n- Wheat: 12\n- Wood: 17\n- Sheep: 6\n- Brick: 15\n- Ore: 13\n\nAfter the second trade (4 Wood -> 1 Ore):\n- Wheat: 12\n- Wood: 17 - 4 = 13\n- Sheep: 6\n- Brick: 15\n- Ore: 13 + 1 = 14\n\nCurrent State:\n- Wheat: 12, Value: 5\n- Wood: 13, Value: 11\n- Sheep: 6, Value: 12\n- Brick: 15, Value: 24\n- Ore: 14, Value: 36\n\nLet's calculate the total value:\nTotal Value = (12*5) + (13*11) + (6*12) + (15*24) + (14*36)\nTotal Value = 60 + 143 + 72 + 360 + 504\nTotal Value = 1139\n\nTo maximize the total value, we should look for trades that increase it. The last offer made was rejected, and it was for 2 Wood and 1 Sheep for 1 Ore. Let's analyze if it was a good trade:\n- Giving up: 2 Wood (2*11 = 22) and 1 Sheep (1*12 = 12), Total = 34\n- Getting: 1 Ore (1*36 = 36)\nSince 36 > 34, it was a slightly beneficial trade. However, it was rejected.\n\nLet's consider making a new offer. We have:\n- High-value items: Ore (36), Brick (24)\n- Mid-value items: Sheep (12), Wood (11)\n- Low-value items: Wheat (5)\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some of our lower-value or mid-value items for higher-value ones or maintaining a good balance.\n\nOne idea is to trade some Wheat or Wood for Ore or Sheep, but we've just gotten Ore for Wood, so let's think about other combinations.\n\nLet's directly propose a trade that could be beneficial:\n- Offering: 2 Wheat (2*5 = 10) and 1 Brick (1*24 = 24), Total = 34\n- Requesting: 1 Ore (1*36 = 36)\n\nThis trade involves giving up resources worth 34 for something worth 36, which is beneficial.\n\nSo, a potential offer is: [Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
