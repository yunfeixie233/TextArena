Do you want to propose a new trade that increases your total value?\n\nIt looks like the game state description in your prompt has some conflicting information.\nSpecifically:\n\"Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\"\n\"Player 1 made no new trade offer.\"\n\"Player 0 made no new trade offer.\"\n\nAnd then immediately asks:\n\"The previous offer was from Player 0: Offered items: 5 Brick, 3 Sheep -> Requested items: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood, 1 Ore.\nYou accepted this offer previously.\"\n\nThis implies the trade already happened. If the trade already happened, your resources should be updated, and then you would make a new offer.\n\nGiven the prompt's instruction to \"always follow the required format\" and the previous game log indicating acceptance, I will assume the trade *has* occurred and update your resources, and then you should make a new offer.\n\n**Updated Resources (after Player 1 accepted the trade):**\n\nYou *received*: 5 Brick, 3 Sheep\nYou *gave*: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood, 1 Ore\n\n*   **Wheat:** 14 - 5 = 9 (Value: 5)\n*   **Wood:** 22 - 2 = 20 (Value: 9)\n*   **Sheep:** 15 + 3 = 18 (Value: 17)\n*   **Brick:** 11 + 5 = 16 (Value: 23)\n*   **Ore:** 23 - 1 = 22 (Value: 34)\n\nNow, with your updated resources, what is your move? Remember, the goal is to increase the total value of your resources.\n\nCurrent total value:\n(9 * 5) + (20 * 9) + (18 * 17) + (16 * 23) + (22 * 34) = 45 + 180 + 306 + 368 + 748 = 1647\n\nThe previous total value was:\n(14 * 5) + (22 * 9) + (15 * 17) + (11 * 23) + (23 * 34) = 70 + 198 + 255 + 253 + 782 = 1558\n\nIndeed, your value has increased from 1558 to 1647 by accepting that trade. Good job!\n\nNow, make a new offer to further increase your value.\n\nIt is your turn.\n**Your Resources:**\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 9   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 20   Value: 9\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 18   Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 16   Value: 23\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 22   Value: 34\n\nWhat is your move?\n[Offer: your offer] or [Accept] or [Deny] (There is no outstanding offer to accept/deny from Player 0 from previous turn).\n**Offer Format:** `[Offer: Qty Resource, Qty Resource -> Qty Resource, Qty Resource]`",
