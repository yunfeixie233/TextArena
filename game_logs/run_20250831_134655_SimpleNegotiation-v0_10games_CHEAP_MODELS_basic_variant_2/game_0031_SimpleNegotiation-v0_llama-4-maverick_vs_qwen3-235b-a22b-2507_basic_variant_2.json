      "response": "### Negotiation Game Initial Assessment\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n\n1. **Wheat**: Qty: 17, Value: 5\n2. **Wood**: Qty: 22, Value: 8\n3. **Sheep**: Qty: 22, Value: 17\n4. **Brick**: Qty: 10, Value: 29\n5. **Ore**: Qty: 6, Value: 35\n\n#### Initial Total Value:\nTo understand the starting point, let's calculate the total value of the resources:\n- Wheat: 17 * 5 = 85\n- Wood: 22 * 8 = 176\n- Sheep: 22 * 17 = 374\n- Brick: 10 * 29 = 290\n- Ore: 6 * 35 = 210\n- Total Value = 85 + 176 + 374 + 290 + 210 = 1135\n\n#### Strategy:\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources through trades. We should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or at least maintain the value while gaining quantity if possible.\n\n#### Initial Offer:\nLet's analyze the resources and their values:\n- The highest value resource is Ore (Value: 35), followed by Brick (Value: 29), then Sheep (Value: 17), Wood (Value: 8), and Wheat (Value: 5).\n- We have a relatively high quantity of Sheep and Wood.\n\nTo start, we can look to trade resources that are of lower value for higher value resources. One potential trade could involve offering some of our Wood (Value: 8) for Ore (Value: 35), as Ore is significantly more valuable.\n\nLet's propose a trade:\n'[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis translates to: '[Offer: 3 Wood, 0 Wheat, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wood, 0 Wheat, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 1 Ore]'\n\nThus, the offer in the required format is: '[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]'\n\n### Response:\n'[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]'",

      "response": "Since Player 1 accepted the trade offer of 5 Wheat for 1 Brick, let's first update the resources:\n\nInitially, Player 0 had:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 17   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 22   Value: 8\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 22   Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 10   Value: 29\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 6    Value: 35\n\nAfter the accepted trade (5 Wheat -> 1 Brick):\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 17 - 5 = 12   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 22         Value: 8\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 22         Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 10 + 1 = 11   Value: 29\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 6          Value: 35\n\nNew quantities and total value:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 12   Value: 60 (12*5)\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 22   Value: 176 (22*8)\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 22   Value: 374 (22*17)\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 11   Value: 319 (11*29)\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 6    Value: 210 (6*35)\nTotal value = 60 + 176 + 374 + 319 + 210 = 1139\n\nTo decide the next offer, let's analyze the current situation and the previous trades. The goal is to increase the total value of resources.\n\nPrevious offers for Ore were rejected, indicating that Player 1 might not have Ore to spare or is not willing to part with it easily. The last accepted trade was 5 Wheat for 1 Brick, which slightly increased the total value (since Brick's value is higher than Wheat's).\n\nLet's consider making a new offer. We still need to think about how to get more Ore or other high-value resources. \n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of the resources we have in abundance for Ore. Since offering Wood or Sheep for Ore was previously rejected, let's think about the value and quantity.\n\nConsidering the values:\n- Offering some Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 8) for Ore (Value: 35) might not be attractive if the quantity is not sufficient.\n- Sheep (Value: 17) is valuable, and offering a few for Ore could be considered.\n\nLet's make a new offer:\n'[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis is a relatively valuable offer compared to what we've offered before for Ore, and it includes Brick, which we gained in the last trade.\n\nAction: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
