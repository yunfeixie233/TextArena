      "response": "My resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 12   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 15   Value: 9\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 23   Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 18   Value: 20\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 14   Value: 32\n\nPlayer 0 rejected my last offer of 2 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Sheep. This means they likely don't value Sheep as highly as I thought, or they value Wheat/Wood more than I expected.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the previous successful trades. I was effectively trading (2*5 + 1*9) = 19 value for 1 Sheep (value 17). This was a loss-making trade for me, but Player 0 kept accepting it. I shouldn't repeat this. It seems Player 0 is happy to make deals where they profit. My goal is to increase my total value.\n\nSince Player 0 repeatedly accepted the bad offer for me, they clearly have an abundance of Sheep or value them less than me. Conversely, they seem to value Wheat and Wood highly. This gives me an opportunity. However, I need to make offers that are profitable for me.\n\nMy current strategy should be to:\n1. Prioritize trades that increase my total value.\n2. Exploit Player 0's apparent high valuation of Wheat/Wood and lower valuation of Sheep.\n3. Aim to trade low-value resources for high-value resources.\n\nLet's look at the resource values:\nWheat: 5\nWood: 9\nSheep: 17\nBrick: 20\nOre: 32\n\nI have a lot of Sheep (23) and more Brick (18) than Ore (14), Wood (15) or Wheat (12).\nI have the most Sheep, followed by Brick. The least are Wheat and Ore.\n\nI want to acquire more high-value resources (Ore, Brick, Sheep) by giving away low-value resources (Wheat, Wood, potentially Sheep if I can get something of much higher value).\n\nSince Player 0 rejected the last offer, they might not need more Sheep, or my offer wasn't appealing enough for what they were giving.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat/Wood for something higher value, since Player 0 valued them.\nMaybe they want more Wheat, and I have a decent amount (12).\n\nHow about trading a lower value item for a higher value item, aiming for a small profit for me?\n\nLet's try to get Brick or Ore.\n\nOption A: Trade Wheat for Ore/Brick.\nMy 1 Wheat (value 5) for 1/4 Ore (value 8) - Player 0 unlikely to swap like this.\nMy 1 Wheat for 1/3 Brick (value 6.6)\n\nWhat if I offer something more substantial?\nMy Wheat Qty: 12   Value: 5\nMy Wood Qty: 15   Value: 9\n\nPlayer 0 just rejected 2 Wheat (10) + 1 Wood (9) = 19 for 1 Sheep (17). My earlier trades where Player 0 accepted were net losses for me. I need to flip this around.\n\nLet's try to trade a larger quantity of my relatively lower-value items (Wheat, Wood) for a higher-value item. Since they rejected 1 Sheep, let's try for Brick or Ore.\n\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (15) and ask for 1 Brick (20), that's a small gain for me (5 value). It might be acceptable for Player 0 if they value Wheat highly.\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick] Value: 15 -> 20 (Gain 5)\n\nIf I offer 2 Wood (18) for 1 Brick (20), that's a gain of 2 for me.\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick] Value: 18 -> 20 (Gain 2)\n\nI have plenty of Wood. Let's try this. It's a small gain for me, might be easier for Player 0 to accept.\n\nAnother idea: Since I have a lot of Sheep, maybe I can trade some for a higher-value resource if Player 0 needs them AND is willing to give up something better. But Player 0 just rejected a deal involving Sheep, possibly meaning they have plenty themselves or don't value them highly.\n\nLet's try a simple offer that is profitable for me given resource values.\nPlayer 0 rejected a trade where I offered items worth 19 and asked for an item worth 17. They want to gain. So I must structure an offer where I gain and they also perceive a gain.\n\nGiven the history, Player 0 seems to desire Wheat and Wood.\nWhat if I offer Wheat and ask for Ore? Ore is the highest value.\nMy 2 Wheat (10) for 1 Ore (32). Unlikely.\nHow about I offer 1 Brick (Value 20) for 1 Ore (Value 32)? This is a good trade for me, gain of 12. Player 0 might accept if they need Brick.\n\nLet's stick with trading my lower value items (Wheat, Wood) for higher value items (Brick, Ore).\n\nI have 12 Wheat (value 5) and 15 Wood (value 9).\nI have 18 Brick (value 20) and 14 Ore (value 32).\n\nConsider an offer where I give 1 Wood (value 9) and request 1 Sheep (value 17). Good for me (+8 value). Player 0 might accept if they want Wood and are happy to give away Sheep.\n\nLet's try a small, profitable trade for me.\nI will offer 1 Wood (value 9) and 1 Wheat (value 5) = 14 and ask for 1 Sheep (value 17).\nThis is a gain of 3 for me, and Player 0 gets items with a combined value of 14 for their 17-value item. This is a small loss for Player 0 in pure value, but if they value Wheat/Wood highly due to their needs, they might accept. This is the reverse of my previously accepted (unprofitable) trades.\n\nI need to aim for scenarios where I gain value.\n\nLet's offer a combination of lower value resources for a higher value resource.\nI have a lot of Sheep. It might be good to convert them to Ore or Brick. But Player 0 rejected Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nOffer: 2 Wood (18) for 1 Ore (32). Gain: 14. This is a significant gain. This might seem too good to be true for me. Player 0 would lose 14 value. Unlikely to accept.\n\nLet's reconsider. Player 0 previously accepted offers where they gained value. My goal is to gain value. So I need to make offers where I gain, and they perceive a gain (or at least no significant loss).\n\nOkay, let's look at my last rejected offer: 2 Wheat (10), 1 Wood (9) -> 1 Sheep (17).\nMy total cost: 19. My gain: 17. Net loss: -2. Player 0 received 19 value for giving up 17 value. Player 0 gained 2.\nSo it seems Player 0 wants to *gain* at least 2 value from a trade. And my previous successful trades confirm this.\n\nMy goal is to increase my value. So I need to offer less value than I receive.\nI need to reverse the previous patterns.\n\nWhat if I offer a resource that I have many of (Sheep), for something slightly higher value?\nOffer 2 Sheep (34) for 1 Ore (32) and 1 Wood (9) = 41. I lose 7. Bad.\n\nLet's try to trade my less valuable resources (Wheat, Wood) for more valuable ones (Brick, Ore).\nI have an abundance of sheep, and Brick.\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (20) for 1 Ore (32)? Gain of 12 for me. Player 0 loses 12. Still too much.\n\nI need to find a sweet spot where I gain value, and Player 0 also *thinks* they gain value or it's a very small loss they tolerate.\n\nLet's try this:\nI offer 2 Wood (value 18) and request 1 Brick (value 20).\nMy gain: 2. Player 0 loss: 2. This is the exact opposite of what they were accepting before. They gained 2. So now they would lose 2. This is unlikely to be accepted.\n\nI need to ensure I make a profit.\nPlayer 0 has rejected my last offer. It might be because they didn't see enough benefit for them.\n\nLet's try to offer a higher quantity of low-value resources for a single high-value resource.\nOffer: 3 Wheat (15) for 1 Sheep (17). Gain 2 for me. Lost 2 for Player 0. This is similar to the rejected one.\n\nHow about I offer something where my *quantity* goes down but my *value* goes up, and Player 0 gets more quantity?\nMaybe I can trade my 1 Sheep (17) for 3 Wheat (15) and 1 Wood (9) = 24.\nI lose (17-24) = 7. Player 0 gains 7. This would be accepted by Player 0, but it is bad for me. I need to ensure I increase my value.\n\nOkay, let's reverse that. I want to give 3 Wheat and 1 Wood and get 1 Sheep.\nMy offer: [Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep]\nMy cost: 3*5 (15) + 1*9 (9) = 24. My requested value: 17.\nThis is a loss of 7 for me. But Player 0 would GAIN 7. This aligns with what Player 0 accepted before. But it's losing value for me.\n\nI need to make a trade where *my* total value increases.\n\nLet's assume Player 0 just needs to gain *any* value.\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep (17) for 1 Brick (20). I gain 3. Player 0 loses 3.\nThis is a direct swap that benefits me. Player 0 might accept it if they really need sheep. I have a lot of sheep.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Wood (9) for 1 Brick (20). I gain 11. Player 0 loses 11. Unlikely.\n\nThe game is about increasing my total value.\nOkay, let's try a trade that is clearly beneficial to me, but not so unbalanced that it gets rejected immediately.\n\nI have 23 Sheep. Value 17.\nI have 18 Brick. Value 20.\nI have 14 Ore. Value 32.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nOption 1: Offer 1 Brick (20) for 1 Ore (32). Gain 12 for me. Loss 12 for P0. Player 0 won't accept this.\n\nLet's try trading something less valuable that I have a lot of, like Sheep.\nOffer: 1 Sheep (17) for 1 Brick (20). Gain 3 for me. Loss 3 for Player 0. This is a common kind of trade in these games. It's a small loss for P0, which they might tolerate to acquire Sheep.\n\nSince Player 0 previously accepted offers where they gained 2-4 value, it means they are looking for profit.\nI need to make an offer where *I* profit.\nThis means Player 0 will lose some value.\nSo I need to find a minimal loss for P0, with a maximal gain for me.\n\nMy goal: Increase my total value.\nResources:\nWheat: 12 @ 5 = 60\nWood: 15 @ 9 = 135\nSheep: 23 @ 17 = 391\nBrick: 18 @ 20 = 360\nOre: 14 @ 32 = 448\nTotal Value: 1394\n\nIf I trade 1 Sheep (17) for 1 Brick (20). My total value increases by 3.\nNew inventory:\nWheat: 12 @ 5 = 60\nWood: 15 @ 9 = 135\nSheep: 22 @ 17 = 374\nBrick: 19 @ 20 = 380\nOre: 14 @ 32 = 448\nNew Total Value: 1397 (a gain of 3)\n\nThis seems like a fair starting point for profitable trades. Player 0 loses 3 value.\nIs it worth the risk of rejection? Yes.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (20) for 1 Ore (32)? Gain 12. P0 loses 12. Too much.\n\nI will try the 1 Sheep for 1 Brick trade. It's concise and profitable for me.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",
