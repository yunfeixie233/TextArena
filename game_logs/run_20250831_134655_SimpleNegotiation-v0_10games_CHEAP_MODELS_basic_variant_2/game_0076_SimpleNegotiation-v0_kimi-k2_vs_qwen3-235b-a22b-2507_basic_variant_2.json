They may not give up Ore/Brick easily but might trade Wood for Sheep/Brick if it benefits them.\n\n### Initial Trades:\n- **Prioritize trading Wheat (6) and Wood (10)** for Brick/Ore or high-value Sheep.\n- **Avoid trading Brick (28) and Ore (33)** unless it clearly leads to higher-value outcomes.\n\n### Trade Proposal for Turn 1:\n**Offer:** Trade **5 Wood + 5 Wheat** (total value: 5*10 + 5*6 = 80) for **3 Brick** (value: 3*28 = 84). Trade values are offset (80 vs 84) to make it appealing, and Wood/Wheat are low-value for us, while Brick is high-value for us. The opponent might see this as gaining quantity (10 resources) for 3 Brick, which could be favorable if they lack Wood/Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 0 Sheep]",
