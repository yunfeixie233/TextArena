I have 15.\nPlayer 0 has rejected previous offers involving Ore.\n\nLet's offer some Wheat/Wood for Ore.\nOffer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore\nMy offer value: (3 * 5) + (2 * 8) = 15 + 16 = 31\nRequested value: 1 * 36 = 36. This is a gain for me of 5. Player 0 loses 5.\nThis might be too little gain for Player 0 to accept.\n\nLet's try to exchange some of my excess Wheat/Wood for Sheep/Brick.\nI have 18 wheat, Player 0 has 16 wheat.\nI have 14 wood, Player 0 has 12 wood.\nI have 5 sheep, Player 0 has 7 sheep.\nI have 16 brick, Player 0 has 18 brick.\nI have 15 ore, Player 0 has 17 ore.\n\nSince I have a lot of Wheat and Wood, I should try to trade those for Brick, Sheep, or Ore.\nPlayer 0 has 18 Brick and 17 Ore.\nLet's make an offer that is beneficial to both, or at least looks beneficial to Player 0.\n\nOffer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 2 Sheep, 1 Brick\nMy offer value: (4 * 8) + (2 * 5) = 32 + 10 = 42\nRequested value: (2 * 16) + (1 * 23) = 32 + 23 = 55\nMy net gain: 55 - 42 = 13.\nThis trade is good for me. Is it good enough for Player 0 to accept?\nPlayer 0 loses 2 Sheep (32) and 1 Brick (23) for a total of 55.\nPlayer 0 gains 4 Wood (32) and 2 Wheat (10) for a total of 42.\nPlayer 0's net loss: 42 - 55 = -13.\nThis is a loss for Player 0, so Player 0 might reject.\n\nLet me try to propose a balanced offer or a slight gain for Player 0, so it gets accepted.\nMy goal is to increase my overall value, even if it means giving Player 0 a little bit extra too as long as I get more valuable resources.\n\nGoal: Get Ore.\nOffer: 5 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 2 Ore\nMy offer value: (5 * 8) + (3 * 5) = 40 + 15 = 55\nRequested value: 2 * 36 = 72\nMy net gain: 72 - 55 = 17. Good for me.\nPlayer 0 offers 2 Ore (72). Gains 5 Wood (40) and 3 Wheat (15). Total 55.\nPlayer 0's net change: 55 - 72 = -17.\nThis is a significant loss for Player 0. Unlikely to be accepted.\n\nLet's try to offer high Qty of low value resources for high value resources.\nLet's try to target Brick from Player 0 as it's the next highest after Ore.\nPlayer 0 has 18 Brick, I have 16.\n\nOffer: 6 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 3 Brick\nMy offer value: (6 * 8) + (4 * 5) = 48 + 20 = 68\nRequested value: 3 * 23 = 69\nMy net gain: 69 - 68 = 1. Small gain, but positive.\nPlayer 0's net change: 68 - 69 = -1. Small loss. Maybe this is acceptable because it's almost even.\n\nLet's check other options.\nI have too much Wheat and Wood. Want to get rid of them for anything of higher value.\nI have 18 wheat, Player 0 has 16.\nI have 14 wood, Player 0 has 12.\nI have 5 sheep, Player 0 has 7.\nI have 16 brick, Player 0 has 18.\nI have 15 ore, Player 0 has 17.\n\nI will propose the 6 Wood, 4 Wheat for 3 Brick trade as it's almost even. This could be accepted.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 3 Brick]",
