      "response": "Let\u2019s think carefully: I rejected the previous offer because giving up 5 Sheep (worth 12 each = 60) plus 3 Brick (worth 29 each = 87) totals 147 value lost, while receiving 10 Wheat (worth 5 each = 50) and 10 Wood (worth 12 each = 120) totals 170 value gained for an apparent +23 net, but I actually don\u2019t need that many Wheat or Wood\u2014Brick and Sheep are scarcer for me.\n\nHowever, the exchange leaves me with only 4 Brick left, which is dangerously close to zero. Brick is what I value most (29). I need more Brick, not less.\n\nI need to propose a counter-offer that still improves my total value but more strategically manages Brick without bleeding it away.\n\nLooking at my inventory:\n- Wheat: 24 excess (low value, 5)\n- Sheep: 14 (valuable at 12, but I\u2019m willing to take 3 out)\n- Ore: 23 (very valuable at 35)\n\nI\u2019d love to get Brick without touching my own Brick supply. I can offer a mix of the less-critical Wheat and a few Sheep for a good chunk of Brick.\n\nLet\u2019s compute:  \nI offer 8 Wheat (8\u00d75 = 40) + 3 Sheep (3\u00d712 = 36) \u2192 total to give = 76.  \nI ask for 2 Brick (2\u00d729 = 58) + 1 Sheep (12) \u2192 total to receive = 70.  \nNet: +70 \u2013 76 = \u20136 value initially. But that -6 is lower, so not ideal. Maybe need to adjust slightly.\n\nBetter plan: instead of including a Sheep in the asking part, I ask for strictly Brick. I give 8 Wheat (40) + 4 Sheep (48) = 88, ask for 3 Brick (87). That\u2019s 88 \u2192 87: almost a straight swap, but I\u2019d lose 1 value; I can\u2019t accept.\n\nI\u2019ll instead ask for just 2 Brick while giving 8 Wheat + 2 Sheep: 8\u00d75+2\u00d712 = 40+24 = 64 give \u2192 2\u00d729 = 58 receive. Still slightly unbalanced, but I\u2019m okay taking a small value hit for extra Brick.\n\nActually, aim for fairness with a slight tilt in my favor: give 6 Wheat (30) + 3 Sheep (36) \u2192 66, ask for 2 Brick (58) + 1 Wood (12) \u2192 total receive 70. Net +4. That\u2019s perfect\u2014I gain 4 value, relieve excess Wheat/Sheep, and get Brick plus decent Wood.\n\nI\u2019ll propose that.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Wood]",
