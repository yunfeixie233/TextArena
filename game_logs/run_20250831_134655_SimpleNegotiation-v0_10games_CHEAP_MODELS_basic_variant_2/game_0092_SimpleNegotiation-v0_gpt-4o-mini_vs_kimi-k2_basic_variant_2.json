Since Player 1 seems to be low on wood, I'm considering trying a new offer that appeals to their current stock.\n\n### Next Offer\nI am going to try to trade 3 Ore for 5 Wheat. \n\n**Offer:**\n`[Offer: 3 Ore -> 5 Wheat]`\n\nThis would potentially allow me to increase my wheat quantity, which could be beneficial for future trades. If Player 1 is inclined to accept, it could work out. If they decline, I might need to reassess my approach based on their resources or consider offering a different combination. \n\n### Making the Offer\nLet's proceed with this offer:\n\n`[Offer: 3 Ore -> 5 Wheat]`",
