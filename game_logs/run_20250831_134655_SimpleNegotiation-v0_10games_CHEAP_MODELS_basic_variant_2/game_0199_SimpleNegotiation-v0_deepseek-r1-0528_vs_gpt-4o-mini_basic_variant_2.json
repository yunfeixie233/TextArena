      "response": "After carefully reviewing the trade history and current resource holdings, I note that trading 2 Sheep for 1 Ore consistently generates significant value (net +9 per trade, as 24 in Sheep value yields 33 in Ore). This ratio has been accepted twice before by Player 1, and I have ample Sheep (18 remaining) to spare. Given the success rate of this exchange and the high value of Ore, I propose it again to maximize gains in the remaining turns.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
