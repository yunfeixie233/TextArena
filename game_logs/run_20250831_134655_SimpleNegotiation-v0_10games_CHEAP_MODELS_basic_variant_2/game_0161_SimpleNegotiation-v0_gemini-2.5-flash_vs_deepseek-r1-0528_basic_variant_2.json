I understand you're interested in Ore, but I have a high valuation for it (38 per unit) since it's a scarce and valuable resource for my operations. Trading 1 Ore for just 2 Sheep and 2 Wheat (total value 34) results in a net loss of 4 value for me, which doesn't align with my goal of increasing my total resource value. \n\nHowever, I'm open to negotiation. If you're willing to offer more for the Ore, I can accommodate. Specifically, I'd be comfortable trading 1 Ore for 3 Sheep (valued at 12 each) and 2 Wheat (valued at 5 each). That totals 36 (from Sheep) + 10 (from Wheat) = 46 in value for me, compared to the 38 I'm losing. This gives me a net gain of 8, which is acceptable. \n\nIf this works for you, I'm happy to proceed with this counter-offer.
