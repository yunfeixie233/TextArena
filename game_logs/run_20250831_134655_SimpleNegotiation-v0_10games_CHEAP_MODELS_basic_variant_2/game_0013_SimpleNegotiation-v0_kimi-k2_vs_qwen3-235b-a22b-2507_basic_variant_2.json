      "response": "### Turn-by-Turn Analysis\n\n**Current Resources and Values:**\n- **Wheat:** 21 units at 5 each\n- **Wood:** 23 units at 8 each\n- **Sheep:** 14 units at 14 each\n- **Brick:** 13 units at 25 each\n- **Ore:** 12 units at 36 each\n\n**Current Total Value:**\n- Wheat: 21 * 5 = 105\n- Wood: 23 * 8 = 184\n- Sheep: 14 * 14 = 196\n- Brick: 13 * 25 = 325\n- Ore: 12 * 36 = 432\n- **Total:** 105 + 184 + 196 + 325 + 432 = 1242\n\n### Strategy\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources. Since no trades have been made yet, I need to initiate a trade that benefits me. The higher-value resources are Ore and Brick, so I should aim to receive more of these. Lower-value resources are Wheat and Wood, so I should offer these in exchange.\n\n### Potential Trades\n1. **Offer Wheat/Wood for Brick/Ore:** Since Wheat and Wood are lower in value per unit, offering these in exchange for Brick or Ore would increase my total value.\n   - Example: Offer 5 Wheat (value 25) and 5 Wood (value 40) for 3 Brick (value 75) and 1 Ore (value 36). This would be 65 (offered) for 111 (requested), which is too favorable to me and likely to be rejected.\n   - A more balanced offer: Offer 5 Wheat (25) and 2 Wood (16) for 1 Brick (25) and 1 Ore (36). This is 41 for 61, which is a gain of 20 for me, but may seem unfair to the opponent.\n\n2. **Offer Sheep for Brick/Ore:** Sheep is mid-value (14), but offering it could allow trading up to higher-value resources.\n   - Example: Offer 3 Sheep (42) for 1 Brick (25) and 1 Ore (36). This is 42 for 61, a gain of 19 for me, but again may seem unfair.\n\n3. **Offer Multiple Lower-Value for High-Value:**\n   - Example: Offer 3 Wheat (15) and 3 Wood (24) for 1 Ore (36). This is 39 for 36, a small loss but could be seen as fair.\n   - Alternatively, offer 2 Sheep (28) for 1 Ore (36), a gain of 8 for me, more balanced.\n\n### Optimal Trade\nTo make a fair-seeming offer that still benefits me, I should slightly undervalue my offered resources to incentivize the opponent. \n\n**Proposed Trade:**\nOffer 4 Wood (32) and 2 Wheat (10) for 1 Brick (25) and 1 Ore (36). This is 42 for 61, a gain of 19 for me, which is significant but could be framed as fair.\n\nHowever, this might seem too skewed. A better offer is:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]\n- Offered: 3 Sheep (42) + 2 Wood (16) = 58\n- Requested: 2 Brick (50) + 1 Ore (36) = 86\nThis is 58 for 86, a gain of 28 for me, but could be seen as too greedy.\n\nA more balanced:\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]\n- Offered: 4 Sheep (56) + 1 Wood (8) = 64\n- Requested: 2 Brick (50) + 1 Ore (36) = 86\nStill 64 for 86, gain of 22.\n\nEven more balanced:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]\n- Offered: 3 Sheep (42) + 1 Wheat (5) = 47\n- Requested: 1 Brick (25) + 1 Ore (36) = 61\nGain of 14, seems fair.\n\n### Final Choice\nThe most balanced offer that still gives me a reasonable gain is:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Potato -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]",
