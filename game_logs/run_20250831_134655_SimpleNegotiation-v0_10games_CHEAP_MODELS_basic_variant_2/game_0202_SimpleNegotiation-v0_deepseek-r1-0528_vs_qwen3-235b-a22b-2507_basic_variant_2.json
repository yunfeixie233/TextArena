Wheat and Wood are abundant for me and have lower per-unit value (6 and 9), so I can afford to offer more of them without significant loss. \n\nNew offer details:  \n- I offer **4 Wheat and 4 Wood** (my combined value: 4*6 + 4*9 = 60).  \n- I request **2 Ore** (value: 2*36 = 72).  \nIf accepted, this trade increases my total value by +12 (72 gained minus 60 lost) while reducing my surplus resources. The quantities are feasible given my current stocks (I still retain 13 Wheat and 18 Wood).\n\nThis offer also streams Wheat and Wood\u2014resources Player 1 might need\u2014for the valuable Ore they possess.
