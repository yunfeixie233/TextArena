I will deny this offer.\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I have a lot of Brick and Wood, and a decent amount of Sheep and Wheat. Ore is my most valuable resource, and I have a good amount of it.\n\nPlayer 1 seems to want Ore and Sheep. I want to get rid of some Wood and Brick, and maybe some Wheat. I also want to gain more valuable resources if possible.\n\nMy previous offer was \"2 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Wood, 3 Brick\", which Player 1 rejected twice.\nPlayer 1's previous offer was \"4 Wood, 2 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 2 Ore\" and now \"4 Wood, 2 Brick -> 1 Sheep, 2 Ore\". This suggests Player 1 is getting lower in their asks for Sheep.\n\nLet's try to offer a bit less of the high-value resources and ask for more of the lower-value ones that Player 1 might have a lot of.\n\nI still want to get rid of Wood and Brick. Player 1 seems very keen on getting Ore. I have 19 Ore.\nWhat if I offer a smaller amount of Ore, with some Sheep, for a larger quantity of Wood and Brick?\n\nConsider offering: 1 Sheep, 1 Ore\nRequested: 5 Wood, 3 Brick\n\nValue I offer:\n1 Sheep * 18 = 18\n1 Ore * 40 = 40\nTotal: 58\n\nValue I request:\n5 Wood * 11 = 55\n3 Brick * 21 = 63\nTotal: 118\n\nThis is a very good deal for me (+60 value), but likely too expensive for Player 1.\nLet's try to make it more balanced, but still beneficial for me.\n\nPlayer 1 offered 4 Wood, 2 Brick (value 86) for 1 Sheep, 2 Ore (value 98). They are willing to take a loss of 12.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep, 1 Ore (value 58) for something slightly less from Player 1?\nMaybe 4 Wood, 1 Brick? (44+21 = 65) That's a gain of 7.\n\nHow about I offer something less valuable, like 1 Ore, for more Wheat/Wood/Brick?\n1 Ore (40) for 2 Wood, 1 Brick? (22 + 21 = 43). That's a tiny gain of 3.\n\nLet's go back to what Player 1 is asking for: Ore and Sheep. I want to give up Wood/Brick.\nI'm still trying to acquire resources that are less abundant in my inventory, like Wheat, but Player 1 has not shown interest in giving up Wheat.\n\nLet's try to reduce my asking price for the Wood/Brick from Player 1, and make my offered goods more appealing.\nI offered 2 Sheep, 2 Ore for 5 Wood, 3 Brick. Value I give: 36+80 = 116. Value I request: 55+63 = 118. My gain: 2.\nPlayer 1 rejected this. Perhaps my requested resources are too high for them.\n\nLet's try again with a slightly more aggressive offer for Player 1, but still good for me.\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep, 2 Ore for 4 Wood, 2 Brick? (This is exactly what Player 1 asked for, but reversed - and they rejected that. So it doesn't make sense.)\n\nI will try to make an offer that is similar in value difference, but perhaps more quantities of items.\nPlayer 1 is willing to give 4 Wood, 2 Brick (value 86) and wants 1 Sheep, 2 Ore (value 98). They are willing to lose 12.\n\nLet me try to offer something with a loss for me, but smaller than their proposed loss.\nI have plenty of Wood and Brick.\nPerhaps offer 3 Wood, 2 Brick (val 33+42=75) for 1 Sheep, 1 Ore (val 18+40=58). I lose 17. That's not good.\n\nIt's clear I want to gain value.\nI will make an offer for Ore.\nHow about I offer 3 Wood, 3 Brick, 1 Sheep for 1 Ore.\nValue I offer:\n3 Wood * 11 = 33\n3 Brick * 21 = 63\n1 Sheep * 18 = 18\nTotal: 114\nValue I request:\n1 Ore * 40 = 40\nThis would be a huge loss. That's not how I want to play.\n\nI need to make a trade where I gain value.\nI have a surplus of Wood and Brick. I want more Ore/Sheep.\nPlayer 1 wants Ore/Sheep.\n\nLet's try: Offer 1 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 4 Wood, 2 Brick\nValue I offer: 18 + 40 = 58\nValue I request: 44 + 42 = 86\nMy gain: 28. This is a very good deal for me. Player 1 was willing to give 4W, 2B to get 1S, 2O (value 98). My offer is for them to get 1S, 1O (value 58) in exchange for the same 4W, 2B (value 86). So, they would gain 28 value. This is a possibility.\n\nSo, I will deny Player 1's offer, and then offer 1 Sheep, 1 Ore for 4 Wood, 2 Brick.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 4 Wood, 2 Brick]",
