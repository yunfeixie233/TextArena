Here\u2019s what I will do next:\n\n1. **Evaluate the current resources**: \n   - I have 21 Wheat, 9 Wood, 22 Sheep, 13 Brick, and 7 Ore.\n   - Player 1 is trying to acquire Sheep, which I have in good quantity.\n\n2. **Offer a new trade**: Since Player 1 seems interested in acquiring Sheep, I will make an offer that attempts to give them enough Sheep while gaining a more valuable resource in return.\n\n3. **New Offer**: \n   - I will offer 5 Sheep in exchange for 2 Ore and 2 Brick, which seems more aligned with my goal of improving overall resource value.\n\nHere\u2019s my offer:\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 2 Brick]",
