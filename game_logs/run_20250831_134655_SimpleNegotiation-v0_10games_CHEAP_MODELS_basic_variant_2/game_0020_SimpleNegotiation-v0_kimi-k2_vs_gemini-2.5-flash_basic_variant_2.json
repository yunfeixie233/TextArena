      "response": "Thinking through the trade history so far:\n\n1. I lost 4 Wheat & 2 Sheep (~48 value), gained 3 Brick & 2 Ore (~117 value) \u2014 strong first swap.\n2. I then paid 5 Wheat (~30 value) for 1 Ore & 1 Wood (~50 value) in the subsequent swap Player 1 pushed.\n\nOverall I\u2019ve given away 9 Wheat + 2 Sheep (~78 value) in exchange for 3 Brick + 3 Ore + 1 Wood (~167 value). That\u2019s a gain of about 2.1\u00d7 in those exchanges.  \n\nNow Player 1 is proposing 4 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore + 1 Wood, i.e., exactly the rate they just got. Accepting again would give away another 4 Wheat (~24 value) for 1 Ore + 1 Wood (~50 value), another profitable swap that keeps raising my aggregate value per-wheat.  \n\nAccepting now leaves me:\n\nWheat: 5  \nWood: 9  \nSheep: 4  \nBrick: 16  \nOre: 22  \n\nThis distribution is still comfortably skewed away from Wheat (my lowest-value resource) toward everything else. Accepting uses one of the few remaining turns, so it\u2019s the last quick-gains move I\u2019ll take this game; I want to quit trading and hold the appreciated assets.\n\n[Accept]",
