What resources are \u201ccheap\u201d to me?  \n    \u2022 Wheat (5) and Wood (10) are lowest-value holdings.  \n    \u2022 Sheep (12) is next-low but I already have little (only 8).  \n    \u2022 Brick (23) I have lots (19), so it is my most fungible card that is not the ultra-high Ore (40).  \n    \u2022 Ore (40) is most valuable; I only have 10.  I want *more* Ore.\n\n3.  What I would like to do  \n    a. Increase Ore count (currently 10).  \n    b. Convert surplus Wheat and Wood into something higher-value (Ore, or failing that Sheep/Brick).\n\n4.  Constraints from earlier offers  \n    \u2022 Player 0 already refused to give me Brick \u2194 Wheat+Wood or my Brick \u2194 Sheep+Ore offers, so a straight repeat will almost certainly be denied.  \n    \u2022 He therefore seems averse to giving me Ore/S sheep when I\u2019m proffering brick.  \n    \u2022 We\u2019ve only one turn left (implicit round-10 situation because \u201cgame lasts 10 turns\u201d), so an either-accept-or-bust offer is needed.\n\n5.  Simplest mutually-advantageous proposal  \n    I only have 4 Wheat (after -5 Wheat/-5 Wood in the proposal) but that still leaves me enough of everything else.\n\n    My goal: trim the *least valuable* cards (Wheat and Wood) to grab more Sheep/Ore.  \n    Player 0 earlier *offered* 10 Brick for 5 Wheat+5 Wood.  That tells me he *wants* Wheat+Wood and is willing to part with Brick, the lowest of his own cards (in his perspective).  If I sweeten the ratio a bit, he may bite.\n\n    Option: Give away *all* 10 of my lowest-value Wheat (5 each) and 5 of my Wood (10 each) in exchange for 11 Brick (I earlier wanted Sheep or Ore, but Player 0 rejected those).  The 11 Brick let me flip the utility: 11 * 23 = 253, for a bundle worth (10*5 + 5*10) = 100, I make 153 value gain straight up.\n\n    However, Brain-storm alternative: give 8 Wheat + 2 Wood to keep Wood-count comfortable while still dumping the weakest resource.  8*5 + 2*10 = 60, ask for 6 Brick.  Player 0 valued 10 Brick at 5 Wheat 5 Wood before; scaling this, 6 Brick for 8 Wheat 2 Wood is *better* than a full 11-Brick-for-10-5 he initially proposed.\n\n    Player 0 might now accept.\n\n6.
