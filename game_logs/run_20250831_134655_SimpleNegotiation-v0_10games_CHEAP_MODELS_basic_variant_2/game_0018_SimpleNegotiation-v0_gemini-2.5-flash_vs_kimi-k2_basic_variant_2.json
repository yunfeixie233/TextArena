      "response": "Okay, I understand. I am Player 0, and my goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I need to make trade offers and accept/deny offers from Player 1. I will carefully track my resources and their values.\n\nHere's my current inventory:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 11 Value: 5\n*   [Wood] Qty: 19 Value: 9\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 5 Value: 15\n*   [Brick] Qty: 6 Value: 21\n*   [Ore] Qty: 7 Value: 37\n\nThe last turn, I offered 5 Wood for 1 Ore, and Player 1 accepted. This means my resources have changed.\n\n**Before Trade:**\n*   [Wood] Qty: 19, Value: 9. Total Value: 19 * 9 = 171\n*   [Ore] Qty: 7, Value: 37. Total Value: 7 * 37 = 259\n\n**After Trade:**\n*   [Wood] Qty: 19 - 5 = 14. Total Value: 14 * 9 = 126\n*   [Ore] Qty: 7 + 1 = 8. Total Value: 8 * 37 = 296\n\nLet's re-calculate my total value.\n\n**Initial Total Value (before the first accepted trade):**\n(11 * 5) + (19 * 9) + (5 * 15) + (6 * 21) + (7 * 37) = 55 + 171 + 75 + 126 + 259 = **686**\n\n**Current Total Value (after the accepted trade):**\n(11 * 5) + (14 * 9) + (5 * 15) + (6 * 21) + (8 * 37) = 55 + 126 + 75 + 126 + 296 = **678**\n\nWait, my total value decreased!\n5 wood (5 * 9 = 45 value) was traded for 1 ore (1 * 37 = 37 value).\nThis trade resulted in a net loss of 8 value. My apologies, I miscalculated the value of the trade. My goal is to *increase* my total value.\n\nOkay, I need to be more careful with the value calculation per trade.\n\nCurrent inventory after the (bad) trade:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 11 Value: 5 (Value: 55)\n*   [Wood] Qty: 14 Value: 9 (Value: 126)\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 5 Value: 15 (Value: 75)\n*   [Brick] Qty: 6 Value: 21 (Value: 126)\n*   [Ore] Qty: 8 Value: 37 (Value: 296)\n**Current Total Value: 678**\n\nI need to make a profitable offer this turn. Ore is my highest value resource. Brick is also good. Wood and Wheat are relatively low value. I have a lot of wood.\n\nI will try to trade up my lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\nI have a decent amount of Wood. I want more Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's consider trading Wood for Brick.\n1 Brick = 21 value.\n1 Wood = 9 value.\nSo, I need to offer at least 3 wood for 1 brick (3 * 9 = 27, which is more than 21).\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\n1 Ore = 37 value.\nI'll offer Wheat and Wood for Ore.\n\nOffer: 2 Wheat (2*5=10) + 3 Wood (3*9=27) = 37 value.\nThis is equivalent to 1 Ore (37 value). This is a fair trade by value, but it uses up lower value resources, consolidating into a higher value one, which might be strategically good if it enables future higher-value trades or just makes my inventory more concentrated in valuable items.\n\nHowever, Player 1 accepted my *last* disadvantageous offer. Maybe I can exploit this?\nIf I offer slightly less value than I request, and they accept, I win.\n\nLet's aim for a small profit.\nI have plenty of Wood.\nWhat if I offer 4 Wood (4 * 9 = 36 value) for 1 Brick (21 value)? That would be a huge loss. I need to be careful.\n\nI want to *gain* value.\nExample: I offer X value resources and request Y value resources where Y > X.\n\nTry to get some Brick.\nI offer Wood for Brick.\n1 Brick = 21 Value.\nWhat if I offer 1 Wood (9) and 1 Wheat (5)? That's 14 value. Not enough for 1 Brick.\nWhat if I offer 2 Wood (18) for 1 Brick (21)? This is a gain of 3 value for me if accepted! This seems like a reasonable offer for Player 1, as 2 Wood is a common amount.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
