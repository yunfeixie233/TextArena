The highest value resource we have is Ore followed by Brick. \n\nAn initial trade we could consider offering is:\n- **Offer 3 Sheep and 2 Ore for 5 Brick and 2 Sheep**\nGiven that:\n- 3 Sheep = 3 x 14 = 42 \n- 2 Ore = 2 x 38 = 76 \n- **Total Offered Value = 42 + 76 = 118**\n- 5 Brick = 5 x 20 = 100 \n- 2 Sheep = 2 x 14 = 28 \n- **Total Requested Value = 100 + 28 = 128**\n\nThis trade has a positive potential profit since the requested resources are valued higher than what I'm offering. \n\nSo my move will be:\n\n**Action:** \n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep] \n\nLet's see how the opponent responds!",
