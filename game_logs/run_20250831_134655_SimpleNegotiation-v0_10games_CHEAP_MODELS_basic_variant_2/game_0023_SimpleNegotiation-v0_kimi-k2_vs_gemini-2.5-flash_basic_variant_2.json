      "response": "The previous offer was rejected. I need to make a new offer that is more appealing to Player 0, or at least one that I think Player 0 will accept.\n\nLet's re-evaluate my resources and their values:\n- Wheat: 25 Qty, Value: 5 (Total Value: 125)\n- Wood: 17 Qty, Value: 8 (Total Value: 136)\n- Sheep: 6 Qty, Value: 18 (Total Value: 108)\n- Brick: 16 Qty, Value: 30 (Total Value: 480)\n- Ore: 22 Qty, Value: 35 (Total Value: 770)\nMy total current value is 125 + 136 + 108 + 480 + 770 = 1619.\n\nMy previous offer was \"10 Wheat -> 3 Ore\".\nValue of 10 Wheat = 10 * 5 = 50.\nValue of 3 Ore = 3 * 35 = 105.\nThis was a good trade for me if it went through. Player 0 rejected it, which implies they didn't see enough value in 10 Wheat for 3 Ore.\n\nPerhaps I can offer something that Player 0 might need more, or offer a better deal for them. I have a lot of Ore and Brick. I also have a fair amount of Wheat and Wood. Sheep is my lowest quantity.\n\nLet's try to get more Sheep or Wood, as their values are lower, so I'd need less of them to gain value.\nOr, I can try to continue trading my lower-value items (Wheat, Wood) for higher-value items (Ore, Brick, or even Sheep if the ratio is right).\n\nSince Player 0 rejected my previous offer, they probably want more for their Ore, or they don't value Wheat as much.\n\nLet's try to offer something different. Maybe I can offer some Brick for Ore, since I have a lot of Brick. Or a combination.\n\nWhat if I offer a smaller amount of Ore for something I value more?\nI have 22 Ore. If I can trade 1 Ore for 2 Sheep, for example.\nValue of 1 Ore = 35. Value of 2 Sheep = 2 * 18 = 36. This is a good trade for me. But Player 0 also knows the values.\n\nLet's consider what Player 0 might need. Without knowing their inventory, it's hard to guess. However, low quantity items for me could also be low for them.\n\nLet's make an offer where I give up some of my high-quantity, lower-value items, for a higher-value item.\nI have a significant amount of Wheat and Wood.\nWhat about offering a mix?\n\nLet's try to get Ore again, as it's the highest value. But this time, I'll offer more.\nInstead of 10 Wheat for 3 Ore, which was 50 value for 105 value (gain of 55 for me).\nWhat if I offer 15 Wheat for 3 Ore?\nValue of 15 Wheat = 15 * 5 = 75. Value of 3 Ore = 3 * 35 = 105. My gain is 30. Still good for me. Player 0 gets 75 value for 105 value. It's a loss for them, but maybe they really need Wheat.\n\nLet's try to structure an offer that is slightly less in my favor, but still gains me value.\nMy current target is to increase my total value.\n\nPerhaps I can trade some Brick, as I have a lot (16) and a high value per unit (30).\nIf I trade 1 Brick (30 value) for 1 Ore (35 value), I gain 5 value. This is a very good trade for me, but maybe too obviously good.\n\nLet's try offering a mix of my lower value resources for a higher value resource.\nI have 25 Wheat and 17 Wood.\n\nWhat about 5 Wheat and 5 Wood for 2 Ore?\nValue of 5 Wheat = 5 * 5 = 25.\nValue of 5 Wood = 5 * 8 = 40.\nTotal offered value = 25 + 40 = 65.\nValue of 2 Ore = 2 * 35 = 70.\nHere, I exchange 65 value for 70 value, a gain of 5. Player 0 exchanges 70 value for 65 value, a loss of 5. This is a balanced, but slightly disadvantageous trade for Player 0. They might accept if they need Wheat and Wood.\n\nLet's try another offer. I still have a lot of Ore. But I also have a lot of Brick.\nWhat if I offer something generous for Sheep, as I have a low quantity of it?\nFor example, 1 Ore for 2 Sheep. Value 35 for 36. Good deal for me.\nOr 1 Brick for 2 Sheep. Value 30 for 36. Good deal for me, and Player 0 loses 6 value.\n\nLet's be a bit more aggressive in my favour, but not too extreme.\nI will try to trade some of my high quantity resources (Wheat, Wood) for a higher value item (Ore).\nPerhaps the issue with the previous offer was the perceived value for Player 0.\n\"10 Wheat -> 3 Ore\" (50 for 105)\n\nWhat if I offer a better ratio of Wheat for Ore?\nMaybe 15 Wheat for 2 Ore?\nValue of 15 Wheat = 15 * 5 = 75.\nValue of 2 Ore = 2 * 35 = 70.\nThis would be a loss of 5 for me. I don't want to make offers that result in a loss for me.\n\nLet's stick to offers where I gain value.\nHow about a direct trade of a lower value resource for a higher value one, but sweetened for Player 0?\n\nI could offer a significant amount of my lowest value (Wheat) for a unit of my highest value (Ore).\n25 Wheat (125 value) and I have 22 Ore (770 value).\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nWhat if I offer some Brick, which has a high value and I have many.\nExample: 2 Brick for 2 Ore? Value 60 for 70. Gain 10 for me. This is a good trade for me, a loss of 10 for Player 0.\n\nLet's try to offer a more tempting amount of items that Player 0 might need, while still gaining me value.\nWhat if I offer some Wood and Wheat for Ore?\nI have 17 Wood and 25 Wheat.\n\nOffer: 8 Wood, 8 Wheat -> 2 Ore\nValue of 8 Wood = 8 * 8 = 64\nValue of 8 Wheat = 8 * 5 = 40\nTotal offered value = 104\nValue of 2 Ore = 2 * 35 = 70\nThis is a loss for me (-34 value). I won't make this offer.\n\nI need to make an offer where offered value < requested value.\n\nOffer: 5 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 2 Ore\nValue of 5 Wood = 5 * 8 = 40\nValue of 5 Wheat = 5 * 5 = 25\nTotal offered value = 65\nValue of 2 Ore = 2 * 35 = 70\nGain of 5 for me. Loss of 5 for Player 0. This is the same offer I considered before. Let's try it.\n\nI will try to offer something relatively abundant for me (Wheat, Wood) for something valuable (Ore).\nThe previous turn was \"10 Wheat -> 3 Ore\" (50 for 105).\nMaybe 3 Ore was too much to ask for 10 Wheat.\nSo maybe I reduce the requested Ore, and keep the offered Wheat?\n\"10 Wheat -> 2 Ore\" (50 for 70). This is a gain of 20 for me, and a loss of 20 for Player 0. This might be too much of a loss for them.\n\nLet's try to offer something that is less resource intensive for me, but still gains me value.\nI have a lot of Brick. Let's try trading Brick for Ore.\nBrick value = 30. Ore value = 35.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (90 value) for 3 Ore (105 value), I gain 15 value.\nThis is a good trade for me, and Player 0 loses 15 value. It's a reasonable loss for them if they need Brick.\n\nLet's try this. I have plenty of Brick.\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 3 Ore]",

Player 0 accepted, so it was good for them.\n\nI need to make a trade where the requested items have a higher value than the offered items.\n\nI have a lot of Brick and Ore, which are high value. Wood and Wheat are lower value. Sheep is mid-value.\n\nI want to get more of the high-value items, like Ore and Brick, by trading away lower-value items, or trading items I have in abundance for items I need more of.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat for Ore.\nValue of 10 Wheat = 10 * 5 = 50\nValue of 2 Ore = 2 * 35 = 70\nThis would be a good trade for me, gaining 20 value.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",
