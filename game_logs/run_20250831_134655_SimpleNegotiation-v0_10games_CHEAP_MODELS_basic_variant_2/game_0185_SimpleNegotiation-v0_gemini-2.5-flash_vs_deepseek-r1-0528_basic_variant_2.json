      "response": "Okay, I've received the update. Player 1 accepted my previous offer. This means my resources have changed.\n\nHere's my current resource inventory and total value:\n\n**My Resources (Updated):**\n\n*   **[Wheat]** Qty: 6    Value: 5\n*   **[Wood]** Qty: 15   Value: 10 (Decreased by 5)\n*   **[Sheep]** Qty: 7    Value: 13\n*   **[Brick]** Qty: 18   Value: 22\n*   **[Ore]** Qty: 13    Value: 40 (Increased by 1)\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Ore is a high-value resource. I effectively traded 5 Wood (Value: 50) for 1 Ore (Value: 40). This was not a good trade in terms of pure value, but perhaps they have a surplus of Ore and I need it for some future strategy. Let's re-evaluate.\n\nActually, the previous trade was 5 Wood (value 10 each, total 50) for 1 Ore (value 40). My total value decreased by 10. I need to be more careful with my offers. My goal is to *increase* my total value.\n\nLet's calculate my total value before and after the trade:\n\n**Before Trade:**\n*   Wheat: 6 * 5 = 30\n*   Wood: 20 * 10 = 200\n*   Sheep: 7 * 13 = 91\n*   Brick: 18 * 22 = 396\n*   Ore: 12 * 40 = 480\n*   **Total Value Before: 1197**\n\n**After Trade:**\n*   Wheat: 6 * 5 = 30\n*   Wood: 15 * 10 = 150 (lost 5 Wood, value 50)\n*   Sheep: 7 * 13 = 91\n*   Brick: 18 * 22 = 396\n*   Ore: 13 * 40 = 520 (gained 1 Ore, value 40)\n*   **Total Value After: 1187**\n\nMy value decreased by 10. I made a bad trade. I need to ensure my future trades increase my total value. I have a lot of Brick, which is also a high-value item, and a good amount of Wood. I might want to acquire more high-value items like Ore or even Sheep if the exchange rate is good.\n\nI will try to trade some of my excess Brick or Wood for high-value items. I have 18 Brick (Value 22) and 15 Wood (Value 10). Ore (Value 40) is my highest value.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, or convert lower-value items into higher-value items efficiently.\nFor example, if I trade 1 Brick (22) for 1 Sheep (13), that's bad.\nIf I trade 1 Brick (22) for 1 Wheat (5), that's very bad.\n\nI want to trade for something valuable. I have a good amount of Brick. I could try to get more Ore.\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (Value 22) for 1 Wheat (Value 5) + 1 Sheep (Value 13)? Total requested value is 18, so less than my offer. No.\n\nI need to aim for a positive value exchange.\nMaybe 1 Brick (22) for 1 Ore (40)? That's unlikely for Player 1.\nWhat about trading some Wood for Sheep? 1 Wood (10) for 1 Sheep (13) would be good.\nI have a decent amount of Brick, which is high value.\n\nLet's try to trade some Brick for Ore.\nMy current Ore quantity is 13. I want more.\n\nI will offer a resource I have in abundance (Brick) for a higher value resource (Ore).\nPerhaps 1 Brick (22) for 1 Ore (40)? That's over double the value for them.\nThey accepted my last bad offer. Let's see if they'll accept a slightly better one for me.\n\nConsider the values carefully:\n1 Brick = 22\n1 Ore = 40\n1 Sheep = 13\n1 Wood = 10\n1 Wheat = 5\n\nI want to get more Ore.\nIf I give 1 Brick (22) for 1 Ore (40), player 1 gives me 40 value for 22 value. Unlikely.\nIf they accepted 5 Wood (50) for 1 Ore (40) last time, maybe they have a surplus of Ore and want other things. That trade was bad for me. I need to flip this.\n\nHow about I offer 2 Brick (44) for 1 Ore (40) and 1 Wheat (5)? That's 44 for 45. Good for me.\nOr 2 Brick (44) for 1 Ore (40) and 1 Wood (10)? That's 44 for 50. Good for me. But maybe too much of a loss for them.\n\nLet's try a single-item trade.\nMy inventory: Wheat 6, Wood 15, Sheep 7, Brick 18, Ore 13.\n\nOffering Brick for Ore at a rate that benefits me.\nWhat about offering a lower value item for a higher value item, *plus* a bit of my higher value item.\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI want more Ore. I have plenty of Brick and Wood.\nLet's make an offer where I gain value.\nOffer: 1 Brick (22) -> Request: 1 Sheep (13) + 2 Wheat (10) = 23. This is slightly good for me.\nOffer: 1 Brick (22) -> Request: 1 Ore (40)? No.\nOffer: 2 Brick (44) -> Request: 1 Ore (40) + 1 Wheat (5)? This gives me 45 value for 44. Marginal gain.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nI will offer something they might need, that I have a lot of, for Ore.\nI have 18 Brick.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore] (Value 44 for 40) This is a loss for me. I need to make a profit.\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick] (Value 40 for 44) This is a profit for me. But I want to GAIN Ore.\n\nI have 13 Ore. I want more Ore.\nI can offer Wood or Brick.\nLet's try this: I have 15 Wood. I have 7 Sheep.\nSheep value 13. Wood value 10. Ore value 40.\n\nI will propose a trade where I offer a quantity of lower-value items for one higher-value item.\nHow about I offer 3 Wood (30 total value) for 1 Sheep (13 total value)? Bad for me.\nHow about I offer 1 Ore (40) for 2 Brick (44)? This would make me lose an ore, but gain 4 value. No, that contradicts my goal of more ore.\n\nMy goal is to increase total value, and preferably acquire more high-value resources like Ore.\nI have 18 Brick.\nWhat if I offer 2 Wood (20) and 1 Wheat (5) = 25 value for 1 Brick (22)? My value decreases.\n\nLet's try this:\nI have 18 Brick. Each is value 22.\nI want Ore. Each is value 40.\nI could offer 2 Brick for 1 Ore (44 vs 40). This is a loss of 4 value for me.\n\nI need to make an offer that is profitable for me.\nWhat if I target Sheep? I have 7 Sheep (value 13).\nOffer: 1 Wood (10) -> Request: 1 Wheat (5) + 1 Sheep (13). This is 10 for 18. Good for me.\nLet's try to exchange Wood for Sheep and Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat]",
