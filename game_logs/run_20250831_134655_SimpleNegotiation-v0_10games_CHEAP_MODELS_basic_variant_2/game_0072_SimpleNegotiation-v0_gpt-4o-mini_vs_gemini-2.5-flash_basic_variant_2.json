To increase the total value of my resources, I need to reassess the current offers and come up with a new strategy. \n\nWith my current resources, I have:\n\n- Wheat: 23 (Value: 6 each)\n- Wood: 16 (Value: 8 each)\n- Sheep: 17 (Value: 15 each)\n- Brick: 25 (Value: 21 each)\n- Ore: 24 (Value: 35 each)\n\nBased on my previous offers being rejected, it might be beneficial to change the composition of my offers or the quantities of resources I propose.\n\n### New Offer Strategy\nOne potential strategy is to leverage the value of my more abundant resources, such as Brick and Ore, while offering less valuable resources in exchange.\n\n### New Offer Proposal\nI can offer a larger quantity of Brick which has a value of 21 and is likely desired by Player 1. Let's try a more attractive offer:\n\n**Offer:** \n- Offered items: 8 Brick, 4 Wood \n- Requested items: 5 Ore, 2 Sheep \n\n### Formatted Offer\n[Offer: 8 Brick, 4 Wood -> 5 Ore, 2 Sheep] \n\nI will submit this offer to Player 1 and hope for a positive response.",
