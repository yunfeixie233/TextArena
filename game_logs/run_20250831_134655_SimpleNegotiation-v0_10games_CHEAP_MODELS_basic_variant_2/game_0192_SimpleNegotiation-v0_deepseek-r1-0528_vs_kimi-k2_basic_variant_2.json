      "response": "After reviewing our trade history and current resources, I see an opportunity to continue a mutually beneficial exchange pattern. Since Player1 previously accepted 10 Wheat and 1 Sheep for 3 Ore (which increased my net value last time), I'll propose this proven trade again. My current inventory can comfortably support this without depleting critical resources.\n\n**Offer Calculation:**  \n- I offer **10 Wheat (value 60) + 1 Sheep (value 17)** = Total cost to me **77**  \n- I request **3 Ore (value 96)** = Net gain **+19**  \nThis maintains positive value growth while using abundant low/mid-value resources (Wheat and Sheep) to acquire high-value Ore.  \n\nGiven Player1\u2019s prior acceptance of identical terms and their willingness to trade Ore in earlier rounds (e.g., exchanging Ore for Wood), I anticipate openness to this proposal.  \n\n**Action:**  \n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 3 Ore]",
