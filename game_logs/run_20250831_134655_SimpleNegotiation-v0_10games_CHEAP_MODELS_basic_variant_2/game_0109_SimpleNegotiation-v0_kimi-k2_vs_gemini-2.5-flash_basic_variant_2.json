You only have 6 Wheat, so you cannot accept this offer. Even if you could, the value exchange is not in your favor (you give up 94, you get 108, but you don't have enough to give).\n\nLet's make a new offer that is more beneficial to me. I have plenty of high-value Brick and Ore, and a decent amount of less valuable Wood and Sheep. I'm low on Wheat.\n\nI want to get more Wheat.\nI have plenty of Ore, Brick, Wood.\n\nLet's try to convert some of my Wood and Sheep into Wheat.\nI need to make sure I'm getting more value than I'm giving.\n\nLet's consider an offer:\nOffer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 4 Wheat\n\nMy resources:\n- Wheat: 6 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 17 (Value: 9)\n- Sheep: 11 (Value: 16)\n- Brick: 16 (Value: 30)\n- Ore: 24 (Value: 36)\n\nLet's calculate the value of my proposed offer:\nOffered:\n- 3 Wood (Value: 3 * 9 = 27)\n- 2 Sheep (Value: 2 * 16 = 32)\nTotal offered value = 27 + 32 = 59\n\nRequested:\n- 4 Wheat (Value: 4 * 5 = 20)\n\nThis offer is not good for me as I am giving up 59 value to gain 20 value. I need to make an offer where I gain more value than I give.\n\nLet's try to get Ore which is high value, from my lower value resources.\nOr I can offer very high values of my abundant resources to get a significant amount of a scarce resource.\n\nLet's try to get Sheep. I have 11 but it's a good mid-range resource.\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of low value resource for a high value one?\n\nHow about offering some Brick and Ore, but only a small amount, to get other resources, especially Wheat that I'm low on.\nI have a lot of Ore (24) and Brick (16). Let's try to trade some of those for Wheat.\n\nOffer: 2 Brick -> 4 Wheat, 1 Wood\nOffered: 2 * 30 = 60\nRequested: 4 * 5 + 1 * 9 = 20 + 9 = 29\nThis is still bad for me. I need to get more value than I give.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood and Sheep for Ore. My biggest resource is Ore, maybe I don't want to get more of it.\nI want to increase value, so I should try to trade low-value items for high-value items where possible.\n\nLet's try this:\nOffer: 5 Wood -> 1 Ore\n\nOffered: 5 Wood (Value: 5 * 9 = 45)\nRequested: 1 Ore (Value: 1 * 36 = 36)\nThis again is negative for me.\n\nThe opponent offered me 8 Wheat and 6 Wood for 3 Ore.\nOffered: 8*5 + 6*9 = 40 + 54 = 94\nRequested: 3*36 = 108\nThey want to gain 14 points of value.\n\nI should try to make an offer where I gain at least 15-20 value.\n\nLet's try offering a mix of resources. I am rich in Ore and Brick.\nI will try to get Wheat, which I have the least of.\n\nOffer: 1 Ore -> 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep\n\nOffered: 1 Ore (Value: 1 * 36 = 36)\nRequested: 3 Wheat (Value: 3 * 5 = 15) + 1 Sheep (Value: 1 * 16 = 16)\nTotal requested value = 15 + 16 = 31\n\nThis is also a loss for me (-5 value).\n\nI need to be very careful with the value calculation. I want to give less value and get more value.\n\nLet's try trading low value items I have for high value items.\nI have 17 Wood and 11 Sheep. These are lower value than Brick and Ore.\n\nOffer: 8 Wood -> 2 Brick\n\nOffered: 8 Wood (Value: 8 * 9 = 72)\nRequested: 2 Brick (Value: 2 * 30 = 60)\nStill a loss.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of a low value item for a small quantity of a high value item?\nI have 17 Wood, 11 Sheep.\nHow about: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore\n\nOffered: 5 Sheep (Value: 5 * 16 = 80)\nRequested: 1 Ore (Value: 1 * 36 = 36)\nThis is a huge loss for me.\n\nAlright, let's reverse the strategy. I'm rich in Ore and Brick, they are high value. I can use them to get a lot of other resources, especially Wheat.\n\nOffer: 1 Ore -> 3 Wheat, 2 Wood, 1 Sheep\n\nOffered: 1 Ore (Value: 1 * 36 = 36)\nRequested:\n- 3 Wheat (Value: 3 * 5 = 15)\n- 2 Wood (Value: 2 * 9 = 18)\n- 1 Sheep (Value: 1 * 16 = 16)\nTotal requested value = 15 + 18 + 16 = 49\n\nThis offer gives me a value increase of 49 - 36 = 13.\nI have 24 Ore, so I can definitely spare 1.\nI also get resources that I have less of (Wheat). This feels like a good offer.\n\nLet's review the opponent's rejected offer, it means they are trying to get good value too.\nOpponent offered: 8 Wheat, 6 Wood -> 3 Ore. (They want 108 value for 94 value) They gained 14 points if I accepted.\n\nMy current offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Wheat, 2 Wood, 1 Sheep\nI give 36 value, I get 49 value. I gain 13 value. This is a positive trade for me.\n\nThe quantity of items in my offer:\nGive: 1 item (Ore)\nGet: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood, 1 Sheep (6 items)\nThis is a good exchange in terms of quantity as well, especially considering Wheat.\n\nI will make this offer.\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Wheat, 2 Wood, 1 Sheep]",
