That doesn't align with my goal to increase my holdings. Ore and Brick are highly valuable to me, so I need to preserve them unless the trade significantly benefits my position.\n\nHowever, I'm still interested in trading for Brick. In my previous offers, I targeted Brick because I value it at 24 per unit\u2014higher than resources like Wood (12) or Wheat (6). I see you're open to trading Wheat and Wood, but I have surpluses of both already. Instead, let's focus on a mutually beneficial exchange. I'll reiterate my earlier stance: I can offer Ore, which you seem to want, but only for Brick at a fair ratio.\n\nTo keep things moving, I propose: **3 of my Ore for 6 of your Bricks**. From my perspective, Ore is worth 39 each, so I'm giving 117 in value for 144 in return\u2014a gain of 27 for me. For you, this might appeal if you're low on Ore and have excess Brick.
