      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, let's first analyze the current state of our resources and their values:\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 7, Value: 5\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 24, Value: 10\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 14, Value: 18\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 16, Value: 26\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 8, Value: 35\n\nOur total value can be calculated as follows:\n- Total Value = (7 * 5) + (24 * 10) + (14 * 18) + (16 * 26) + (8 * 35)\n- Total Value = 35 + 240 + 252 + 416 + 280\n- Total Value = 1223\n\nTo increase the total value, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or acquire more quantity of resources that have a higher value per unit.\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Identify Overvalued and Undervalued Resources**: \n   - The resources with the highest value per unit are Ore (35), Brick (26), Sheep (18), Wood (10), and Wheat (5).\n   - We have a good quantity of Wood, Brick, and Sheep, but Ore is highly valued and we have a relatively low quantity of it.\n\n2. **Trade Strategy**:\n   - We can offer resources like Wood (Value: 10) or Wheat (Value: 5) in exchange for Ore (Value: 35) or possibly Brick (Value: 26) if we can negotiate a good deal.\n   - Since Brick is relatively abundant for us and has a high value, we should be cautious not to give away too much Brick.\n\n### Initial Offer\n\nLet's examine a potential trade that could increase our total value. Offering some Wood for Ore seems like a viable option because Wood is relatively less valuable than Ore.\n\nTo make a reasonable offer, let's consider the quantities:\n- We have 24 Wood, and offering 4-5 Wood for 1-2 Ore could be a starting point.\n\nLet's make an initial offer:\n- **[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]**\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 5 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 2 Ore]`\nHowever, to fit the exact format required, it simplifies to: `[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]`\n\nLet's issue this offer.\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]`\n\nThis offer is made with the expectation that the opponent will consider it beneficial or be willing to negotiate further. We are attempting to gain more Ore, which is highly valued, by giving up some Wood, which is less valued per unit.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- We will wait for the opponent's response to our offer.\n- Based on their response (accept, deny, or counteroffer), we will adjust our strategy for subsequent turns.",

After the first trade (5 Wood -> 2 Ore):\n   - Wood: 24 - 5 = 19\n   - Ore: 8 + 2 = 10\n   - The values of other resources remain unchanged.\n\n3.

However, let's adjust our strategy to make a more favorable trade.\n\nLet's directly evaluate what we can offer and request:\n- An alternative could be: `[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]` or similar, but let's directly check the value: Giving up 2 Wood (2*10 = 20) for 1 Brick (1*26 = 26) is beneficial.\n\nThus, a good trade could be: `[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n\nLet's go with this offer.\n\n### Next Action\n\n`[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]`",

      "response": "### Current State of Resources\n\nAfter the last turn, we need to update the state of resources for Player 0.\n\nInitially, Player 0 had:\n- Wheat: 7\n- Wood: 24\n- Sheep: 14\n- Brick: 16\n- Ore: 8\n\nChanges due to trades:\n1. Offered 5 Wood for 2 Ore: \n   - Wood: 24 - 5 = 19\n  : 8: 8 + 2 = 10\n2. Offered 3 Brick for 2 Sheep:\n   - Brick: 16 - 3 = 13\n   - Sheep: 14 + 2 = 16\n3. Offered 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep (rejected):\n   - No change\n4. Offered 5 Wood for 2 Ore:\n   - Wood: 19 - 5 = 14\n   - Ore: 10 + 2 = 12\n5. Offered 4 Wood for 1 Ore:\n   - Wood: 14 - 4 = 10\n   - Ore: 12 + 1 = 13\n\nCurrent state:\n- Wheat: 7\n- Wood: 10\n- Sheep: 16\n- Brick: 13\n- Ore: 13\n\n### Values of Current Resources\n\nLet's calculate the total value:\n- Wheat: 7 * 5 = 35\n- Wood: 10 * 10 = 100\n- Sheep: 16 * 18 = 288\n- Brick: 13 * 26 = 338\n- Ore: 13 * 35 = 455\n\nTotal value = 35 + 100 + 288 + 338 + 455 = 1216\n\n### Next Turn's Action\n\nTo decide the next action, we need to analyze the current state and think about a potentially beneficial trade. \n\nSince Player 1 has not made any new offers, we should consider making a new offer. \n\nLet's examine the resources and their values:\n- We have a significant amount of Sheep and Ore, which are relatively valuable.\n- We have a moderate amount of Brick.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some of our less valuable resources or those in abundance relative to their value, in exchange for resources that could increase our total value.\n\n### Potential Trade\n\nOne potential trade is to offer some Brick (since we still have 13, which is a considerable amount) for more Ore or other valuable resources. However, we already have a substantial amount of Ore.\n\nAnother potential trade is to offer some Wheat (the least valuable resource per unit we have) for something more valuable.\n\nLet's consider: [Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]\n\nSince Sheep is more valuable than Wheat, this could be a good trade. We have 7 Wheat, so offering 3 is reasonable.\n\n### Action for This Turn\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]",
