This means I want to trade away resources I value less for resources I value more.\nMy current value per unit:\n- Wheat: 6\n- Wood: 9\n- Sheep: 12\n- Brick: 22\n- Ore: 32\n\nI have a relatively good amount of Wheat and Wood. I have a medium amount of Ore. I have less Sheep and Brick. From a value perspective, Wheat and Wood are the lowest. Ore is the highest, followed by Brick, then Sheep.\n\nLet's try to trade away some Wheat or Wood for higher value resources like Brick or Ore. I have 17 Wheat and 23 Wood, which are quite a lot. 9 Brick and 19 Ore are decent, but more would be good. 7 Sheep is the lowest quantity I have, and its value is middle-of-the-road.\n\nI'll start with an offer to trade away Wood, as I have the most of it, and it's the second lowest value. I'll ask for Brick or Ore.\n\nTurn 1: [Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Brick] \nThis is trading 5*9=45 value for 2*22=44 value. This is almost a 1:1 value trade for me, so it's not ideal for increasing value directly, but it might be a good starting point if the opponent wants Wood and has Brick. I'm hoping to get ahead on value, so let me reconsider.\n\nI should aim for a trade where the value I receive is higher than the value I give up.\nLet's try to trade Wheat, as it has the lowest value.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 6 * 6 = 36\nValue requested: 1 * 32 = 32\nThis is a bad offer for me as I'm losing value. I need to get *more* value.\n\nLet's re-think the strategy. I want to increase my total value. This means I need to make trades where (Value of Requested Resources) > (Value of Offered Resources).\n\nLet's try to trade away low-value, high-quantity items (Wheat, Wood) for high-value items (Ore, Brick).\n\n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 4 Brick]\nValue offered: 10 * 9 = 90\nValue requested: 4 * 22 = 88\nStill not good enough.\n\nI need to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me in terms of value.\nLet's try trading away a large quantity of Wheat for a smaller quantity of Ore.\n\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 3 Ore]\nValue offered: 15 * 6 = 90\nValue requested: 3 * 32 = 96\nThis is a small gain for me (96-90=6). Let's try this as a starting point. It's a noticeable amount of Wheat, which I have plenty of.\n\n**My first offer for Turn 1:**\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 3 Ore]",
