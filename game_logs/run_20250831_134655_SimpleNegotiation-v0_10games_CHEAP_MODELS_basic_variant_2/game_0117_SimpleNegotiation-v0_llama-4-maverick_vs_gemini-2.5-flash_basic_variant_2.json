I will make an initial offer to start negotiations.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nTo start, I will offer resources that are less valuable per unit in exchange for more valuable ones. I can offer Wheat (Value: 5) and Wood (Value: 11) for more valuable resources.\n\nLet's offer 12 Wheat and 4 Wood for 2 Brick (Value: 20) and 1 Ore (Value: 37), as Brick and Ore are more valuable.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 12 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]`\n\nThis offer aims to exchange less valuable resources for more valuable ones, potentially increasing the total value of my resources.\n\n### Waiting for Response\n\nI will wait for the opponent's response to my offer. Based on their response, I will decide whether to accept, deny, or make a counteroffer in the next turn.",

This is bad for me.\nConsider offering: 5 Sheep (Value 85) -> 2 Ore (Value 66). Bad for me.\n\nI want to gain value.\nMy current total value: (7*6) + (6*8) + (24*17) + (23*25) + (8*33) = 42 + 48 + 408 + 575 + 264 = 1337\n\nLet's propose something where I get a higher value item for lower value items.\nWhat if I offer Wheat and Wood for Ore?\nI have 7 Wheat and 6 Wood.\nI want 1 Ore (Value 33).\nCan I offer less than 33 value?\n2 Wood (Value 16) + 1 Wheat (Value 6) = 22.

      "response": "## Step 1: Assess the current state of resources after the previous trades.\nAfter accepting the trade offer from Player 1, which was 3 Wood, 1 Wheat for 1 Ore, we need to update the resource quantities. Initially, we had: Wheat = 12, Wood = 8, Sheep = 25, Brick = 9, Ore = 19. After the trade: Wheat = 12 - 1 = 11, Wood = 8 + 3 = 11, Sheep = 25, Brick = 9, Ore = 19 + 1 = 20.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the last offers made and received.\nThe last trade offer made by Player 0 was: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick. The last trade offer received from Player 1 was: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick. We need to consider if these offers or any other potential trades could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the value of the resources.\nThe values are: Wheat = 5, Wood = 11, Sheep = 12, Brick = 20, Ore = 37. We should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but in a more favorable quantity.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the current resources and potential trades.\nCurrent resources: Wheat = 11, Wood = 11, Sheep = 25, Brick = 9, Ore = 20. Consider trading resources that are less valuable for more valuable ones. For example, trading Sheep (Value = 12) for Brick (Value = 20) is a good trade.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the offer from Player 1: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick.\nFor 2 Sheep (2 * 12 = 24), we get 1 Brick (1 * 20 = 20). This trade is not favorable because we're losing value (24 > 20).\n\n## Step 6: Decide on the next action based on the current situation and the offers.\nSince the last offer from Player 1 (2 Sheep -> 1 Brick) is not favorable, we should consider making a new offer. Let's think about trading Ore (high value) or other resources for something more valuable or needed.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a new trade offer.\nConsidering the values, trading Ore for Brick could be beneficial because both are relatively high in value, but Brick is less than Ore. However, we have a significant amount of Sheep. Let's directly compare values and consider a trade that could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 8: Make a new trade offer.\nLet's offer something that could be of interest to Player 1. We've got Ore and Sheep in considerable quantities. Offering Ore for Brick might not be favorable due to its high value, but we can still try. An alternative is to offer Sheep for Brick since it's a relatively good trade (Sheep = 12, Brick = 20).\n\n## Step 9: Choose a specific trade offer.\nLet's make an offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick. This is a simpler trade and could be more acceptable. The calculation is: losing 2 * 12 = 24 value for gaining 1 * 20 = 20 value. However, it's still not a good trade. Let's think about other combinations.\n\n## Step 10: Consider an alternative trade.\nAnother possible trade could involve Wood or Wheat, which are less valuable. However, we need to ensure the trade is beneficial. Let's directly propose a trade that we think could be accepted and is somewhat fair.\n\n## Step 11: Propose a new trade.\nLet's offer: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]. This translates to: giving up 1 Ore (Value = 37) for 2 Brick (Value = 2 * 20 = 40). This is a gain of 3 value units.\n\n## Step 12: Check if the proposed trade is within the limits of our resources.\nWe have 20 Ore, so giving 1 Ore is feasible. We need to check if Player 1 has enough Brick to offer 2 Brick.\n\n## Step 13: Format the trade offer according to the game's required format.\nThe offer is: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick].\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]}$",
