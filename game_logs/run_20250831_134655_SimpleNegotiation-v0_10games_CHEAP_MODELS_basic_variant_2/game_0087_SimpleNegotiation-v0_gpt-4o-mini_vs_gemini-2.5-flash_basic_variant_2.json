Offering 5 Wheat for 1 Brick would be a slight gain.\nLet's try to get more Brick for my Wheat.\n\nOption 2: Trade Wheat for Ore\nMy value of 1 Ore = 38.\nMy value of 1 Wheat = 6.\nMy 6 Wheat (6 * 6 = 36) is roughly equal to 1 Ore (38).\nOffering 6 Wheat for 1 Ore would be a slight gain.\n\nGiven that I have a good amount of Brick and Ore already, I could try to consolidate my high-value resources even further.\nThe opponent offered 4 Wheat + 3 Sheep for 2 Ore + 3 Brick. This indicates they also have Wheat and Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, as it's the highest value resource.\nI am relatively rich in Brick. Can I trade some Brick for Ore?\n1 Ore (38) is slightly more valuable than 1 Brick (29).\nIf I offer 2 Brick (2 * 29 = 58), what can I ask for?\nI can ask for 1 Ore (38) and some other resource, perhaps a Wood (9). That would be 47 value requested for 58 offered. Still a loss.\nIf I offer 2 Brick for 1 Ore. My 58 offered, opponent's 38 offered. This would be a loss for me.\n\nLet's stick to trading up. I have a lot of Wheat.\nLet's try to trade Wheat for Ore.\nOffer: 6 Wheat (6 * 6 = 36)\nRequest: 1 Ore (38)\nThis is a small gain for me (2 value).\n\nConsider the opponent's previous offer. They asked for Ore and Brick, suggesting they need these or want more of them.\nThey offered Wheat and Sheep. I have plenty of Wheat. Sheep is medium value (16).\n\nLet's try another offer to gain value.\nI have 20 Wheat and 24 Wood. These are my lowest value resources.\nLet's try to trade a combination of Wheat and Wood for a higher value resource like Brick or Ore.\n\nOffer: 2 Wood (2 * 9 = 18) + 2 Wheat (2 * 6 = 12) = 30\nRequest: 1 Brick (29)\nThis looks like a pretty even trade in terms of absolute value, giving me a small gain of 1. And it consolidates my small valuable items into a bigger one.\nIt also reduces my low-value resource count.\n\nI will try to make an offer.\nI'll try to trade up my less valuable resources (Wheat, Wood) for more valuable resources (Brick, Ore).\nMy current inventory has a healthy amount of Brick and Ore.\nI want to increase my overall value.\n\nLet's propose trading a combination of Wheat and Wood for Brick.\nI have an abundance of Brick.
