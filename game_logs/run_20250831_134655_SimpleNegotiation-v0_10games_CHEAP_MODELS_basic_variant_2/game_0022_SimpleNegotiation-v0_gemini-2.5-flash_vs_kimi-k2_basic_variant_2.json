History recap  \n- Turn 1: I accepted P0\u2019s 5 Wheat + 3 Wood for 1 Ore.  \n- Turn 2: I offered 3 Wood + 2 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick + 1 Ore \u2013 denied.  \n- Turn 3: P0 repeated the first deal \u2013 I denied.  \n- Turn 4: I offered 1 Ore \u2192 4 Brick + 2 Wheat \u2013 denied.  \n- Turn 5: no P0 offer. I repeated the 1 Ore demand \u2013 still denied.  \n(Six turns remain.)\n\n2. Value check  \n- After the one trade accepted, I lost 1 Ore (34 value), gained 5 Wheat (25) and 3 Wood (27).  \n  Net immediate value-change: \u20132.  \n- Looking forward, my comparative advantages/disadvantages are:  \n  \u2013 Heavily overstocked in Wheat & Wood (their per-unit value is low to me).  \n  \u2013 Low current Brick (I had 13 initially, gave none so far).  \n  \u2013 Ore is still my biggest value-per-item, but I can\u2019t afford to give more away at \u201c1 Ore for 8 value\u201d ratios as in the first trade.  \n  \u2013 Sheep (16 / unit) are mid-value but I offered 2 already and P0 refused, so he apparently values Brick & Ore higher.\n\n3. Strategy  \nI have to turn surplus low-value cards (especially Wheat) into higher-value cards (Brick, more Sheep, or small Ore amounts).  \nGiven P0 keeps demanding Ore, the only way he might ever accept is if the effective Ore/Brick ratio moves in his favour while keeping my Wheat/Brick conversion higher than Wheat\u2019s base value.\n\n4. Next offer  \nTherefore, I\u2019ll now offer surplus Wheat with a relatively small Ore sweetener in exchange for Brick since Brick has the highest gap for me (26 vs Wheat\u2019s 5). The ratio I push is still only ~9 value for 26 value, but with Ore as lure and Wheat duplication almost free for me, it should be clearer value for him than earlier Ore-only offers.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Ore -> 3 Brick, 1 Wheat]",
