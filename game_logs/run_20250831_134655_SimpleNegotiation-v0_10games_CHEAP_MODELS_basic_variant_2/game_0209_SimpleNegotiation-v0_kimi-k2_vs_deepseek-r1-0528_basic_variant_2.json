Similarly, trading **Ore for Sheep** (15) is extremely poor (40 \u2192 15), so I'd avoid that. Trading **Ore for Wood** (10) or **Wheat** (6) is even worse.\n\nHowever, Brick is quite valuable (29) and it's worth seeking, but only if I can obtain it at favorable ratios.\n\nI'll open by probing the other side for brick, aiming for a reasonable ratio (like 1 Ore for 1 Brick, or slightly better (but likely unrealistic)).\n\n[Offer: 3 Ore -> 1 Brick, 2 Wood]",

Since Ore trades haven't been successful, I'll shift strategy to target resources where we can gain value incrementally. \n\nWe have an abundance of Sheep (25) valued at ~0.8095 per unit, and Wheat (6) at 1.0 per unit\u2014a slight gap we can exploit. I propose trading Wheat for Sheep: giving 1 Wheat (valued at 1.0) for 2 Sheep (valued at ~1.619) would net us a gain of ~0.619 per Sheep received. This is small but positive, and Player 0 has engaged in Sheep trades before, making it reasonable.\n\n**[Offer: 1 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]**\n\nThis offer gives Player 0 Wheat\u2014a resource we have little of, potentially increasing its perceived value to them\u2014while securing a predictable gain for us.
