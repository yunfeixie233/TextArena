      "response": "- **Resources**:\n  - Wheat: 21 (Value: 6)\n  - Wood: 14 (Value: 9)\n  - Sheep: 10 (Value: 16)\n  - Brick: 11 (Value: 25)\n  - Ore: 11 (Value: 39)\n\n- **Goal**: Increase total resource value.\n\n- **Current Turn**: 1 of 10\n\nI need to make a trade offer that increases my total value. I have a lot of Wheat, which has a low value. Ore and Brick have high values. I want to trade my low-value resources for high-value resources.\n\nLet's calculate current total value:\n(21 * 6) + (14 * 9) + (10 * 16) + (11 * 25) + (11 * 39) = 126 + 126 + 160 + 275 + 429 = 1116\n\nI will offer Wheat for something more valuable like Brick or Ore. I have a lot of Wheat, so I can offer a good quantity.\n\nLet's try to get Brick or Ore.\n\nOffer 1: A significant amount of Wheat for some Brick.\nExample: [Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Brick]\nValue offered: 10 * 6 = 60\nValue requested: 3 * 25 = 75\nThis is a good trade for me, assuming the opponent has Brick and wants Wheat.\n\nLet's consider if I want to give up other resources. Sheep is mid-value. Wood is low-value.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix? Say, some Wheat and some Wood for Brick and Ore.\nMy current strategy is to offload my lowest value resources (Wheat and Wood) for my highest value (Brick and Ore).\n\nOffer 2: Larger quantity of Wheat for higher value resources.\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 3 Ore]\nValue offered: 15 * 6 = 90\nValue requested: 3 * 39 = 117\nThis is also a good value trade for me.\n\nLet's look at my quantities. I have 21 Wheat. I can definitely spare 15.\n\nOkay, my first offer will be straightforward: trade my lowest value, high quantity resource (Wheat) for a high-value resource (Ore).\n\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\nValue offered: 15 * 6 = 90\nValue requested: 2 * 39 = 78\nThis is not good for me as it reduces my value. Let's aim for a value increase.\n\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 3 Ore]\nValue offered: 15 * 6 = 90\nValue requested: 3 * 39 = 117\nThis is a good trade proposal: +27 value.\n\nLet's check other options. What if I try to get Brick, which is slightly less valuable than Ore, but I have a decent amount of it already.\n\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 5 Brick]\nValue offered: 15 * 6 = 90\nValue requested: 5 * 25 = 125\nThis is an even better trade proposal: +35 value.\n\nI think targeting Brick is a good starting point, as it's valuable but perhaps not as critical as Ore for some strategies. I have 11 Brick, so getting more could give me a stronger position in the medium-value tier.\n\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 5 Brick]",

If I offer 10 Wheat, I will still have 11 Wheat left.\nThe value of 10 Wheat is 10 * 6 = 60.\nThe value of 2 Brick is 2 * 25 = 50.\nThis is still a loss for me. I need to be more aggressive in acquiring higher value resources if I am trading away lower value ones.\n\nLet's reconsider what Player 1 offered: 3 Brick for 15 Wheat. This values 1 Brick at 5 Wheat.\nI need to make an offer where I get more value than I give.\n\nI have a decent amount of Wheat. I could use more Brick, Sheep, or Ore.\nPlayer 1 rejected my previous offer of 10 Wheat for 3 Brick. My offer valued 1 Brick at 3.33 Wheat.\nPlayer 1's offer valued 1 Brick at 5 Wheat.
