      "response": "Based on the trade activities so far, here\u2019s a summary of my resources and values after the accepted trade:\n\n### Resources Summary\n\n**Initial Resources:**\n- Wheat: 13 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 22 (Value: 12)\n- Sheep: 11 (Value: 18)\n- Brick: 25 (Value: 23)\n- Ore: 17 (Value: 34)\n\n**After Accepting Trade from Player 1:**\n- **Received:** 4 Brick, 2 Ore\n- **Offered:** 5 Wood, 3 Wheat\n\n### Updated Resources:\n- Wheat: 13 - 3 = 10 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 22 - 5 = 17 (Value: 12)\n- Sheep: 11 (Value: 18)\n- Brick: 25 + 4 = 29 (Value: 23)\n- Ore: 17 + 2 = 19 (Value: 34)\n\n### Total Values Calculation\n- Total Value before trade: \n  - Wheat: 78\n  - Wood: 204\n  - Sheep: 198\n  - Brick: 645\n  - Ore: 646\n  \n  **Total Initial Value = 78 + 204 + 198 + 645 + 646 = 1771**\n\n- Total Value after trade:\n  - Wheat: 60 (10 * 6)\n  - Wood: 204 (17 * 12)\n  - Sheep: 198 (11 * 18)\n  - Brick: 667 (29 * 23)\n  - Ore: 646 (19 * 34)\n  \n  **Total New Value = 60 + 204 + 198 + 667 + 646 = 1775**\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total value has increased from 1771 to 1775. \n\n### Next Step\nI need to make another offer to Player 1. Since I still have a good quantity of resources, I can look to leverage either my excess Wheat or Wood for more valuable resources like Ore or Brick that are harder to come by.\n\nFor my next trade, I\u2019ll propose a trade that aims to exchange a substantial amount of one resource for a combination of useful resources. \n\n### New Offer\nI propose: \n- **[Offer: 6 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 5 Brick, 2 Ore]**\n\nThis offer targets high-value exchanges and aims to further boost my overall resource value. \n\nLet's send this proposal. \n\n**Action:** \n- [Offer: 6 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 5 Brick, 2 Ore]",
