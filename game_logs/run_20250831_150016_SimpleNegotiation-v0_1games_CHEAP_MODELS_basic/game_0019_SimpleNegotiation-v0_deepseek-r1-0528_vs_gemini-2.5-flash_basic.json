I rejected this as it's a very good deal for them and not for me.\nI have a lot of Sheep and Brick. Sheep is my least valuable resource (13). Brick is next lowest (29).\nPlayer 0 has rejected my previous offer of 3 Sheep for 1 Ore. I will try to offer them something they might want more.\n\nLet's try to get rid of some Sheep and Brick, which are lower value, for something more valuable.\nGiven that Player 0 keeps offering for Ore, I will continue to leverage that.\n\nMy resources are:\nWheat: 10 (Value: 60)\nWood: 9 (Value: 81)\nSheep: 20 (Value: 260)\nBrick: 21 (Value: 609)\nOre: 21 (Value: 714)\nTotal Value: 1724\n\nPlayer 0 offered 4 Brick (value 116) and 1 Wood (value 9) which totals 125.

Maybe Player 0 has Wheat or Wood they want to get rid of, or maybe they have some Ore.\nI will try to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me and still attractive to Player 0 if they really want Ore.\n\nIf I offer 3 Brick (value 87) for 1 Ore (value 34). This gives me a good gain of 53 value. Player 0 rejected the last offer of 2 Ore for 4 Brick, 1 Wood (where Player 0 got 2 Ore valued at 68 for 125 worth of goods).\n\nI will propose an offer that is slightly less in value for them, but still gives me some good value.\nI have plenty of Brick and Ore.\nLet's try to offer a quantity of my resources that are lower value, for a quantity of one of their higher valued resources or to continue leveraging their apparent desire for Ore.\n\nI have 20 Sheep. Sheep is only 13 value.\nI have 21 Brick. Brick is 29 value.\n\nPlayer 0 has previously offered 12 Wood for 3 Ore (accepted by me). This means they value Ore highly.\nLet's make an offer where I give up a lower valued resource for a higher valued one.\nI have a lot of Brick. Let's offer some Brick for Ore.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (value 87) for 1 Ore (value 34), it's a massive win for me. They would never accept.\n\nI have 21 Ore. I can afford to trade some Ore for better value.\nI will try to get rid of Sheep, my lowest value resource.\nI will try to trade 3 Sheep (value 39) for 1 Wood (value 9). That's not a good trade for me.\n\nLet's rethink. Player 0 has been making offers for Ore. I accepted one of their offers where I received 12 Wood for 3 Ore, which was beneficial to me. Then I rejected their later offer of 4 Brick, 1 Wood for 2 Ore, as it was not beneficial for me.\n\nI want to make an offer that player 0 might accept, and that increases my total value.\nSince Player 0 is clearly interested in Ore, I can offer Ore but demand much more in return.\nOr I can try to get something valuable for my lower-value resources.\n\nHow about offering something that I have a lot of, and is low in value, such as Sheep, for something more valuable?\nI have 20 Sheep.\nIf I offer 5 Sheep (value 65) for 1 Ore (value 34). This is good for me. Player 0 might accept if they are very low on Sheep or very high on Ore.\n\nLet's try to offer them something they previously showed interest in giving out. They offered 12 Wood for 3 Ore. This suggests they have Wood they are willing to trade.\nI have 9 Wood.

      "response": "After reviewing the trade history and current resource valuations, I aim to maximize my total value. My resources are now: Wheat (5, value 6), Wood (13, value 9), Sheep (5, value 14), Brick (18, value 30), and Ore (18, value 38). Ore provides the highest per-unit value (38), making it a priority for acquisition, while Brick is also valuable (30). Previous attempts to trade Wood for Ore had mixed success (one accepted, two rejected), and offers involving multiple resources were ineffective.\n\nA direct swap of Brick for Ore at a 1:1 ratio is highly advantageous to me. Trading 3 Brick for 3 Ore offers:\n- Value given: 3 \u00d7 30 = 90\n- Value received: 3 \u00d7 38 = 114\n- Net gain: 24\n\nThis trade leverages my ample Brick supply (18) to secure high-value Ore, with minimal risk of value loss. I offer:\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 3 Ore]",
