      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to analyze my current holdings and identify potential trades that could be beneficial.\n\n1. **Current Holdings and Value**:\n   - Wheat: 10 units @ 5 value/unit = 50 value\n   - Wood: 19 units @ 8 value/unit = 152 value\n   - Sheep: 19 units @ 16 value/unit = 304 value\n   - Brick: 20 units @ 22 value/unit = 440 value\n   - Ore: 25 units @ 38 value/unit = 950 value\n\n   Total Value = 50 + 152 + 304 + 440 + 950 = 1896 value\n\n2. **Identifying Potential Trades**:\n   To increase my total value, I should look to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values if possible. However, I need to be cautious and consider what my opponent might be willing to accept or offer.\n\n3. **Initial Strategy**:\n   - I'm relatively rich in Ore (high value) and Brick (moderately high value), so I might look to trade some of these for other resources if it seems beneficial.\n   - I'm not extremely low on any resource, so I'll be selective about my trades.\n\n4. **First Turn Offer**:\n   Let's examine potential trades. If I can get a good deal, I'll offer it. For instance, if I can trade a resource for something of higher total value, it's a good start.\n\n   Considering the values:\n   - Trading some Ore (38 value/unit) for a resource that is relatively valuable could be a good start if the rate is favorable.\n\nLet's start by making an offer that might be attractive to the opponent and potentially beneficial or neutral for me. \n\nSince I have a lot of Ore and Brick, let's try to offer some of these and see if we can get a good deal.\n\n`[Offer: 2 Ore, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore, 2 Wood]` is not a great example because I'm giving up (2*38 + 22) = 98 for (1*38 + 2*8) = 54, which is not beneficial.\n\nLet's think of a more balanced example or simply wait for an opponent's offer.\n\nLet's send a message to initiate: `[Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 3 Sheep]` is an example, but it doesn't seem immediately attractive as I'm giving up (1*16 + 2*8) = 32 for (3*16) = 48, which is a gain, but not huge, and might not be attractive to the opponent.\n\nLet's actually start with: `[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis implies giving up (2*22) = 44 value for (1*38) = 38 value, which isn't beneficial for me. So, let's not do that.\n\nLet's rethink and directly propose something that looks beneficial or at least test the waters.\n\n`[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick]` could be a potential starting point. Here, I'm giving (1*38) = 38 for (1*16 + 1*22) = 38. This is not a bad trade in terms of value but let's see if it's attractive to the opponent.\n\nLet's go with: `[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick]`\n\nTo follow the required format, here is my action:\n\n`[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick]`",
