Player 0 seems to undervalue Wheat or overvalue Brick.\n\nI'm looking to increase my total resource value. Brick and Ore have the highest individual value, so I want to acquire more of those if possible, or trade less valuable resources for them. Wheat, Wood, and Sheep are good to trade away if I get a good return.\n\nPlayer 0 rejected 12 Wheat for 3 Brick.\n12 Wheat is worth 12 * 5 = 60.\n3 Brick is worth 3 * 28 = 84.\nThis was a good offer for me.\n\nPlayer 0 offered 2 Brick for 12 Wheat.\n2 Brick is worth 2 * 28 = 56.\n12 Wheat is worth 12 * 5 = 60.\nThis was a bad offer for me.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore. Player 0 might have a lot of Wheat or Wood they want to trade away.\n\nStrategy: Offer a reasonable amount of less valuable resources for a higher value resource like Ore or Brick, trying to ensure the value I receive is higher than what I give.\n\nAttempt 1: Trade Wheat for Ore.\nOffer: 10 Wheat (value 50) -> 2 Ore (value 72). This is a good deal for me.\nThis might be too big a jump given the previous rejections.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood for Ore or Brick. Wood is my second lowest value resource.\nOffer: 3 Wood (value 33) -> 1 Brick (value 28). This is a bad deal for me.\nOffer: 4 Wood (value 44) -> 1 Brick (value 28). This is a bad deal for me.\nOffer: 5 Wood (value 55) -> 2 Brick (value 56). This is a fair deal, slightly in my favor.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick for Wheat, but be more conservative.\nPlayer 0 rejected 12 Wheat for 3 Brick.\n\nLet's try a small trade to see if Player 0 wants to engage.\nHow about 5 Wheat for 1 Brick?\n5 Wheat Value = 25\n1 Brick Value = 28\nThis is slightly in my favor.\n\nIf Player 0 is not interested in trading Brick for Wheat, then I should try another resource.\n\nWhat if Player 0 wants Wheat? Maybe they are trying to get a good deal on Wheat.\nThey offered 2 Brick for 12 Wheat (56 for 60).\n\nMy offer of 12 Wheat for 3 Brick (60 for 84) was good for me.\n\nLet's try to acquire Ore. I have 5 Ore, which is not a lot.\nHow about trading Wheat for Ore?\nOffer: 10 Wheat (value 50) -> 1 Ore (value 36). This is bad for me.\nOffer: 10 Wheat (value 50) -> 2 Ore (value 72). This is good for me. This might be too much for Player 0.\n\nLet's try trading Sheep for Ore or Brick. Sheep is a moderate resource for me.\nOffer: 3 Sheep (value 36) -> 1 Ore (value 36). This is a fair trade.\n\nGiven the previous rejections, I should probably stick to a small, slightly favorable trade to test the waters.\nI will try to trade Wheat for Brick again, but with a different quantity.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Brick]\nMy value: 6 * 5 = 30\nRequested value: 2 * 28 = 56\nThis is a very good deal for me. Player 0 will likely reject this.\n\nLet's try something more balanced, but still slightly favorable to me.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Brick]\nMy value: 10 * 5 = 50\nRequested value: 3 * 28 = 84\nThis is still a good deal for me, but maybe more palatable than my previous 12 Wheat for 3 Brick (60 vs 84) due to smaller quantity.\n\nLet's rethink based on Player 0's actions. Player 0 offered 2 Brick -> 12 Wheat.\nValue: 56 -> 60. Player 0 wanting 12 Wheat.\nThey seem to have a lot of Brick and want Wheat.\nI need Brick.\n\nHow about I offer a smaller quantity of Wheat for a smaller quantity of Brick?\nSomething that makes me feel like I am winning.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Brick]\nMy value: 5 * 5 = 25\nRequested value: 2 * 28 = 56\nThis feels too greedy.\n\nLet's try to negotiate back on Player 0's offer of 2 Brick for 12 Wheat.\nI rejected it because 56 for 60 is bad for me.\n\nWhat if I counter Player 0's offer with something Player 0 might like, but is also favorable to me?\nThey want 12 Wheat. What would I give for 12 Wheat?\nIf I offer 3 Brick -> 12 Wheat, they rejected it.\n\nLet's try 11 Wheat for 3 Brick.\n11 Wheat = 55\n3 Brick = 84\nThis is even better for me than my original 12 Wheat for 3 Brick. Player 0 will probably reject.\n\nI need to make a trade that Player 0 accepts.\nIf I accept Player 0's offer of 2 Brick -> 12 Wheat, I lose 4 in value.\nPlayer 0: 2 Brick (56) for 12 Wheat (60). (Good for P0, bad for me)\nIf I accept, my resources become: Wheat 13-12=1, Wood 8, Sheep 7, Brick 13+2=15, Ore 5. Total Value: 777 (from 781). This is a loss.\n\nI want to increase my value.\n\nLet's offer a trade where I give slightly more value away, but I get a resource I want.\nSuppose I want to acquire Ore.\nOffer: 4 Sheep (48) -> 1 Ore (36). Bad for me.\nOffer: 3 Wood (33) -> 1 Ore (36). Good for me. This is a small trade that might go through.\nMy Wood count is 8. I can spare some.\n\nLet's try this. It's a clear win for me, but a small quantity.\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
