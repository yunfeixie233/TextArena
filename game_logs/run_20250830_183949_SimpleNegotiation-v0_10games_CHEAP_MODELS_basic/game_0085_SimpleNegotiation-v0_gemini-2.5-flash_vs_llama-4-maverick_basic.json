If I offer 2 Ore, that's 76 value. I need at least that in return.\n\nLet's check if I can propose a trade to gain more valuable resources or a significant quantity.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Ore -> 4 Brick]' would be a potential trade since 4 Brick = 4 * 20 = 80, which is more than 76.\n\nTherefore, a beneficial trade could be: \n'[Offer: 2 Ore -> 4 Brick]'",
