This was rejected.\n  - The total value of offered items is 3 * 10 = 30.\n  - The total value of requested items is 1 * 40 = 40.\n  - The value gain for Player 1 is 40 - 30 = 10.\n\nPlayer 1 has been consistently making offers where they gain value. Player 0 has rejected all offers. This suggests that Player 0 might not see enough value in the trades from their perspective, or they might not have the resources Player 1 is requesting.\n\nLet's try to offer something Player 0 might find more appealing while still making a good profit for Player 1.\nPlayer 1 needs to consider what resources Player 0 might value more or be short on, given that Player 0 previously offered Brick and Wheat for Wood. This might suggest Player 0 wants Wood, or that they have plenty of Brick and Wheat.\n\nPlayer 1's highest value resources are Ore and Brick. Player 1's lowest value resource is Wheat.\nPlayer 1 should try to trade away lower-value resources for higher-value resources.\n\nCurrent resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 16   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 12   Value: 10\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 14   Value: 12\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 9    Value: 29\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 22   Value: 40\n\nLet's try to offer a smaller amount of a valuable resource like Wood or Sheep for highly valued Ore or Brick, or a combination. The previous offers were good for Player 1, so Player 0 is likely looking for a better deal or doesn't have the requested items.\n\nPlayer 0's previous rejected offer was: \"Offered items: 10 Brick, 5 Wheat -> Requested items: 8 Wood\". This means Player 0 wanted Wood and was willing to give Brick and Wheat. This suggests Player 0 might have an abundance of Brick and Wheat and a need for Wood.\n\nPlayer 1 has 12 Wood. Player 1 could fulfil Player 0's need for Wood and gain some value.\n\nIf Player 0 is willing to give 10 Brick (290 value) and 5 Wheat (25 value) for 8 Wood (80 value), this means Player 0 valued 8 Wood at 315. That is a very high perceived value for 8 Wood.\n\nGiven Player 0's previous offer, Player 1 can offer Wood.\n\nLet's try to offer Wood for Ore or Brick at a ratio favorable to Player 1, but less aggressive than the previous offers.\n\nProposed offer: Offer 4 Wood (Value 40) for 1 Ore (Value 40). This is a 1:1 value trade if accepted. Player 1 gains 0 value, but it might be accepted as it is fair.\nIf Player 0 truly needs Wood, they might accept this. Player 1 has 12 Wood, so losing 4 is fine.\n\nHowever, Player 1's goal is to increase total value, so a 1:1 value trade is not ideal unless it's to facilitate future trades.\n\nLet's try another approach based on Player 0's needs. Player 0 wants Wood. Player 1 wants Ore or Brick.\n\nConsider selling Wood to Player 0 for a profit.\nIf Player 0 offered 10 Brick (290) and 5 Wheat (25) for 8 Wood (80), it means Player 0 is willing to pay high for Wood.\n\nLet's try to sell Wood for some Brick, as Player 0 seems to have Brick.\nOffer 3 Wood (Value 30) for 2 Brick (Value 58). Player 1 gains 28 value. This is a good gain for Player 1.\nThis trade is also beneficial for Player 0 if they value Wood as much as their previous offer suggests.\nFor Player 0, 3 Wood (30 value) for 2 Brick (58 value). Player 0 loses 28 value. This is a negative for player 0 in terms of value.\n\nLet's try an offer that creates some value for player 0 as well. A win-win.\nPlayer 0 offered 10 Brick + 5 Wheat for 8 Wood. Player 0 values Wood very highly.\n\nLet's try to offer Wood and ask for Ore, possibly also offering some Wheat or Sheep to make it more appealing to Player 0 if they have a need for those.\n\nLet's rethink: Player 1 has tried to sell Wood and Sheep for Ore and Brick. All rejected.\nPlayer 0 has tried to give Brick and Wheat for Wood. Rejected by Player 1.\n\nMaybe Player 0 simply doesn't have Ore, so Player 1's requests for Ore are impossible.\nLet's try to get Brick. Player 0 offered Brick.\n\nHow about offering something Player 1 has in abundance (Wheat) for something valuable?\nOffer 5 Wheat (Value 25) for 1 Brick (Value 29). Value gain: 4. This is a small gain but might be more acceptable if Player 0 has too much Brick and needs Wheat or just generally wants to diversify or get rid of it.\n\nGiven Player 0's history, Player 0 is likely to reject offers that result in a value loss for them.\nPlayer 0 made an offer of 10 Brick and 5 Wheat for 8 Wood. If Player 0 accepted that, their value for the 8 Wood was 315. Our system values 8 Wood at 80. Player 0 has a very different valuation.\n\nLet's try to exploit Player 0's high valuation of Wood.\nPlayer 1 has 12 Wood. Player 1's value is 10/unit.\nPlayer 0 offered 10 Brick (290) + 5 Wheat (25) = 315 for 8 Wood (80).\nThis means Player 0 values 1 Wood at 315/8 = 39.375.\nPlayer 1 buys Wood at 10. So if Player 1 can sell Wood at 39.375 per unit, it's a huge profit.\n\nPlayer 1 wants to gain value, and Player 0 seems to need Wood.\nLet's offer 5 Wood (Value 50 for Player 1) for something that brings Player 1 more value.\nIf Player 0 values 1 Wood at ~39, then 5 Wood for Player 0 is roughly 195.\nPlayer 1 wants to get something worth more than 50 in return.\n\nPlayer 1 could ask for 1 Ore (40) + 1 Brick (29) = 69.\nOffer: 5 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick\nValue for P1: Offer 50, Request 69. Gain 19.\nValue for P0 if they value Wood at 39.375: Offer (-5 * 39.375) = -196.875. Request (40 + 29) = 69. Gain 69 - 196.875 = -127.875. Still a huge loss for P0 based on our calculation.\n\nThis is difficult because Player 0's valuations are extremely high for Wood.\n\nLet's try to make an offer that feels \"fair\" to Player 0 from their perspective, while still gaining value for Player 1.\nIf Player 0 is willing to give up 10 Brick (290) and 5 Wheat (25) for 8 Wood (80), that's a total outgoing value of 315 for Player 0 to get 80 value for Player 1.\nThis suggests Player 0 is willing to lose a lot of value in absolute terms, if they get Wood.\n\nLet's try to offer 3 Wood (Value 30 for Player 1) and request 1 Brick (Value 29) and 1 Wheat (Value 5).\nOffer: 3 Wood (30) -> 1 Brick (29) + 1 Wheat (5) = 34.\nP1 gain: 4.\nFor P0 (using their estimated high Wood value of 39.375/unit):\nOffer: (-3 * 39.375) = -118.125.\nRequest: (29 + 5) = 34.\nP0 Loss: 34 - 118.125 = -84.125 (bad for P0).\n\nThis is tough. Player 0 has rejected all of P1's offers and P1 has rejected Player 0's offer too.\nThe game is stuck because Player 0 seems to be valuing items very differently and aggressively.\n\nLet's go for a small, definite profit while also including materials Player 0 seems to have (Brick) or might need (Wood).\nLet's try to shift low value Wheat for high value Brick.\n\nOffer 5 Wheat (value 25) for 1 Brick (value 29). P1 gains 4.\nThis is a small gain, but it's a straight swap of a low quantity of low value item for a high value item. Player 0 has shown to have Brick.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nThe opponent has rejected several offers, so Player 1 should try to make an offer that seems fair or beneficial to the opponent as well, while still letting Player 1 gain value.\nPlayer 0 has revealed a perceived need for Wood.\n\nLet's make an offer involving Wood. If Player 0 values Wood highly, then offering Wood is a good strategy.\nOffer 4 Wood (value 40) for 1 Ore (value 40). This is a 0 gain. Not good enough.\n\nHow about 3 Wood (30) for 1 Ore (40)? P1 gain 10.\nThis has been rejected before.\n\nWhat if Player 1 focuses on simplifying the offer?\nPlayer 0 offered 10 Brick and 5 Wheat for 8 Wood. This implies Player 0 has excess Brick and Wheat and needs Wood.\n\nPlayer 1 wants Ore or Brick.\nLet's try to sell Wood for Ore or Brick.\n\nOffer: 4 Wood (Value 40) -> 1 Brick (Value 29) + 1 Sheep (Value 12) = 41.\nP1 gain 1. Not much, but the trade is very slightly in P1's favor and P0 might accept if they want the Wood and don't value Sheep and Brick highly.\n\nLet's try a different angle. What Player 0 might need that Player 1 has?\nMaybe Player 0 has a surplus of Ore and needs Sheep or Wheat. No information on that.\n\nLet's try to sell Player 0 some Wood, which they want, and get some Ore, which is high value.\nPlayer 1 needs to consider how to make the offer appealing to Player 0, who seems to value Wood highly based on their initial offer.\n\nIf Player 0 is willing to give up 315 value for 80 value of wood, then offering 3 Wood (value 30) for 1 Ore (value 40) might be a good deal for Player 0 too in perceived value, even though Player 1 gains 10 value.\n3 Wood Player 0 value: 3 * 39.375 = 118.125.\n1 Ore Player 0 value: Our value is 40. Player 0 must value it less for this trade to be good for them.\n\nThis negotiation is difficult because of the apparent differences in valuation. Player 0's rejections suggest they are not getting a good deal from their perspective, even though Player 1's offers consistently provide value gain for Player 1.\n\nLet's offer a trade that involves a net loss for Player 0 by Player 1's valuation, but which may be considered favorable for Player 0 due to their peculiar valuations (especially for Wood).\n\nOffer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore (P1 gains 10). If Player 0 wants Wood, this is a reasonable offer. This offer was previously rejected.\n\nWhat if Player 1 trades a little of high-value items for a lot of a low-value item? No, Player 1 wants to increase value.\n\nLet's try to be less greedy with the profit.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (Value 25) for 1 Brick (Value 29). Profit of 4.\nThis is a small profit, but it's a direct upgrade from a low-value item to a high-value item, and Player 0 has previously shown they have Brick.\n\nLet's try to make an offer that is very appealing if Player 0 needs Wood.\nOffer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore\nP1 offers: 2*10 + 2*5 = 20 + 10 = 30.\nP1 requests: 1*40 = 40.\nP1 gain: 10.\nThis puts more items on offer by Player 1, including Wheat, which Player 0 also seemed willing to trade.\nThis is a reasonable profit for Player 1, and offers two resources for one and the valuable Wood.\n\nLet's make this offer: [Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
