      "response": "Attempting to reconstruct my own ledger from the two earlier accepted offers, I now know:\n- My first huge trade (8 Sheep + 7 Ore for 13 Brick + 6 Wood) went through.  \n- My second small trade (5 Brick for 1 Ore + 1 Sheep) went through.  \n- My third trade (6 Wood + 5 Brick for 1 Sheep + 1 Ore) also went through.\n\nStacking those three trades on top of my starting inventory:\n\nStart:  \n25 Wheat, 15 Wood, 8 Sheep, 13 Brick, 7 Ore\n\nAfter trade 1 (8 Sheep, 7 Ore \u2192 13 Brick, 6 Wood):  \n25 Wheat, 15+6=21 Wood, 8-8=0 Sheep, 13+13=26 Brick, 7-7=0 Ore\n\nAfter trade 2 (5 Brick \u2192 1 Ore, 1 Sheep):  \n25 Wheat, 21 Wood, 0+1=1 Sheep, 26-5=21 Brick, 0+1=1 Ore\n\nAfter trade 3 (6 Wood, 5 Brick \u2192 1 Sheep, 1 Ore):  \n25 Wheat, 21-6=15 Wood, 1+1=2 Sheep, 21-5=16 Brick, 1+1=2 Ore\n\nCurrent inventories (per-unit values kept in mind):  \nWheat 5, Wood 8, Sheep 18, Brick 21, Ore 36  \nCurrent portfolio value = 25\u00b75 + 15\u00b78 + 2\u00b718 + 16\u00b721 + 2\u00b736 = 713\n\nTurn 10 (the final turn) has just opened and no offer has yet been made by either side.  I want to squeeze out one more small gain if possible, and this seems to be the only chance.\n\nI still have spare quantities:  \n- 25 Wheat (low value, good to offload)  \n- 15 Wood (good candidate too)  \n- 16 Brick (nice to trim if the return is Ore/Sheep)  \nwhereas Sheep 2 and Ore 2 are super-high value assets I don\u2019t wish to part with.\n\nProposing a small, attractive-to-them trade: offer 12 Brick (only 12 of my 16) for their 3 Ore.  They get 12\u00d721 = 252 value and give up 3\u00d736 = 108 value: on raw numbers it\u2019s sweet for them, and it\u2019ll let me convert one more batch of Brick into the Ore that I prize.\n\n[Offer: 12 Brick -> 3 Ore]",
