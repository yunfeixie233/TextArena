Since I don't know Player 1's resource valuations, I need to adjust my strategy to make this trade more appealing.  \n\nMy goal is to increase my total value, and Ore is the most valuable resource for me at 32 per unit. I still have a surplus of Wood (24 units, value 10 each) and Sheep (17 units, value 17 each), so I can afford to offer more Wood while reducing the demand on Ore to a more manageable 4 units. This new offer gives up Wood, which has lower personal value to me, while gaining Ore.\n\nHere's the breakdown of my proposed trade:  \n- **Offering**: 10 Wood and 1 Sheep \u2192 My cost: (10 \u00d7 10) + (1 \u00d7 17) = 100 + 17 = 117  \n- **Requesting**: 4 Ore \u2192 My gain: 4 \u00d7 32 = 128  \n- **Net value impact for me**: 128 \u2212 117 = +11 (a modest but positive gain)  \n\nI hope Player 1 sees this as a fair exchange, especially if they have excess Ore but need Wood or Sheep for their own goals.

      "response": "After reviewing our trade history and current resources, I've crafted an offer that benefits both parties. I'm offering resources that are abundant for me in exchange for Ore, which holds higher value. This trade will help balance our resource distributions effectively.\n\n**Updated resources after last trade:**\n- Wheat: 6 (Value: 5 each)\n- Wood: 19 (Value: 10 each)\n- Sheep: 15 (Value: 17 each)\n- Brick: 22 (Value: 24 each)\n- Ore: 8 (Value: 32 each)\n\n**Proposed Trade Rationale:**  \nI'm offering Wood and Sheep (which I have in surplus) for Ore (your higher-value resource). This exchange maintains mutual benefit while aligning with our previous successful trades involving Wood/Sheep for Ore. The quantities are calibrated based on our trade history to ensure fairness.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 4 Ore]",
