      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, I start by analyzing the resources and their values:\n\n- Wheat: Qty = 8, Value = 5\n- Wood: Qty = 11, Value = 10\n- Sheep: Qty = 22, Value = 14\n- Brick: Qty = 18, Value = 20\n- Ore: Qty = 8, Value = 33\n\nThe total value of my current resources is calculated as follows:\n- Total Value = (8 * 5) + (11 * 10) + (22 * 14) + (18 * 20) + (8 * 33)\n- Total Value = 40 + 110 + 308 + 360 + 264\n- Total Value = 1082\n\n### Negotiation Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I need to negotiate trades that result in acquiring resources of higher total value than what I offer. Given the current distribution and values, I should look to trade resources that are abundant and of lower value for those that are scarce and of higher value.\n\n### Initial Offer\n\nSince Ore has the highest value per unit and I have a relatively small quantity of it, I should aim to retain or gain more Ore. Conversely, I have a significant quantity of Sheep, which, while valuable, is not the highest value per unit. \n\nI will make an initial offer to trade some of my Sheep for more Ore, as Ore is highly valued and I have a limited quantity. Here's a potential trade:\n\n- I have 22 Sheep and will offer some for Ore.\n- Let's propose: '[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis offer is reasonable as it doesn't overly deplete my Sheep resources and could potentially be attractive to my opponent if they have Ore to spare.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\nSince there's no incoming offer at the start, I will make the offer as per my strategy.\n\nAction: `[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's see how the opponent responds.",

      "response": "Since the response format is required and the task involves continuing the negotiation game, let's analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Initially, you had: \n     - Wheat: 8 (Value: 5)\n     - Wood: 11 (Value: 10)\n     - Sheep: 22 (Value: 14)\n     - Brick: 18 (Value: 20)\n     - Ore: 8 (Value: 33)\n   - After the trades:\n     - You gave away: 4 Sheep + 2 Wood and received 2 Ore in the first accepted trade.\n     - You gave away: 2 Brick and received 1 Ore in the second accepted trade.\n   - New quantities:\n     - Wheat: 8\n     - Wood: 9\n     - Sheep: 18\n     - Brick: 16\n     - Ore: 11\n\n2. **Game State:**\n   - Turn count is not directly provided, but based on the history, we've had at least 5 turns (since there were previous offers and rejections).\n   - The last action was an accepted trade offer from Player0 to Player1.\n\n3. **Next Action:**\n   To maximize the value, we should look for trades that increase our total value. We have:\n   - Total initial value = (8*5) + (11*10) + (22*14) + (18*20) + (8*33) = 40 + 110 + 308 + 360 + 264 = 1082\n   - After the trades, our value = (8*5) + (9*10) + (18*14) + (16*20) + (11*33) = 40 + 90 + 252 + 320 + 363 = 1065\n   \n   It seems there was a miscalculation in the values after trades, as we actually increased our Ore quantity, which is valuable. Let's correct this:\n   - Before trades: Ore = 8*33 = 264\n   - After trades: Ore = 11*33 = 363, which is correct.\n   - The actual calculation should consider the items traded:\n     - Gave away: 2 Wood (2*10 = 20), 4 Sheep (4*14 = 56), 2 Brick (2*20 = 40)\n     - Received: 2 Ore (2*33 = 66)\n     - Net change in the first accepted trade = 66 - (20 + 56) = -10\n     - Then, gave away 2 Brick (2*20 = 40) and received 1 Ore (1*33 = 33)\n     - Net change in the second accepted trade = 33 - 40 = -7\n   \n   The total decrease = -10 (first trade) - 7 (second trade) = -17. So, our total value after trades = 1082 - 17 = 1065, which matches the initial intuition but is based on correct calculations.\n\n4. **Making the Next Offer:**\n   Given the current state, we should look for opportunities to gain more value. One potential trade could involve offering resources that are less valuable to us for more valuable ones or maintaining a good balance.\n\nLet's directly consider a potential trade offer. Since we have a good amount of Sheep and have reduced our Brick quantity, we could think of making an offer that involves these.\n\nPotential Offer: `[Offer:4 Sheep -> 2 Brick]`\n\nThis means we are willing to give away 4 Sheep for 2 Brick.\n\nLet's format the response as per the required action tokens:\n\n`[Offer:4 Sheep ->2 Brick]`",

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the current state of the game and the resources.\n\nInitially, Player 0 had:\n- Wheat: 8 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 11 (Value: 10)\n- Sheep: 22 (Value: 14)\n- Brick: 18 (Value: 20)\n- Ore: 8 (Value: 33)\n\nAfter the trades:\n1. Offered: 2 Wood, 4 Sheep -> Requested: 2 Ore (Accepted)\n   - Wood: 11 - 2 = 9\n   - Sheep: 22 - 4 = 18\n   - Ore: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n2. Offered: 2 Brick -> Requested: 1 Ore (Accepted)\n   - Brick: 18 - 2 = 16\n   - Ore: 10 + 1 = 11\n\nCurrent state:\n- Wheat: 8\n- Wood: 9\n- Sheep: 18\n- Brick: 16\n- Ore: 11\n\nThe total initial value = (8*5) + (11*10) + (22*14) + (18*20) + (8*33) = 40 + 110 + 308 + 360 + 264 = 1082.\n\nAfter the trades:\n- Total value = (8*5) + (9*10) + (18*14) + (16*20) + (11*33) = 40 + 90 + 252 + 320 + 363 = 1065.\n\nIt seems there was a slight decrease in total value after the trades. Let's assess the new offer from Player 1:\n- Offered: 5 Brick -> Requested: 4 Ore\n\nIf Player 0 accepts:\n- Brick: 16 + 5 = 21\n- Ore: 11 - 4 = 7\n\nNew total value = (8*5) + (9*10) + (18*14) + (21*20) + (7*33) = 40 + 90 + 252 + 420 + 231 = 1033.\n\nAccepting this offer would further decrease the total value of resources for Player 0.\n\nConsidering the options and the goal to increase the total value of resources, let's re-evaluate the current situation and think about a potential new offer.\n\nCurrent resources and values:\n- Wheat: 8 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 9 (Value: 10)\n- Sheep: 18 (Value: 14)\n- Brick: 16 (Value: 20)\n- Ore: 11 (Value: 33)\n\nTo maximize value, we should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but in a more favorable quantity.\n\nLet's examine a potential trade offer. Ore has the highest value. We could try to get more Ore or maintain what we have while acquiring other valuable resources.\n\nSince the last offer from Player 1 was not beneficial, we need to think of a new offer. \n\nConsidering the values:\n- Offering some Wheat (lower value) or Wood (moderate value) for Ore (higher value) could be beneficial.\n\nLet's make an offer:\n- Offered: 4 Wheat -> Requested: 1 Ore\n\nThe action in the required format is: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`.\n\nThe final answer is: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`.",
