I need to trade resources I have in excess for those with higher value per unit or that I lack. Brick is abundant (21), but its value per unit (27) is lower than Ore (37). Wheat and Wood are now lower, but their values are also lower.\n\n4. **Next Move**:\n   - Offer excess Brick (6) for Ore (4) to increase value: 6 * 27 = 162 vs 4 * 37 = 148. This is a loss (162 - 148 = -14), so not ideal.\n   - Alternatively, trade Brick for higher-value Sheep (18) or Ore (37). Sheep is 18 vs Brick 27, so trade Brick for Sheep is a loss (27 - 18 = -9 per unit).\n   - Best is to trade Brick for Ore, even if slightly unfavorable, to consolidate higher-value Ore. However, previous offer was rejected.\n   - Re-evaluate: Maybe offer fewer Brick for Ore to make it attractive. For example, 4 Brick (108) for 3 Ore (111) is a slight gain (111 - 108 = +3).\n\n5. **New Offer**:\n   - Offer 4 Brick for 3 Ore. This gives me +3 in value and reduces Brick excess while increasing Ore.\n\nFinal answer: [Offer: 4 Brick -> 3 Ore]",
