I will accept it and then consider an offensive move.\n\n4. What should I propose next?  After the deal I will be low on Brick (14) and low on Sheep (18) but will have plenty Ore (8).  Wood and Wheat stay modest.  Player 0 by now is rather Ore-poor (subjective).  Looking for a deal that uses 4 to 5 Ore at high margin (since 38 is high value) to get something worth more than 4\u00d738=152.\n\nBest target appears to be Brick (value 27).  \nIf I ask for 6 Brick (worth 162), the contestable margin exceeds 152.  \nOffer I\u2019m willing to ship out: 4 Ore \u2192 6 Brick  \nThat gives me +6 Brick \u20134 Ore = +162 \u2013 152 = +10 net value.  Relatively small.\n\nSecond idea: bundle 4 Ore + 1 Wheat to get 6 Brick + 1 Wood (small kickers).  I\u2019d gain +10 Brick \u2011 >270 vs 4\u00d738+5 = 157 \u2026 delta +113.  But I expect to be rejected because Player 0 may view 1 Wheat as near-worthless.\n\nThird plan: 4 Ore \u2192 5 Brick (more plausible to opponent).  Net value gain 135 (Brick) \u2013 152 (Ore) = \u201317, which is worse for me.  Unacceptable.\n\nHence the 4 Ore \u2192 6 Brick is the only positive-margin trade that is reasonable.\n\nAction plan:\n- Accept the current offer, then immediately offer 4 Ore for 6 Brick.\n\n[Accept]",
