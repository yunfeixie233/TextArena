However, since Ore is my highest-valued resource (33 each) and I already have a good amount, I'll prioritize acquiring more Brick (25 each), which I value highly but have limited quantities of.\n\nFor this first turn, I propose a trade that gives me a net gain if accepted:  \n- **Offer:** I give 2 Sheep (each valued at 12) and 2 Wood (each valued at 8) \u2192 for 2 Brick (each valued at 25).  \n  - My calculation:  \n    - Cost to me: 2 Sheep (24) + 2 Wood (16) = 40 total value given.  \n    - Gain for me: 2 Brick = 50 total value received.  \n    - **Net gain:** +10 in value (50 - 40).  \n\nI\u2019m proposing this because it targets Brick with a favorable value margin, and I have ample Sheep (16) and Wood (19) to spare.
