I notice I have no Wheat left, and Wheat was used effectively in past trades to acquire high-value Ore. Regaining Wheat would let me make similar trades in future turns since Player 0 has previously accepted Wheat-involving deals.  \n\nOptimal offer: **Trade 5 Wood for 8 Wheat**.  \n- Value given: 5 Wood \u00d7 9 = 45.  \n- Value received: 8 Wheat \u00d7 6 = 48.  \n- Net gain: 48 - 45 = **+3 value**.  \n\nThis is low-risk: it uses my minimal Wood (leaving me with 0), but gains Wheat for future negotiations. Player 0 accepted a similar resource trade earlier (8 Wheat + 10 Wood for 10 Brick), suggesting they value bundles with Wood.  \n\n**To Player 0:**  \n\"I see you have Wheat available. I\u2019d like to trade 5 of my Wood for 8 of your Wheat. This gives you more crafting freedom and balances our resources fairly!\"  \n\n**Next action:**  \n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 8 Wheat]",
