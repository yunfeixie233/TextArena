      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to strategically evaluate the resources I have and potentially trade some of them for others that could increase my total value. Let's start by calculating the total value of my current resources.\n\n1. Wheat: 16 * 5 = 80\n2. Wood: 8 * 8 = 64\n3. Sheep: 22 * 12 = 264\n4. Brick: 25 * 25 = 625\n5. Ore: 14 * 37 = 518\n\nTotal value = 80 + 64 + 264 + 625 + 518 = 1551\n\nTo make a profitable trade, I need to identify which resources I can offer that are likely to be of less value to me than the resources I receive. Let's examine my resources and their values:\n\n- Wheat is the least valuable per unit.\n- Ore is very valuable per unit but I have a considerable quantity of it.\n\nLet's consider making an initial offer that could potentially increase my total value. Since Brick and Ore are high-value resources and I already have a significant quantity of them, I might look to trade some of my lower-value resources or those that are less abundant relative to their value.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some Wheat and possibly Wood (as they are among the lower-value resources per unit) in exchange for more Ore or Brick, if possible, or another valuable resource. However, since I already have a lot of Brick and Ore, I should first check if my opponent is willing to trade something else.\n\nFor my first turn, I'll make an offer to see how my opponent responds. I'll offer some Wheat (the lowest value resource per unit) and some Sheep (since I have a lot of them) in exchange for Wood (since it's relatively low in quantity for me but not the lowest value per unit).\n\nLet's make the offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 4 Sheep -> 3 Wood, 2 Brick]`\n\nThis means I'm offering 5 Wheat (value = 25) and 4 Sheep (value = 48), totaling 73, in exchange for 3 Wood (value = 24) and 2 Brick (value = 50), totaling 74. The offer slightly increases my total value if accepted.\n\nSo, my action for Turn 1 is: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 4 Sheep -> 3 Wood, 2 Brick]`. \n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.",

Analyzing the offers and rejections:\n\n- Player 0 initially offered 5 Wheat (Value: 25) and 4 Sheep (Value: 48) for 3 Wood (Value: 24) and 2 Brick (Value: 50), totaling an offered value of 73 for requested resources worth 74. The offer was slightly unfavorable but close.\n- Player 1 counteroffered with the same resources (5 Wheat, 4 Sheep) for 2 Ore (Value: 74) and 1 Brick (Value: 25), totaling 99. This was a more favorable offer for Player 1 but was rejected by Player 0.\n- Player 0 then offered 2 Ore (Value: 74) and 2 Brick (Value: 50) for 4 Wood (Value: 32) and 3 Sheep (Value: 36), totaling 124 for resources worth 68. This was not favorable for Player 1.\n\n### New Offer\n\nTo make a more balanced and attractive offer, let's assess the values again and consider a new proposal. We should aim for a more equitable exchange or one that is favorable to both parties.\n\nGiven the rejections and the last offer made by Player 0 being significantly unfavorable to Player 1, we need to adjust our strategy. Let's directly propose an offer that is potentially more beneficial or at least more balanced.\n\nLet's offer: **[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood]**  \n- Offered: 3 Wheat (Value: 15) and 1 Sheep (Value: 12) = Total Value: 27\n- Requested: 2 Wood (Value: 16)\n\nThis offer is more balanced and slightly favorable to Player 0 in terms of value. However, the negotiation is about quantity and strategic value.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood]`\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds to this more modest and potentially more appealing offer.",
