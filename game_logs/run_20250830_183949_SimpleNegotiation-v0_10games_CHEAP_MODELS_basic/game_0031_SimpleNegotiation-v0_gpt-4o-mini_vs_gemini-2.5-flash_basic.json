I would like more Brick and Ore. However, the proposed trade ratio is not favorable.\n\nI will make a counter-offer. I want to get rid of some Wheat and Wood, and get some high-value items like Brick and Ore.\nMy current strategy is to trade away low-value items (Wheat, Wood) for high-value items (Brick, Ore, Sheep).\nI have 23 Wheat and 15 Wood. I have 21 Brick and 19 Ore.\nI will offer a larger quantity of my low-value resources for a smaller quantity of their high-value resources.\n\nHow about I offer 8 Wheat and 5 Wood for 2 Brick and 1 Ore?\nOffered: 8 Wheat (8*5 = 40) + 5 Wood (5*12 = 60) = 100\nRequested: 2 Brick (2*27 = 54) + 1 Ore (1*34 = 34) = 88\nThis is still not ideal, as I'm giving more value than I receive.\n\nLet's adjust it to make it more beneficial for me:\nI'll offer 6 Wheat and 3 Wood for 1 Brick and 1 Ore.\nOffered: 6 Wheat (6*5 = 30) + 3 Wood (3*12 = 36) = 66\nRequested: 1 Brick (1*27 = 27) + 1 Ore (1*34 = 34) = 61\nThis is closer.\n\nWhat if I offer a lot of Wheat for some Brick?\nI have 23 Wheat. They want Brick.\nLet's try to get 4 Brick from them.\n4 Brick = 4 * 27 = 108.\nHow much Wheat is 108 value? 108 / 5 = 21.6. So, about 22 Wheat. That's almost all my Wheat.\n\nI will make an offer that is slightly better for them but still good for me.\nI have a lot of low-value resources and need more high-value resources.\n\nMy target is to increase my total value.\nI want to trade my Wheat and Wood for Brick and Ore.\n\nLet's reconsider the current offer: Offered items: 2 Wood, 3 Wheat -> Requested items: 4 Brick, 2 Ore\nTheir requested items are worth 176. Their offered items are worth 39.\nThis is a bad deal to accept. So, I will deny this specific offer.\n\nNow, for my new offer. I want to get more Brick and Ore.\nI have 23 Wheat, 15 Wood.\nI will offer Wheat and Wood for Brick and Ore.\n\nI will try to make an offer that is appealing to them but nets me a gain.\nI need to be careful not to make a bad trade.\n\nMy current focus is to get rid of low-value resources.\n\nLet's try this:\nI offer 10 Wheat and 5 Wood. Value = (10 * 5) + (5 * 12) = 50 + 60 = 110.\nI request 3 Brick and 2 Ore. Value = (3 * 27) + (2 * 34) = 81 + 68 = 149.\nThis is a good deal for me.

Given Player 1's previous offers, they might still be interested in Wheat and Wood, or alternatively, I might explore offering some Brick for additional Ore or a balance of other resources.\n\n**Next Trade Proposal:**\nI will make an offer to Player 1 as follows:\n\n```plaintext\n[Offer: 4 Brick, 2 Wheat -> 3 Ore, 1 Wood]\n```\n\n### Awaiting Response:\nOnce the trade offer is made, I will be ready to respond to Player 1's counter-offers or acceptances accordingly.",
