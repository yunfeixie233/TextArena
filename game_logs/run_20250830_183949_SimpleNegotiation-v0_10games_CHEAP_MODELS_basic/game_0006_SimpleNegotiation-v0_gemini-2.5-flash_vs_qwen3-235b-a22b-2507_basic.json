I will make a counter offer.\nI want to increase the value of my resources.\nI currently have 25 Ore, which is a significant amount and can be used to acquire other valuable resources.\nI have plenty of [Wheat] (16 qty), [Brick] (13 qty), and [Ore] (25 qty).\nI have less [Wood] (9 qty) and [Sheep] (5 qty).\nI want to get more [Wood] and [Sheep], or more of the higher value resources like [Brick] or [Ore] for a good price.\n\nPlayer 1 offered to give me Brick and Wheat, but asked for Ore which is more valuable.\nI will counter-offer to get some of Player 1's Ore, and offer resources I have in abundance.\nI want to trade away some Wheat.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore from Player 1.\nIf Player 1 wants 4 Ore, maybe they would be willing to give me 3 Ore for something.\nI can offer some Wheat and Brick.\nMy current values: Wheat=5, Wood=12, Sheep=12, Brick=21, Ore=37.\n\nOffer 5 Wheat (5*5=25) and 2 Brick (2*21=42) for 3 Ore (3*37=111).\nMy offer value: 25+42=67. Requested value: 111. This is not good for me.\n\nLet's try to get some Sheep or Wood.\nMy current Sheep is low (5).\n\nIf I offer 4 Brick (4*21=84) and 5 Wheat (5*5=25), total value = 109.\nAnd I ask for 3 Ore (3*37=111). This is almost balanced, but still a loss for me.\n\nLet's make an offer to get some Ore but at a better rate than Player 1's current offer.\nPlayer 1 wants 4 Ore for 5 Brick and 3 Wheat.\nI will propose to give less Ore. I will offer 2 Ore for 5 Brick and 3 Sheep.\nMy offer: 2 Ore (2*37 = 74)\nPlayer 1 gives: 5 Brick (5*21 = 105) and 3 Sheep (3*12 = 36).\nPlayer 1's value = 105+36 = 141.\nThis is a gain for me of 141 - 74 = 67. This is a very good deal for me.\n\nLet's think about a more balanced offer to increase my total value.\nI want to gain value.\nI can offer resources I have a lot of (Ore, Brick, Wheat) to get resources I have less of (Wood, Sheep) or to get more value with a good trade.\n\nPlayer 1 offered 5 Brick (105) and 3 Wheat (15) for 4 Ore (148). Total loss for me = 28.\nI will propose an offer that is beneficial to me.\nLet's try to get more Ore for cheaper.\nI will offer 5 Brick and 5 Wheat for 3 Ore.\nValue of 5 Brick (5*21=105) and 5 Wheat (5*5=25) = 130.\nValue of 3 Ore (3*37=111).\nThis means I give 130 value for 111 value, so I lose 19.\n\nI need to make an offer where I gain value.\n\nHow about I offer 2 Ore and 5 Wheat for 4 Brick and 3 Sheep?\nMy offer: 2 Ore (74) + 5 Wheat (25) = 99\nTheir offer: 4 Brick (84) + 3 Sheep (36) = 120\nThis is a gain of 21 for me.
