My optimal outcome is to trade resources I value less for resources I value more. Ore is the most valuable resource I have, and I also have a fair amount of Brick. I might try to get rid of my Wheat or Wood for some more valuable resource.\n\nHere's my plan:\nI will deny the offer.\nI will counter with an offer that benefits me, perhaps trading some less valuable resources for more valuable ones, potentially Ore or Brick.\n\nI have 11 Wheat (Value 6), 6 Wood (Value 8), 15 Sheep (Value 12), 20 Brick (Value 27), and 14 Ore (Value 33).\nThe last trade was 2 Brick for 2 Ore from my side, which was advantageous to me.\n\nI will try to trade 3 Sheep or 2 Wood for 1 Ore.\n\nCurrent resources after trades for Player 1:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 10   Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 5    Value: 8\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 15   Value: 12\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 18   Value: 27\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 17   Value: 33\n\nAfter the previous trades, my Ore quantity has increased.\nThe last offer from P0 was 2 Ore for 2 Brick. This is a negative value for me.\n\nLet's try to offload some of my less valued resources.\nI have 15 Sheep (value 12) and 18 Brick (value 27).\nI have 10 Wheat (value 6) and 5 Wood (value 8).\nI will try to trade Wheat/Wood for Ore/Brick.\n\nLet's make an offer where I gain value.\nI will give up 3 Wheat (3*6=18) for 1 Brick (27). This is a positive trade for me.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

A 10-point jump is nevertheless attractive, so **if I expect this to be the last favourable offer I\u2019ll accept**, but odds are Player 1 proposing the reverse of my own rejected offer means they\u2019re just seeing what I\u2019ll swallow.\n\nRather than immediately accept, I will attempt to shave the offer to something still favourable yet less one-sided for them, keeping more Wheat in case of future desperations (both theirs and mine).\n\nCounter-offer: \n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]\n\nIf Player 1 accepts, my new state becomes:\n\n- Wheat 16 (-2)  \n- Wood  13 (-1)  \n- Sheep 14 (+1)  \n- Brick 27 (+1)  \n- Ore   12  \n\nValue-change: [(-2\u00b76) + (-1\u00b79) + 1\u00b718 + 1\u00b728] = (-12 \u2013 9 + 18 + 28) = +25 points, larger gain for me and still attractive to them (they keep one wheat and get extra supply flexibility).",
