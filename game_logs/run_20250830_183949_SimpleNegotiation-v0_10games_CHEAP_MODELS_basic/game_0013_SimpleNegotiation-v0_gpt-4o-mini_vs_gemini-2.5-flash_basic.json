This indicates that if you accept, you would be trading resources that are of greater value than the ones you receive.\n\nHowever, retaining a balanced resource strategy is key. If you accept the trade, the following would happen:\n- You would lose 3 Ore (Value of 102) and 1 Sheep (Value of 14), totaling a loss of 116.\n- You would gain 5 Brick (Value of 100) and 2 Wheat (Value of 10), totaling a gain of 110.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAccepting this trade means you will incur a net loss of value (116 - 110 = -6), while you are also losing some valuable ore. Considering these factors, it may be beneficial to **[Deny]** the trade offer.\n\n#### Action:\n[Deny]",
