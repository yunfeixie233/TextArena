      "response": "After reviewing my resources and their values, I've decided to make the following trade offer. I believe this proposal benefits both parties by exchanging resources where we might have different valuations or surpluses, but it ensures a significant increase in my total value according to my own valuation.\n\nI'm offering 2 Sheep in exchange for 1 Ore and 1 Brick. Here's the reasoning for my offer:\n- Sheep have a moderate value to me (18 per unit), but I currently have 17, so I can spare some to acquire higher-value resources.\n- Ore is the highest-value resource in my set (34 per unit), and gaining even one boosts my total significantly.\n- Brick has a high value (25 per unit) and complements the Ore, making the trade very efficient for me.\n- By my valuation, I give up 36 worth of value (2 \u00d7 18) but gain 59 (34 + 25), resulting in a net gain of 23 in total value. This is too advantageous to pass up for my strategy.\n\nTrade offer:  \n**[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]**  \n\nI look forward to your response. This trade could benefit both of us if you have surplus Ore or Brick and need Sheep for your own goals. Let me know if you'd like to discuss adjustments!",
