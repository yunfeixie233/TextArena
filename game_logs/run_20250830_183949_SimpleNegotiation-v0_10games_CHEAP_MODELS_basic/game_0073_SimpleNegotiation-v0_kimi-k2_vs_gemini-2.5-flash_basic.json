This was a bad trade. I need to be more careful.\nIt looks like I'm trying to get Brick, which is a good resource, but I'm overpaying. I should aim for more balanced trades.\nI should try to offload some of my high quantity/low value items for higher value items, or simply make sure the value of what I get is more than what I give.\n\nWhat I want: More Brick (Value 27) and Ore (Value 37).\nWhat I have a lot of: Sheep (Qty 19, Value 17).\nWhat I have some of: Wheat (Qty 6, Value 5), Wood (Qty 5, Value 8), Brick (Qty 12, Value 27), Ore (Qty 24, Value 37).\n\nLet's try to trade Sheep for Brick again, but with better value.\n\nI want to get 1 Brick (Value 27).\nHow much Sheep should I offer for it?\n1 Sheep is 17.\n2 Sheep would be 34. This is a bit much, but it's closer to the value of a Brick than 1 Sheep.\nIf I offer 2 Sheep for 1 Brick:\nValue given: 2 * 17 = 34\nValue received: 1 * 27 = 27\nStill a loss.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep and some Wheat?\n1 Sheep (17) + 2 Wheat (10) = 27. Perfectly balanced. That's a good trade if Player 0 accepts it.\n\nAnother idea is to trade some of my excess Ore for something valuable I can then flip for Brick. Or just simple trades for things I need.\n\nLet's re-evaluate what I have:\nWheat: 6 (Value 5)\nWood: 5 (Value 8)\nSheep: 19 (Value 17)\nBrick: 12 (Value 27)\nOre: 24 (Value 37)\n\nI have plenty of Sheep and Ore. I want more Brick.\n\nLet's try:\nOffer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick. Value: 34 -> 27. Loss.\nOffer: 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick. Value: 27 -> 27. Even. This is a good offer!\n\nLet me consider what Player 0 might need. If Player 0 is also trying to get Brick, then this offer might not be good for them.\nHowever, I can only assume Player 0 is also trying to increase their total value.\n\nI will try for the balanced trade this time.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
