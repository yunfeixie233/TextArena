However, after reviewing your proposal of 10 Wheat and 5 Wood for 8 Brick, I have to say that in terms of resource values for me, this would result in a net loss of total value. Brick is one of my higher-value resources, and I'd be giving up too much in this trade.\n\nThat said, I'm definitely open to countering with a more balanced proposal that benefits both of us. Specifically, I'd be willing to trade a smaller quantity of Brick for the resources you offered, but at a slightly adjusted rate to ensure I gain value. Here's a concrete offer from my side: **I'll give you 2 Brick in exchange for your 7 Wheat and 3 Wood**. This way, you still get some Brick (just less than you asked for), and I manage a small value gain to keep things fair. \n\nIf this isn't quite what you were thinking, I'm happy to discuss alternatives\u2014maybe shifting to a different set of resources? For example, I'd be especially interested in trading for Ore if you have it available. Let me know what you think!\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 7 Wheat, 3 Wood]",
