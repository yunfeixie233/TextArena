      "response": "My current total value is: 17 * 6 + 10 * 10 + 22 * 14 + 16 * 26 + 14 * 38 = 102 + 100 + 308 + 416 + 532 = 1458.\nI want to increase my total value.\n\nI am Player 0. It is turn 1 out of 10.\nI will make an offer to Player 1.\nMy strategy is to offer resources with lower value to acquire resources with higher value.\nI have a lot of Sheep and Wheat, which have lower values. I also have plenty of Brick and Ore, but they are very valuable.\nI will try to trade away some Sheep and Wheat to get Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's try to trade Sheep for Brick.\n1 Sheep is worth 14. 1 Brick is worth 26.\nTo make it appealing, I need to offer more than 1 Sheep per Brick.\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (28 value) for 1 Brick (26 value), it's close to fair, might be accepted. My value would go down by 2. This is not good.\nI want to make an offer that increases my value.\nI need to offer less value than I receive.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat for Ore.\n1 Wheat is worth 6. 1 Ore is worth 38.\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (18 value) for 1 Ore (38 value), I gain 20 value. This is a very good deal for me. Player 1 might deny it.\nIf I offer 5 Wheat (30 value) for 1 Ore (38 value), I gain 8 value. This is still good for me.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat for Brick.\n1 Wheat is worth 6. 1 Brick is worth 26.\nIf I offer 4 Wheat (24 value) for 1 Brick (26 value), I gain 2 value. This is a small gain, but still a gain. Player 1 might accept since their gain is also 2.\n\nI will try a generous-looking offer to get a high-value resource.\nI have a lot of Sheep.\nLet me propose trading Sheep for Ore.\nValue of 1 Sheep = 14. Value of 1 Ore = 38.\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (value 28) for 1 Ore (value 38), I gain 10 value. This is a good deal for me. Player 1 would lose 10 value.\nThis is likely to be denied.\n\nI need to make an offer that is appealing to the other player but also benefits me.\nLet's consider trading resources that I have in abundance for resources I want more of.\nI have 22 Sheep and 17 Wheat.\nI want more Brick and Ore.\n\nLet's try to trade 3 Sheep (42 value) for 1 Ore (38 value) and 1 Wheat (6 value). Net gain for me: (38+6) = 44. Net loss for me: 42. Gain of 2.\nThis is too complex.\n\nLet's make a simple offer.\nI want to get Ore or Brick. I will offer Sheep or Wheat.\n\nOffer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick.\nMy value change: 1 Brick (26) - 3 Sheep (42) = -16. This is bad for me. I should offer less for more.\n\nOffer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick.\nMy value change: 1 Brick (26) - 2 Wheat (12) - 1 Sheep (14) = 26 - 26 = 0. This is a fair trade. I gain no value.\n\nMy goal is to increase my value.\n\nLet's try to trade 1 Wood (10) for 1 Wheat (6) and 1 Sheep (14).\nI give Wood (10). I get Wheat (6) and Sheep (14). Net change is (6+14)-10 = 10. I gain 10.\nThis is a good deal for me but player 1 loses 10 value. Probably not accepted.\n\nI will go for a small gain on my side but something that looks like it could benefit P1 as well.\nMaybe I can use my high quantity of Sheep.\nI have 22 Sheep (value 14).\nI want more Brick (value 26) or Ore (value 38).\n\nOffer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Wood, 1 Wheat.\nMy gain: (10 + 6) - (3 * 14) = 16 - 42 = -26. Bad.\n\nWhat if I offer a higher value resource in exchange for a higher quantity of lower value resources? That would be good if I want to diversify, but currently I want to consolidate towards high value.\n\nLet me offer 2 Sheep for 1 Brick. My value changes by 26 - 2*14 = 26 - 28 = -2. Not good.\n\nI will offer Wheat for something. I have 17 Wheat.\nOffer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep.\nMy value change: 1 Sheep (14) - 3 Wheat (18) = -4. Not good.\n\nI need to get *more* value for what I give.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nOffer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore.\nMy value change: 1 Ore (38) - 5 Wheat (30) = 8. This is good for me.\nIs it appealing to Player 1? Player 1 would lose 8 value. Probably not.\n\nLet's try to get Brick.\nOffer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick.\nMy value change: 1 Brick (26) - 3 Wheat (18) = 8. This is good for me. Player 1 loses 8 value. Unlikely.\n\nWhat about a trade where I offer a quantity of low value resources for a smaller quantity of high value resources?\nExample: 4 Wheat + 1 Sheep (4*6+14 = 24+14=38) for 1 Ore (38). This is fair. No value change.\n\nI need to gain value.\nI will try to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me but might be acceptable because of the quantities.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep. Let me offer 3 Sheep and 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick and 1 Wood.\nMy value change: (1 Brick=26 + 1 Wood=10) - (3 Sheep=42 + 1 Wheat=6) = 36 - 48 = -12. Bad.\n\nLet's simplify.\nI have high quantities of Sheep (22) and Wheat (17).\nValue: Wheat (6), Wood (10), Sheep (14), Brick (26), Ore (38).\n\nI will offer 2 Sheep for 1 Wood and 1 Wheat.\nMy value change: (10 + 6) - (2 * 14) = 16 - 28 = -12. Bad for me.\n\nI need to offer less value than I receive.\n\nWhat if I try to trade away a high value resource for an even higher value resource? That's not how it works.\n\nI will try to trade away Wheat for Brick.\nPlayer 1 might have excess Brick, or need Wheat.\nI need to come up with an offer that benefits me (my total value increases), and *might* be appealing to Player 1.\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (18 value) for 1 Brick (26 value), I gain 8. P1 loses 8.\n\nI'll propose an offer that is fair, but my value increases because I offload something I have a lot of. This is hard since resource values are fixed.\n\nI will propose to trade 4 Wheat for 1 Brick.\nValue of 4 Wheat = 4 * 6 = 24.\nValue of 1 Brick = 26.\nIf this trade goes through, I give away 24 value and receive 26 value. My total value increases by 2.\nThis is a small gain, but it is a gain.\nPlayer 1 receives 24 value and gives away 26 value, so Player 1 loses 2 value.\nThis is not appealing for P1.\n\nI need to offer something P1 wants.\nWhat if P1 needs Wheat or Sheep?\n\nI will make an offer that is slightly unbalanced in my favor.\nI will offer 3 Sheep and 1 Wheat for 1 Ore.\nValue of 3 Sheep = 3 * 14 = 42.\nValue of 1 Wheat = 6.\nTotal offered value = 42 + 6 = 48.\nValue of 1 Ore = 38.\nIf this trade occurs, I offer 48 and receive 38. My value decreases by 10. This is not good.\n\nI need to target a net increase in my worth.\n\nLet's target trading Wheat for Ore.\nWheat value = 6. Ore value = 38.\nIf I offer 5 Wheat for 1 Ore:\nMy value change: 38 - (5*6) = 38 - 30 = +8. (Good for me)\nPlayer 1's value change: 30 - 38 = -8. (Bad for Player 1)\nPlayer 1 will likely deny this.\n\nI will try to trade a slightly more valuable resource for an equivalent amount of more widely useful resources.\nLet's try to trade 1 Brick (26) for 2 Sheep (28).\nMy value: 28 - 26 = 2 gain.\nPlayer 1: 26 - 28 = 2 loss.\n\nThis is difficult because I need P1 to accept, meaning they gain, or at least don't lose much. But I must gain too.\n\nLet's try:\n[Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]\nMy value: 1 Sheep (14) - (1 Wood (10) + 1 Wheat (6)) = 14 - 16 = -2. Not good.\n\nI'm focused on raw value. I also have to consider Player 1's perspective. They might need a specific resource.\n\nPerhaps I can offer a large quantity of a low-value resource for a smaller quantity of a higher-value resource, where the total values are close.\nExample: 3 Sheep (42) for 1 Brick (26) and 1 Wood (10). Total 36.\nMy value: 36 - 42 = -6. Not good.\n\nI will offer a trade that gives me a small positive gain while providing a reasonable amount of resources to Player 1.\nI will offer 4 Wheat for 1 Brick. My value gain is 2. (26-24=2)\nThis is not going to fly for Player 1.\n\nI need to consider that Player 1 might accept a trade that slightly benefits me if it helps them fulfill a goal (e.g., getting a diverse set of resources, or reaching a specific production target, which I don't know). But for now, I should assume they are optimizing for value just like me.\n\nIf I make a trade that is perfectly fair, my value remains the same.\nI must make a trade that gives me more value than I give. This implies that Player 1 loses value, or gains less than me.\n\nI will try to trade Wheat for Ore, as it's the highest value resource.\nI will try to trade 6 Wheat for 1 Ore.\nMy value change: 1 Ore (38) - 6 Wheat (36) = +2.\nThis is a gain for me. Player 1 loses 2 value. This is a very small loss for P1, and 6 Wheat is a lot of resource. Perhaps P1 needs a lot of Wheat?\n\nOkay, I will make this offer.\nMy current total value: 1458.\nIf accepted:\nResources: Wheat: 17-6=11. Ore: 14+1=15. Other quantities unchanged.\nNew total value: 11*6 + 10*10 + 22*14 + 16*26 + 15*38 = 66 + 100 + 308 + 416 + 570 = 1460.\nGain of 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Action\": \"Offer\",\n  \"Offer\": {\n    \"Wheat\": 6\n  },\n  \"Request\": {\n    \"Ore\": 1\n  }\n}\n```",
