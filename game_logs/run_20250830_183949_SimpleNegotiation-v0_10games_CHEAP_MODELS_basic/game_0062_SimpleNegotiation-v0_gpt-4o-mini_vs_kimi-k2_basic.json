I\u2019d like to convert more of my lower-value (to me) resources **Brick**, plus extra Wheat/Wood, into Ore (which is highest) or maybe Sheep (next best).\n\nAn acceptable offer must\n\u2003- give up \u2264 150 value in Brick+others  \n\u2003- receive \u2265 150 value in Ore/Sheep  \nso the trade leaves me strictly better off.\n\nBecause I expect P0 to accept a deal if it gives them \u2265 value, I need to stay **just above mutual benefit (\u2265 1 value net positive for me)**.\n\nLooks attractive: exchange **6 Brick (worth 180) for 3 Ore (111 value to me)** is still a loss (\u201369), so not yet.  \nI need a ratio closer to 4 Brick : 3 Ore (120 vs 111 = still loss).\n\nHence I must include **cheaper resources**: instead of pure Brick, dilute with Wheat/Wood.\n\nSafe, strictly profitable combo:\n\u2003Give: 2 Wheat + 1 Wood + 2 Brick (total value 12+9+60 = 81)  \n\u2003Get : 2 Ore                         (value 74) \u2192 close but negative.\n\nAdd another Ore exchanged:\n\nTry giving **2 Wheat + 2 Wood + 2 Brick (value 12+18+60 = 90)** and receiving **2 Ore (value 74)** \u2013 still loss.\n\nSwap in Sheep: Sheep is 14 \u2192 nicer to use Brick + Sheep:\n\nGive : 2 Brick + 3 Sheep (60+42=102)  \nGet  : 2 Ore            (74) \u2013 still loss.\n\nIt seems direct upgrade Brick\u2192Ore can\u2019t be strictly favorable for me.  \nTherefore I simulate \u201cstrength in numbers\u201d: I overpay bricks \u201cslightly\u201d to obtain a **lump** of Ore + Sheep, leveraging P0\u2019s higher per-unit valuation of Brick.\n\nTarget: loss 1\u20132 value in Brick gain \u2265 3 value in Ore/Sheep.\n\nOffer that looks good on chart and strictly improves my stack:\n\nGive away 5 Brick (150 value to me)  \nReceive   3 Ore (111 value) + 1 Sheep (14) + 1 Wheat (6) = 131 total value \u2192 net loss of 19 \u2013 discard.\n\nNeed to cut brick quantity.  Try 4 Brick:\n\n4 Brick (120) \u2192 2 Ore (74) + 1 Sheep + 1 Wood (14+9)=97  \u2192 net 23 loss.\n\nI need higher-yield ratio.  I notice Brick/Ore 1.25-to-1 virtually impossible for mutual gain.\n\nHence safest minimalistic move: ease Brick pressure sell 3 Brick (90) for 2 Sheep (28).  Strictly worse.\n\nHence only mutually beneficial niceties are marginal.  Best incremental profitable yet \u201cpalatable\u201d lets me unload excess **Brick** for **Ore / Sheep**.\n\nCompute 3-valued surplus:\n\nGive: 3 Brick + 2 Wheat      (90+12=102)  \nGet : 2 Ore                  (74) \u2192 not enough.\n\nEvident requirement: I need to bundle bigger lumps; best hope is **5 Brick** to extract value, but pair with Sheep not Wood/Wheat.\n\nFormulate:\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick, 1 Wood -> 3 Ore, 2 Sheep]\n\nValue gained: 3 Ore = 111, 2 Sheep = 28 \u2192 139  \nValue lost : 5 Brick = 150, 1 Wood = 9 \u2192 159  \nNet : \u201320 \u2026 still deficit.\n\nThe **only strictly positive** package I can design uses small resource mix while noticing Sheep\u2019s decent value:\n\nMy strictly profitable mix yet **still likely acceptable by P0** must be modest:\n\nTry give **3 Brick, 2 Sheep** (60+28=88) for **2 Ore** (74) \u2192 net loss 14.\n\nI must realise **my Brick is over-supplied** hence willing to overpay somewhat in Brick count to drag precious Ore.  \nAfter small rounding we accept a microscopic positive benefit:\n\nOffer:\n\u20033 Brick (90) + 1 Sheep (14) \u2192 2 Ore (74)\n\nValue for me: \u2013 (90+14)=\u2013104 ; gain 74 = \u201330 (bad).  \nThus no strictly better trade possible that yields positive *without* adding too little.\n\nRe-calculate bid that **does** give me positive gain: \n\nGive: 4 Brick (120)  \nGet : 3 Ore   (111) \u2013 already done; worse by \u20139.\n\nGive: 5 Brick (150)  \nGet : 4 Ore   (148) Just \u20132.  Closest net-beneficial.\n\nSince I cannot push to 4 ore, set 5 brick for 3.  \nAfter scan, I accept slight negative pixels impose hint of cost:\n\nLet\u2019s craft **net-positive for me** on edge:\n\nOffer:\n [Offer: 5 Brick -> 4 Ore]\n\nValue gained: 4 ore @ 37 \u2192 148  \nValue lost : 5 brick @ 30 \u2192 150  \nNet: \u20132 (not strictly plus).\n\nI must withdraw.\n\nHence best **strictly beneficial** line-up is **smaller lump**:\n\nOffer:\n [Offer: 2 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\n\nMy value gain: 2 Ore (74)  \nLoss: 2 Brick (60) + 1 Sheep (14) = 74  \nTotal net difference = +0.

So tiny sweetener: add negligible Wheat:\n\nTest: 2 Brick, 1 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore, 1 Wheat  \n\nMy value:\nGain  2 Ore + 1 Wheat = 74+6 = 80  \nLoss  2 Brick + 1 Sheep = 60+14 = 74  \nNet  +6.  Good.\n\nMay P0 accept?  Assume P0 values Brick higher (offer prev at 5 Brick for mere 3 Ore was willing); this reverse ratio is attractive to me!\n\nSo my outgoing offer this turn is:\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 1 Wheat]\n\nThis trade gives me a strict gain of +6 total value while keeping conversation friendly.",
