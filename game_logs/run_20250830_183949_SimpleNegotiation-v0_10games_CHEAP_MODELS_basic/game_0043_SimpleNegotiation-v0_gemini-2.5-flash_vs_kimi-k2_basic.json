      "response": "My starting resources are:\n* Wheat: 17 (Value: 5)\n* Wood: 12 (Value: 11)\n* Sheep: 17 (Value: 14)\n* Brick: 10 (Value: 26)\n* Ore: 9 (Value: 38)\n\nTotal value: (17*5) + (12*11) + (17*14) + (10*26) + (9*38) = 85 + 132 + 238 + 260 + 342 = 1057\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I want to trade lower-value items for higher-value items.\n\nLet's consider the relative values:\nWheat (5) < Wood (11) < Sheep (14) < Brick (26) < Ore (38)\n\nI have a lot of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep, which are the lower-value resources. I have less Brick and Ore, which are the higher-value resources.\n\nFor my first offer, I want to try to convert some of my lower-value resources into higher-value ones.\n\nA common strategy is to trade 2 or 3 of a low-value item for 1 of a high-value item.\n\nLet's aim for Ore or Brick.\n\nOption 1: Trade a lot of Sheep/Wood/Wheat for Ore/Brick.\nFor example, 3 Sheep (42) for 1 Ore (38). This would be a value loss unless I get more than 1 Ore or something else.\n2 Sheep (28) for 1 Brick (26). This is a decent trade if I make it.\n\nOption 2: Trade a mix of resources.\n\nI think a good starting point is to try to get more Ore, as it's the highest value.\nI have plenty of Sheep. 2 Sheep for 1 Ore is 28 value for 38 value, which is good. But it might be too aggressive for a first offer.\nLet's try to get Brick first.\n\nWhat about 3 Sheep (42) for 2 Brick (52)? That's a good trade.\nOr 2 Wood (22) and 1 Sheep (14) = 36 for 1 Ore (38). That's a small gain.\nOr 3 Wood (33) for 1 Brick (26). This is a value loss for them, so they might not accept.\n\nI'll try to trade a lower value common resource for a higher value less common resource.\nI have a good amount of Sheep and Wheat.\n\nLet's try to turn Sheep into Brick.\nMy current target is to convert 2 Sheep (Value 28) into 1 Brick (Value 26). This is effectively a slight negative for me in direct value, but it consolidates resources and gives me a higher value resource, which might be useful for future trades.\nActually, I want to *gain* value. So 1 Brick for 2 Sheep is not good for me.\n\nI need to offer less value than I receive.\nLet's try to offer 2 Sheep (28) for 1 Ore (38). That's a net gain of 10. This is aggressive.\nLet's try to offer 3 Sheep (42) for 2 Brick (52). Net gain of 10. Good.\nLet's try to offer 2 Wood (22) for 1 Brick (26). Net gain of 4.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat. 17 Wheat.\n5 Wheat = 25. Can I trade 5 Wheat for 1 Brick (26)? That's too close to even.\nCan I trade 7 Wheat (35) for 1 Ore (38)? That's a net gain of 3.\n\nLet's make a reasonable offer that clearly benefits me, but doesn't seem outrageously greedy for the first turn.\n\nI'll try to offer a mix of lower-value resources for a higher-value one.\nI have a surplus of Wheat and Wood.\n\nOffer: 2 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick.\nValue offered: (2 * 11) + (3 * 5) = 22 + 15 = 37\nValue requested: 1 * 26 = 26.\nNo, that's a loss for me. I need to offer *less* value than I receive.\n\nLet's offer a quantity of low value resources for a quantity of high value resources.\nConsider the multiples:\nSheep (14): 2 Sheep = 28, 3 Sheep = 42\nOre (38): 1 Ore = 38\nBrick (26): 1 Brick = 26, 2 Brick = 52\n\nSo, 3 Sheep for 1 Ore is quite balanced (42 vs 38). I gain 38-42 = -4 value. Not good.\nHow about 2 Sheep (28) for 1 Ore (38)? I gain 10 value. This feels like a good trade for me.\n\nLet's try that.\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
