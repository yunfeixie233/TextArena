      "response": "Based on the negotiation game progress, it looks like there have been several trades already made. Let's analyze the current status considering your resources and the value of trades.\n\n**Current Resources and Values:**\n- Wheat: Qty: 5 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: Qty: 18 (Value: 11)\n- Sheep: Qty: 3 (Value: 16)\n- Brick: Qty: 17 (Value: 30)\n- Ore: Qty: 15 (Value: 40)\n\n**Analysis of the Last Offer from Player 1:**\n- Player 1's offer: 3 Brick for 3 Ore\n- This trade would decrease your Brick and Ore quantity but evaluating their values:\n  - Brick Value: 30\n  - Ore Value: 40\n- By accepting this offer you will lose resources valued at 90 (3 Brick) to gain resources valued at 120 (3 Ore).\n\nGiven this analysis, it is beneficial to accept Player 1's trade offer.\n\n**Actions:**\n- [Accept]",
