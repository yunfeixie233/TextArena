However, Brick (29 per unit) and Sheep (18 per unit) are also valuable. To increase my total value, I propose a trade where I offer one unit of Ore in exchange for one unit of Brick and one unit of Sheep. Here's why:\n\n- **My valuation**: Giving 1 Ore (39) for 1 Brick (29) + 1 Sheep (18) means I gain +8 in total value (47 received vs. 39 given).  \n- **Strategic rationale**: This trade leverages my abundance of Ore while boosting my holdings in slightly lower-value resources\u2014diversifying without significant loss. The quantity exchange (1 for 2) may appear appealing to an opponent who values Ore highly.  \n\n**Proposed offer**:  \n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]  \n\nI\u2019m open to discussing adjustments if this doesn\u2019t align with your interests\u2014let me know what you\u2019re looking for!",
