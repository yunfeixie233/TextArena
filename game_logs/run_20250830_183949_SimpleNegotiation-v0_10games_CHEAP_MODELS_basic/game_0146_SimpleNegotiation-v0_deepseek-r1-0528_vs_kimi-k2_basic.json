      "response": "After carefully considering my current resources and the trade history, I see that offering Wheat for Brick has been mutually beneficial in the past. Player 1 accepted 4 Wheat for 1 Brick last turn, which increased my total value. I aim to replicate this success to continue reducing my surplus Wheat and acquiring high-value Brick. \n\nI'll offer the same terms again:  \n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]  \n\nThis trade would:  \n- Cost me 4 Wheat (loss of 20 value)  \n- Gain 1 Brick (gain of 22 value)  \n- Net increase of 2 value  \n\nMy remaining Wheat (15) is still plentiful, and Brick remains highly valuable (22 per unit). Player 1\u2019s willingness to accept this before suggests they undervalue Brick or need Wheat, so this offer is strategically sound.",
