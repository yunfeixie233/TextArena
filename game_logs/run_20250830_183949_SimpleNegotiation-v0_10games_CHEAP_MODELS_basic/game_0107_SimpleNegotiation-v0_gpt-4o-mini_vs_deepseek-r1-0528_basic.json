      "response": "To make well-informed decision-making, let's track the changes in Player 0's resources and calculate the total value after each trade.\n\n**Current Resources and Values:**\n- Wheat: 12 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 6 (Value: 9)\n- Sheep: 11 (Value: 18)\n- Brick: 9 (Value: 24)\n- Ore: 6 (Value: 36)\n\n**Initial Total Resource Value Calculation:**\n- Total Value = (12 * 5) + (6 * 9) + (11 * 18) + (9 * 24) + (6 * 36) \n- Total Value = 60 + 54 + 198 + 216 + 216 = 744\n\n**Turn Updates:**\n1. Accepted the trade from Player 1: 3 Sheep for 1 Ore and 1 Brick\n   - Resources after trade:\n     - Wheat: 12\n     - Wood: 6\n     - Sheep: 8 (11 - 3)\n     - Brick: 10 (9 + 1)\n     - Ore: 7 (6 + 1)\n   - Total Value = (12 * 5) + (6 * 9) + (8 * 18) + (10 * 24) + (7 * 36)\n   - Total Value = 60 + 54 + 144 + 240 + 252 = 750\n\n2. Accepted the trade from Player 1: 3 Sheep and 2 Wheat for 1 Ore and 1 Brick\n   - Resources after trade:\n     - Wheat: 10 (12 - 2)\n     - Wood: 6\n     - Sheep: 5 (8 - 3)\n     - Brick: 11 (10 + 1)\n     - Ore: 8 (7 + 1)\n   - Total Value = (10 * 5) + (6 * 9) + (5 * 18) + (11 * 24) + (8 * 36)\n   - Total Value = 50 + 54 + 90 + 264 + 288 = 746\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Wheat: 10\n- Wood: 6\n- Sheep: 5\n- Brick: 11\n- Ore: 8\n\nNow the current total value is **746**.\n\nConsidering the new offer from Player 1 (Offered items: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat for 1 Ore, 1 Brick):\n- This trade would reduce Player 0's Sheep to 2 and Wheat to 8 while increasing Ore to 9 and Brick to 12.\n\nCalculating the new total value if this trade is accepted:\n- Resources after the potential trade:\n  - Wheat: 8 (10 - 2)\n  - Wood: 6\n  - Sheep: 2 (5 - 3)\n  - Brick: 12 (11 + 1)\n  - Ore: 9 (8 + 1)\n- Total Value = (8 * 5) + (6 * 9) + (2 * 18) + (12 * 24) + (9 * 36)\n- Total Value = 40 + 54 + 36 + 288 + 324 = 742\n\nSince the value decreases to **742**, I will **reject** the offer.\n\n**Next move:**\nI will make a new offer that seeks to improve my resource value. Here is the new trade offer I will make to Player 1:\n\n**New Trade Offer:**\n```\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Brick -> 3 Ore]\n```\n\nThis way, I am looking to increase my Ore while giving away Wheat and some Brick, which still preserves value but also strategically aims to obtain essential resources.",
