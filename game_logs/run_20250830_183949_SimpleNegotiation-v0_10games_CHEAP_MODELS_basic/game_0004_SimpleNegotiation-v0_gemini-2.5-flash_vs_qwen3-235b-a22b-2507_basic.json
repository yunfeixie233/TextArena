      "response": "Okay, I understand. Player 1 rejected my previous offer and didn't make a counter-offer. I need to make a new offer that is more appealing to them, or try to understand what they might be looking for.\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Let's re-evaluate my resources and consider what I might offer or request.\n\nCurrent Resources:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 13 Value: 5 (Total Value: 65)\n*   [Wood] Qty: 12 Value: 9 (Total Value: 108)\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 14 Value: 18 (Total Value: 252)\n*   [Brick] Qty: 11 Value: 20 (Total Value: 220)\n*   [Ore] Qty: 5 Value: 35 (Total Value: 175)\n**Total Value: 820**\n\nMy previous offer was [5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick].\nValue offered: (5 * 5) + (3 * 9) = 25 + 27 = 52\nValue requested: (1 * 20) = 20\nThis was a bad offer for Player 1, as I was asking for something of much lower value than what I offered. They probably saw that. I need to make an offer that is at least somewhat balanced, or even slightly favorable to them if I want them to accept.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep. My Ore quantity is low, but it's very valuable. Brick is also valuable. I want to acquire more of the high-value items (Ore, Brick, Sheep) if possible, or trade away low-value items for higher-value ones.\n\nLet's try to offer some of my abundant lower-value resources for a higher-value resource, but make the trade more appealing for Player 1.\n\nConsider offering a larger quantity of low-value resources for one high-value resource.\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of Wheat and Wood for some Ore or Brick?\n\nOption 1: Trade [Wheat, Wood] for [Ore]\nLet's try to get 1 Ore (value 35).\nTo make it appealing, I should offer something around 30-40 value in Wheat/Wood.\n[3 Wheat, 3 Wood] = (3*5) + (3*9) = 15 + 27 = 42. This seems more reasonable.\n\nOption 2: Trade [Wheat, Wood] for [Brick]\nLet's try to get 1 Brick (value 20).\n[2 Wheat, 1 Wood] = (2*5) + (1*9) = 10 + 9 = 19. This is close to 20. Maybe [3 Wheat] = 15, or [4 Wheat] = 20.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep as well. Maybe I can leverage that.\nWhat if Player 1 is short on Sheep or desires them?\n\nI will try to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to Player 1, to encourage a first trade, especially since my prior offer was so bad. I want to signal that I'm willing to trade.\n\nLet's offer a slight overpay for a very valuable resource, given my current low quantity of Ore.\nI'll offer Wheat and Wood for Ore.\n\nNew Offer:\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (6 * 5) + (4 * 9) = 30 + 36 = 66\nValue requested: 1 * 35 = 35\nThis is still quite a significant overpay on my part, but it might entice Player 1 to accept or at least counter with something closer to parity. My goal is to get the trade started and acquire more valuable resources. I have plenty of Wheat and Wood to spare.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
