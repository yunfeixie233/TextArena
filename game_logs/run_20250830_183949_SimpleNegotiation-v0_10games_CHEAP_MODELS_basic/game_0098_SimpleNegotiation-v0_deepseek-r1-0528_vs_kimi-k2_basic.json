      "response": "### Turn Summary So Far:\n- **Starting resources (Player 1)**: 12 Wheat (6), 7 Wood (9), 7 Sheep (12), 11 Brick (26), 14 Ore (36). Total value: 6 + 9 + 12 + 26 + 36 = 89.\n- **Turns 1-3**:\n  - Turn 1: Player 0 offered [3 Sheep, 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]. I denied it.\n    - This would have been a loss for me: Giving 3 Sheep (12*3=36) and 2 Ore (36*2=72) = 108 value lost. Gaining 5 Brick (26*5=130) and 2 Sheep (12*2=24) = 154 value gained. Net +46, but this is deceptive because Sheep value per unit is 12, and I'm giving away unique resources (Sheep and Ore) for Brick which I already have plenty of (11 Brick). This would skew my holdings toward Brick, which isn't optimal.\n  - Turn 2: I made no offer. Player 0 denied my lack of offer (standard procedure).\n  - Turn 3: Player 0 offered [2 Ore \u2192 3 Brick]. I denied.\n    - Giving 2 Ore (36*2=72) for 3 Brick (26*3=78). Net +6 value, but again, I have 11 Brick and 14 Ore. Decreasing my high-value Ore for more Brick isn't beneficial.\n\n### Analysis of My Holdings:\n- **Overstocked in Brick and Ore relative to other resources**:\n  - Brick: 11 (way above others). Its value is 26, but having too many is inefficient.\n  - Ore: 14 (highest qty and value), but not sensible to trade away for less valuable resources unless gaining flexibility.\n- **Understocked in Wheat and Wood**: Only 12 Wheat (6 value) and 7 Wood (9 value). These are cheap but necessary for balance.\n- **Sheep** is at 7, which is fine, but could be traded if getting better value.\n\n### Strategy:\nI need to **reduce Brick (11 is excessive)** and **increase Wheat/Wood** which are low-value individually but crucial when low. I also can't overtrade high-value Ore unless I'm gaining significant value elsewhere.\n\n### Best Trade I Can Offer Now:\nI want to **trade Brick for Wheat and Wood**, since I have Brick in surplus. A fair exchange:\n- **Drip Brick at high ratios to get low-cost Wheat/Wood**.\n- Example: 2 Brick (52 value) for 5 Wheat (30 value) and 2 Wood (18 value) is bad (52 vs 48 net -4), but Brick is overstocked so acceptable.\n\nBut a better approach is to **target Wheat/Wood with Brick**. Here's a calibrated offer:\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick \u2192 4 Wheat, 2 Wood]\n- Giving: 2 Brick (26*2=52)\n- Getting: 4 Wheat (6*4=24) and 2 Wood (9*2=18). Total 42.\n- Net: -10 in strict value, but improves resource balance by reducing Brick surplus and increasing Wheat/Wood. This is likely acceptable to Player 0.\n\nAlternatively, to **negotiate higher**:\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick \u2192 5 Wheat, 3 Wood]\n- Giving: 3 Brick (78)\n- Getting: 5 Wheat (30) + 3 Wood (27) = 57.\n- Net: -21 value, but aligns with needs. Player 0 is unlikely to accept, so start conservative.\n\n### Final Offer:\nStart with the **first offer**:\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick \u2192 4 Wheat, 2 Wood]\n\nThis is a **net loss of 10 value**, but I trade 2 high-quantity Brick for Wheat/Wood I desperately lack. If denied, I can iterate.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick, 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Ore -> 4 Wheat, 2 Wood, 0 Brick, 0 Sheep, 0 Ore]",
