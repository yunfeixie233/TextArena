Given the current values:\n- The highest value resource is Ore (Value: 40).\n- The lowest value resource is Wheat (Value: 5).\n\n### Initial Trade Offer\n\nLet's start by offering some of our lower-value or less valuable resources in exchange for Ore or other high-value resources if possible. Since we already have a considerable amount of Ore, we might look to consolidate or slightly increase it, but our primary goal is to increase the total value.\n\nWe have a lot of Wood (Value: 11) and Sheep (Value: 13), which are relatively lower in value compared to Brick (Value: 23) and Ore (Value: 40). Let's consider making an offer that involves trading some of our less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\n### Offer\n\nLet's offer 5 Wood and 2 Sheep for 3 Brick.\n- We are giving up: (5*11) + (2*13) = 55 + 26 = 81\n- We are requesting: 3*23 = 69 (in Brick)\n\nThis initial thought doesn't seem beneficial as we're losing value. Let's reconsider.\n\n### Alternative Offer\n\nLet's think about offering some Wheat (the lowest value resource) and some other relatively lower-value resources for something more valuable.\n\n- Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore\n  - Giving up: (5*5) + (2*13) = 25 + 26 = 51\n  - Requesting: 2*40 = 80\n\nThis seems like a good trade as we're gaining more value than we're giving up.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]`\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.",

However, I need to be cautious about what I'm willing to give away.\n\n3. **Formulate a Trade Offer**:\n   - I can try to offer resources that are relatively less valuable to me but could be valuable to the other player. For instance, Wood (Value: 11) is less valuable than Ore (Value: 40), so offering Wood for Ore could be beneficial.\n   - Considering my resources, an offer like '[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' could be reasonable. This offer gives away resources worth (2*11) + (1*13) = 22 + 13 = 35 and gains resources worth 1*40 = 40, resulting in a net gain of 5.\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nGiven the current state and analysis, my next action will be to make a trade offer to Player 1.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis action follows the required format and aims to increase the total value of my resources.\n\n### Action in Required Format\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Analysis of the Current State\n\nTo determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the current state of resources and the history of trades.\n\n#### Current Resources and Values\n\n- Wheat: 0 (5 - 5)\n- Wood: 22 (25 - 3)\n- Sheep: 18 (19 + 2 - 1)\n- Brick: 13 (8 + 5)\n- Ore: 10 (9 + 1)\n\n#### Previous Trades and Outcomes\n\n1. Offered 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep for 2 Ore: Rejected.\n2. Offered 3 Wood, 1 Sheep for 1 Ore: Rejected (twice).\n3. Accepted an offer from Player 1: Received 3 Wood, 1 Sheep in exchange for 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep.\n4. Offered 2 Wood, 1 Sheep for 1 Ore: Rejected.\n\n### Strategy\n\nThe goal is to increase the total value of the resources. Let's examine the current total value and think about potential trades.\n\n#### Current Total Value\n\n- Wheat: 0 * 5 = 0\n- Wood: 22 * 11 = 242\n- Sheep: 18 * 13 = 234\n- Brick: 13 * 23 = 299\n- Ore: 10 * 40 = 400\n\nTotal Value = 0 + 242 + 234 + 299 + 400 = 1175\n\n#### Potential Trades\n\nGiven the rejections and the last accepted trade, we should reassess what we're offering and what we could potentially gain.\n\n1. **Focus on gaining Ore**: Ore has the highest value. Previous attempts to get Ore were rejected, but we can try adjusting our offer.\n   \n2. **Consider the opponent's perspective**: Player 1 was willing to give 3 Wood, 1 Sheep for 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep. This indicates they might value Sheep and Wheat or were looking to complete a set.\n\n### Next Action\n\nLet's think about making a new offer that could be more appealing to Player 1, focusing on resources they might value or need.\n\n1. We could offer some Brick (since we have a surplus after the last trade) for Ore.\n   \n2. Another option is to offer Wood or Sheep for Ore, adjusting the quantities to be more appealing.\n\nGiven that our last offer for Ore was rejected, let's adjust our strategy:\n\n- We have Brick, which we could offer. Let's consider offering some Brick for Ore.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n\nLet's offer 2 Brick for 1 Ore. This is a reasonable trade since Ore is highly valued, and giving away Brick (while valuable) is less costly than previously attempted trades for Ore.\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick, -> 1 Ore]\n\nHowever, to follow the format, the correct representation of the action should be:\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nLet's make this trade offer. \n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
