I should also propose a counter-offer.\n\nI need to make an offer that increases my total resource value.\nI have a lot of Wood and Brick. I also have some Sheep. Ore is highly valuable.\n\nLet's consider offering some of my less valuable resources to get more valuable ones.\n\nOffer: 5 Wood, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore\nMy offer value: (5 * 9) + (1 * 23) = 45 + 23 = 68\nMy requested value: (1 * 37) = 37\nThis means I lose value in requested. This is not how it works.\n\nI should request items that are higher in value than what I offer.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nI have 9 Brick (value 23), 19 Wood (value 9), 6 Sheep (value 14).\n\nOffer: 2 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore\nValue offered: (2 * 23) + (1 * 14) = 46 + 14 = 60\nValue requested: (1 * 37) = 37\nThis means I offer 60 for 37. This is bad for me. It means I am losing 23 value.\n\nLet's try to get resources that are more valuable to me. I have many wood which is cheap. Player 0 rejected previous offer.\n\nLet's try to offer a smaller amount of higher value resources for some ore.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nMy offered value: (2 * 14) + (3 * 9) = 28 + 27 = 55\nMy requested value: (1 * 37) = 37\nThis is again offering more value than I receive. I need to make an offer that is good for me.\n\nThe goal is to increase the value of my resources. To do this, I must acquire resources with a higher total value than the resources I give away.\n\nLet's assume Player 0 might be low on something specific. I don't know that.\nI have plenty of Wood and Brick. Ore is very valuable. Sheep is moderately valuable.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of low-value items for a smaller quantity of high-value items?\n\nOffer: 7 Wood, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore\nValue offered: (7 * 9) + (1 * 23) = 63 + 23 = 86\nValue requested: (1 * 37) = 37\nThis is still losing value for me.\n\nI need to phrase the offer such that Player 0 is giving me more value than I am giving them.\n\nLet's rethink my strategy. My goal is to increase my net worth.\n\nHow about I request something less valuable than Ore? Like Sheep or Brick.\n\nMy strategy should be to offer items that are plentiful and relatively low-value for me (like Wood or Wheat), and request items that are of higher value (like Ore or Brick, or even Sheep if the exchange rate is good).\n\nWhat about: [Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Sheep]\nValue offered: 5 * 9 = 45\nValue requested: 1 * 14 = 14\nThis is bad for me. I need to get *more* value than I give.\n\nCorrect Offer Structure for Me: Offered Resources (total value X) -> Requested Resources (total value Y), where Y > X.\n\nExample: Want to get 1 Ore (Value 37).\nWhat can I give to make this profitable for me?\nMaybe 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat?\nValue: (1 * 14) + (1 * 6) = 20.\nIf I offer 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat for 1 Ore, I gain 37 - 20 = 17 value.

      "response": "Given the current resources and previous interactions, I aim to increase my total value by trading low-value resources for higher-value ones. My Wood and Sheep are in surplus, but trading Sheep requires careful consideration since they hold moderate value. Player 1 has shown interest in Wood-for-Sheep trades, having previously offered 3 Wood for 1 Sheep (which I rejected then) and rejected my earlier 1-Sheep-for-3-Wood offer. To capitalize on their evident valuation and maximize gain, I'll propose a slightly improved offer: requesting 1 extra Wood per Sheep. This trade converts Sheep into Wood at a favorable rate, yielding a net value increase.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 4 Wood]",
