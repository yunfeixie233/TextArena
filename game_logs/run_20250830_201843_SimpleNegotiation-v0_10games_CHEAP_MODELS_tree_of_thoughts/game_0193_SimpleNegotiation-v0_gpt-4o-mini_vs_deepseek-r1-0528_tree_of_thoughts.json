Player 0 has consistently rejected offers involving Sheep-to-Brick/Ore trades, suggesting they may value Sheep lowly or have limited Brick/Ore. To increase my total value, I'll switch strategy and leverage my excess Wood (low value for mee) to target Ore (higher value). While Ore trades haven't been tried yet with Wood, I'll propose Wood + Sheep, masating the offer to make it appealing.\n\n**New Trade Proposal**: Offer **3 Wood and 4 Sheep** for **1 Ore**.  \n- My valuation: Giving \u2192 (3\u00d710 + 4\u00d712) = 30 + 48 = 78 points  \n- Received \u2192 38 points  \n- Though Lose 40 points short-term, this might open negotiations for Ore-centric deals. Given Sheep's low value and abundance, this calculated risk might reveal Player 0's preferences.  \n\nLet's test this approach to gather intel.\n\nOffer: [Offer: 3 Wood, 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
