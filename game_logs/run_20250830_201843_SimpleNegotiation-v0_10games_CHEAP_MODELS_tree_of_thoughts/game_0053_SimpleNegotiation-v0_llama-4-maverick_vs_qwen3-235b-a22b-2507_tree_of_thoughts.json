The values are: Wheat (5), Wood (11), Sheep (13), Brick (26), Ore (34).\n   \n2. **Trade Strategy**: \n   - I should try to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values.\n   - Given the current values, Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, then Sheep, Wood, and Wheat.\n\n3. **Possible Trades**: \n   - Trading Wheat (5) for any other resource is beneficial.\n   - Trading Wood (11) for Sheep (13), Brick (26), or Ore (34) is beneficial.\n   - Trading Sheep (13) for Brick (26) or Ore (34) is beneficial.\n\n### First Turn Action\nI will start by making an offer that trades lower-value resources for higher-value ones. Given my resources, I can offer Wheat (the least valuable resource) for something more valuable.\n\nLet's offer 5 Wheat for 1 Wood (though not the best trade, it's a start to get something more valuable than Wheat). However, a more beneficial trade would be to directly offer for something more valuable.\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]' is a potential offer since Sheep is more valuable than Wood, and I have plenty of Wheat.\n\n### Action\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]' \n\nLet's see the opponent's response.",

Our goal is to maximize the total value of our resources.\n\n2. **Analyze Previous Offers:** \n   - The first offer (5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep) was rejected. Wheat is valued at 5, and Sheep is valued at 13. The offer was 25 for 13, which is not favorable.\n   - The second offer (4 Sheep -> 1 Ore) was also rejected. Here, we offered 52 (4*13) for 34 (1*34), which is again not favorable.\n\n3. **Consider New Offers:** \n   - We need to think about what we can offer that might be more appealing to Player 1 while also being beneficial or at least not significantly detrimental to us.\n   - Given the values, trading low-value items for higher-value ones is ideal.\n\n4. **Potential Trades:**\n   - Consider trading some Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 11) for higher-value items like Ore (Value: 34) or Brick (Value: 26).\n   - Since our previous offer for Ore was rejected when we offered Sheep, we might need to rethink the quantity or the resources we're offering.\n\n### New Offer\n\nLet's analyze the possibility of offering some Wheat or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\n- **Proposed Trade:** Offer 6 Wood -> Request 1 Ore\n  - We are offering 6 Wood (6*11 = 66) for 1 Ore (1*34 = 34). This is not a good trade for us as it decreases our total value significantly.\n\n- **Alternative Trade:** Offer 3 Wheat -> Request 1 Brick\n  - We are offering 3 Wheat (3*5 = 15) for 1 Brick (1*26 = 26). This increases our total value and could be a reasonable trade.\n\n### Action\n\nGiven the above analysis, let's make a new offer:\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 1 Brick, 0 Ore]`\n\nThus, the action in the required format is:\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`",

Given Ore's value (34) is higher than Brick's (26), offering 2 Ore might be too costly, but it depends on how much we value getting more Brick.\n\nLet's propose a trade:\n`[Offer: 1 Ore, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick]`\n\nThis is a balanced trade considering the values and the resources we have. We are offering resources worth (1*34 + 2*13) = 60 for 2 Brick worth (2*26) = 52. While it might not be the most favorable in terms of immediate value, it could be a starting point for negotiation.\n\n### Response\n\n`[Offer: 1 Ore, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick]`",

      "response": "### Current State Analysis\n\n#### Resources and Values\n\nAfter the last trade, the current state of resources and their associated values for Player 0 is as follows:\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 19 - 3 = 16, Value: 5  \n  Total Value = 16 * 5 = 80\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 6, Value: 11  \n  Total Value = 6 * 11 = 66\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 16 + 5 - 4 - 2 = 15, Value: 13  \n  Total Value = 15 * 13 = 195\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 8 - 1 = 7, Value: 26  \n  Total Value = 7 * 26 = 182\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 13 - 1 = 12, Value: 34  \n  Total Value = 12 * 34 = 408\n\n#### Total Value Calculation\n\nTotal Value = 80 (Wheat) + 66 (Wood) + 195 (Sheep) + 182 (Brick) + 408 (Ore) = 931\n\n### Game State and Turn Information\n\n- Current Turn: Not explicitly stated, but based on the sequence of events, it is the 6th turn (since there were 5 previous interactions involving offers and counter-offers).\n- Total Turns: 10\n\n### Next Action\n\nTo decide on the next action, we need to evaluate the current resources and their values, and compare the potential trades.\n\n1. **Evaluate Current Resources and Values**: The current total value is 931. We need to increase this value.\n   \n2. **Potential Trades**: We should look for trades that increase our total value. Given the values of resources:\n   - The most valuable resources are Ore (34) and Brick (26).\n   - Sheep (13) and Wood (11) are moderately valuable.\n   - Wheat (5) is the least valuable.\n\n3. **Trade Strategy**:\n   - We should try to get more Ore or Brick if possible, as they are highly valued.\n   - We can offer resources like Wheat or Sheep, which we have in relatively good quantity, for more valuable resources.\n\n4. **Previous Offers and Outcomes**:\n   - Our previous offers were not accepted, indicating either the quantities were not favorable or the requested resources were not available to Player 1.\n   - The last trade we accepted was beneficial (gained 5 Sheep and lost 3 Wheat and 1 Brick), indicating that negotiating for Sheep or other resources in exchange for Wheat or Brick could be fruitful.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n\nLet's formulate a trade that could potentially increase our total value. \n\nGiven our current quantities and values:\n- Offering 2 Wheat (Value: 2*5 = 10) for 1 Ore (Value: 34) would be beneficial as it increases our total value by 24.\n  \nTherefore, a potential trade offer could be:\n```\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n```\n\n### Action\n\n```\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n```",
