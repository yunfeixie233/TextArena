Current Value of Resources:\n   - Wheat: 4 * 5 = 20\n   - Wood: 18 * 8 = 144\n   - Sheep: 8 * 17 = 136\n   - Brick: 25 * 28 = 700\n   - Ore: 16 * 36 = 576\n   - **Total: 20 + 144 + 136 + 700 + 576 = 1576**\n\n2. After accepting Player 1's offer:\n   - I would give away 3 Wood (Value: 3 * 8 = 24)\n   - I would gain 1 Brick (Value: 28)\n\n**Change in Value:**\n- **Before trade total:** 1576\n- **After trade total:** 1576 - 24 + 28 = 1580\n\nSince accepting this offer increases my total resource value, I will proceed to accept it.\n\n**Action:**\n[Accept]",
