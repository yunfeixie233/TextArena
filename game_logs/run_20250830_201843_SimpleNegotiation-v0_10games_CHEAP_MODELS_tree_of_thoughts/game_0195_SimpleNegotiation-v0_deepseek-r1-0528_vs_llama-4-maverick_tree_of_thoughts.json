To maximize my resource value, I should aim to give resources of lower value and receive resources of higher value.\n\nMy current resources and values are:\n- Sheep: 9 (Value: 14 each)\n- Ore: 16 (Value: 40 each)\n- Brick: 13 (Value: 26 each)\n- Wood: 20 (Value: 8 each)\n- Wheat: 8 (Value: 6 each)\n\nA potential trade could involve offering resources that are relatively less valuable to me and requesting more valuable ones. One such trade could be giving some Wood (since it's one of the less valuable resources) and possibly some Wheat, and asking for Sheep or Ore, which are more valuable.\n\nHowever, since I already have a considerable amount of Ore and a moderate amount of Sheep, I should be cautious not to overdo it. Let's think about what I can offer and what I can ask for.\n\nOne possible trade is:\n- Offer: 4 Wood (Value: 4 * 8 = 32), 2 Wheat (Value: 2 * 6 = 12) -> Request: 1 Ore (Value: 1 * 40 = 40)\n\nTotal offered value = 32 + 12 = 44\nTotal requested value = 40\n\nThis is not a very favorable trade for me since I'm giving more value than I'm receiving. Let's consider an alternative.\n\nAnother possible trade is:\n- Offer: 2 Sheep (Value: 2 * 14 = 28) -> Request: 1 Ore (Value: 1 * 40 = 40)\n\nTotal offered value = 28\nTotal requested value = 40\n\nThis trade seems more favorable as I'm receiving a higher value than I'm giving.\n\nLet's go with the second option:\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nSo, my action for this turn is:\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Given the current resource state and the goal to maximize total value, I propose a trade that capitalizes on the high per-unit value of Ore (approximately 2.92 per unit) compared to Brick (1.3 per unit). Offering Brick for Ore is highly advantageous: trading 3 Brick (total value 3 * 1.3 = 3.9) for 2 Ore (total value 2 * 2.92 = 5.84) yields a net gain of 1.94 in value. This builds on previous successful trades where the opponent accepted Sheep for Ore, suggesting openness to resource exchanges. With ample Brick reserves (current: 17), this trade is sustainable and aligns with the strategy of offloading lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]",
