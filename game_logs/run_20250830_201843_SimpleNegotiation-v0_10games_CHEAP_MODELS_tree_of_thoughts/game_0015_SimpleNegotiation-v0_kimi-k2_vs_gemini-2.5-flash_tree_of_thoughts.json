My wheat is relatively low value, and I have a decent amount. Sheep is of moderate value. I can definitely try to get more for my wheat.\n\nLet's try to get something more valuable for my Wheat, or trade a smaller amount of higher-value items. I have a lot of Ore and Brick.\n\nGiven I have a lot of Ore and it has the highest value, I'm going to hold onto it unless I can get something even better. Brick is also high value and I have a lot.\n\nI will try to get more valuable resources or resources I have less of, especially if I can get them at a good rate.\n\nLet's value the trade more precisely this time.\n2 Wheat = 12\n1 Sheep = 14\n\nThe previous offer was slightly in my favor but not by much, which likely explains the rejection.\n\nHere is my next move:\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood]\n\nReasoning:\nValue of 2 Wheat = 12\nValue of 1 Wood = 11\n\nThis time the offer is almost even in terms of a strict value trade, but I am giving up a lower-value resource (Wheat) for a slightly higher-value resource (Wood). Wood is also something I have a lot of, so acquiring more isn't a problem, and if I can get it for cheap, it's good.\n\nThis trade is very close in value (12 vs 11). It's possible Player 0 might accept this if they are trying to get rid of Wood and need Wheat.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to offload some of my excess resources for something I need more. I have a lot of Wood, Ore, and Brick. I have the least amount of Sheep and Wheat.\n\nLet's reconsider. Maybe I should target what I have the least of, or try to offload an excess of high-value resources for other high-value resources.\n\nMy main goal is to increase the total value of my resources. If I can trade something I have a lot of for something I have less of, and increase its value, that's ideal.\n\nLet's think about gaining value.\nIf I give 2 Wheat (value 12) for 1 Sheep (value 14), that's a +2 value gain for me. (This was my previous offer).\nIf I give 2 Wheat (value 12) for 1 Wood (value 11), that's a -1 value loss for me. Not good.\n\nI need to make an offer that increases my overall value.\n\nWhat if I tried to trade some of my excess high-value resources for other high-value resources or resources I have less of?\n\nI have 17 Wood (Value 11) and 17 Brick (Value 28) and 21 Ore (Value 35).\nI have only 7 Sheep (Value 14) and 10 Wheat (Value 6).\n\nIf I trade 1 Wood (11) for 1 Sheep (14), that's a +3 value gain. This seems like a strong offer for me. I have many Wood, and few Sheep.\n\n[Offer: 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep]",
