      "response": "Since the task is to increase the total value of the resources and the current resources are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 14   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 22   Value: 9\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 18   Value: 16\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 31   Value: 22\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 7   Value: 33\n\nLet's analyze the current situation and the last offer made by Player 0.\n\n1. **Current Total Value**: \n   - Wheat: 14 * 5 = 70\n   - Wood: 22 * 9 = 198\n   - Sheep: 18 * 16 = 288\n   - Brick: 31 * 22 = 682\n   - Ore: 7 * 33 = 231\n   - Total = 70 + 198 + 288 + 682 + 231 = 1469\n\n2. **Last Offer**:\n   - Offered items: 1 Ore -> Requested items: 2 Brick\n   - Value of Offered items: 1 * 33 = 33\n   - Value of Requested items: 2 * 22 = 44\n\nSince the value of the requested items (44) is greater than the value of the offered items (33), accepting this trade would increase the total value of the resources.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Accept the offer: '[Accept]'\n   - And make a new offer to further increase the total value.\n\nLet's make a new offer. We should look to trade resources in a way that we get a higher value. One possible trade could involve offering Wheat (lowest value per unit) and getting something of higher value.\n\nFor example, we could offer:\n- '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]' \n   - Value given: 5 * 5 = 25\n   - Value received: 1 * 16 = 16 (This is not beneficial)\n   \nOr a more beneficial trade:\n- '[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]' \n   - Value given: (2 * 9) + (1 * 5) = 18 + 5 = 23\n   - Value received: 1 * 16 = 16 (Still not beneficial)\n\nLet's directly analyze a potentially beneficial trade:\n- We have a lot of Brick now, so offering some Brick for Ore or other high-value resources could be good.\n- '[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]' \n   - Value given: 2 * 22 = 44\n   - Value received: 1 * 33 = 33 (Not beneficial)\n\nHowever, considering our current resources and the last offer, let's directly go with accepting the last offer and then think of a more strategic offer.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Accept the last offer: '[Accept]'\n2. Make a new offer: Considering our analysis, we need to think of a beneficial trade. Let's directly propose a potentially good trade: '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood]' is not good as Wood's value is lower than Sheep. Let's think about something involving our lower-value items and trying to get higher-value ones.\n\nLet's directly output the response in the required format:\n'[Accept]'\n'[Offer: 4 Brick, 1 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]' \n\nThis offer gives up some Brick (which we have a lot of) and some Wheat (lowest value resource), to get Sheep (higher value than Wheat and Wood). Let's see how the values add up:\n- Value given: (4 * 22) + (1 * 5) = 88 + 5 = 93\n- Value received: 2 * 16 = 32 (This is not a good trade as it stands)\n\nLet's revise the thought process and directly give a potentially beneficial trade:\n'[Accept]'\n'[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' \n   - Value given: 3 * 5 = 15\n   - Value received: 1 * 33 = 33\n\nThis seems more beneficial.\n\nThe final answer is: \n'[Accept]'\n'[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'",
