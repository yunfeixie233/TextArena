Offered 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep to Player 1. Response: Rejected.\n  2. Offered 4 Wood for 1 Sheep to Player 1. Response: Rejected.\n\n### Reasoning for the Next Move\n\n1. **Understanding Player 1's Interests:**\n   - Player 1 rejected both offers for 1 Sheep, indicating that either they don't need Sheep or they are not willing to trade for it at the offered rates.\n\n2. **Alternative Trade Options:**\n   - Since acquiring Sheep seems challenging, let's consider other valuable resources or alternatives that could be beneficial.\n\n3. **Resource Value Analysis:**\n   - The highest value resources we have are Ore (Value: 39) and Brick (Value: 24).\n   - The next highest value resource is Sheep (Value: 15), which we are trying to acquire more of.\n\n4. **Formulating a New Offer:**\n   - Considering Player 1's rejections, a new strategy could be to offer resources that are of lower value to us but potentially higher value to Player 1, or to directly offer a more appealing trade.\n\n### New Trade Offer\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- Offering some Wheat or Wood for other resources might not be effective given previous rejections for Sheep.\n- Consider offering a less valuable resource or a combination that includes a valuable resource we're willing to part with.\n\n### Potential Trade\n\nGiven that we want to increase the total value of our resources and considering our previous attempts were rejected, let's directly target a trade involving our high-value resources or adjust our strategy to offer something that might be more acceptable.\n\nLet's make a new offer: `[Offer: 2 Brick, 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep]`\n\nThis offer involves giving away some of our high-value resources (Brick and Ore) for more Sheep, which is also valuable. The quantities are chosen to potentially be more appealing to Player 1, as we're offering a mix of high and moderate-value resources.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 2 Brick, 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep]`\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds to this offer.",
