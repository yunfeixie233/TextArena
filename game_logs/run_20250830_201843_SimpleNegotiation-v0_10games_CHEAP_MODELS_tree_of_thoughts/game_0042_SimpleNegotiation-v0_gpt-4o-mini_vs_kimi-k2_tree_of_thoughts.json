      "response": "Based on the current situation, it is essential to analyze the trades and resources carefully. \n\nCurrently, after accepting the trades from Player 1, Player 0's resources are as follows:\n\n- Wheat: 11 - 4 (from accepted trade) - 5 (from accepted trade) = 2 Wheat\n- Wood: 5\n- Sheep: 7 (no changes)\n- Brick: 0 + 10 (from accepted trade) = 10 Brick\n- Ore: 10 - 2 (from accepted trade) + 1 (from accepted trade) = 9 Ore\n\nNow the available resources are:\n- Wheat: 2\n- Wood: 5\n- Sheep: 7\n- Brick: 10\n- Ore: 9\n\nAs for Player 1's latest offer of 4 Brick for 1 Ore and 2 Wheat:\n\n**Evaluation of Player 1's Offer:**\n- Offering 4 Brick (which has a value of 26) for 1 Ore (value 37) and 2 Wheat (value 12) is an unbalanced trade.\n- Total values: 4 Brick (Value: 26) is far less valuable than what Player 1 seeks (1 Ore + 2 Wheat; Total Value: 49).\n  \nWith this in mind, it would be prudent to **reject** the trade offer from Player 1 as it does not provide a beneficial outcome.\n\nTherefore, the next action is:\n\n[Deny]",
