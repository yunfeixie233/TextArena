      "response": "Given the current state, I need to propose a trade that increases my total resource value. After reviewing past trades, Player 1 has consistently accepted Sheep-for-Brick deals (5 Sheep for 3 Brick), which benefited me due to Brick's higher value (24 vs. Sheep's 12). However, I now only have 3 Sheep left.  \n\nA 3 Sheep for 2 Brick trade would be profitable:  \n- **Loss**: 3 Sheep \u00d7 12 = 36  \n- **Gain**: 2 Brick \u00d7 24 = 48  \n- **Net gain**: +12  \n\nPlayer 1 has shown interest in Sheep, and this ratio (1.5 Sheep per Brick) is slightly better for them than previous trades (~1.67 Sheep per Brick), increasing acceptance chances. I\u2019ll prioritize this over speculative Wheat/Wood trades, which carry higher risk.  \n\n**Offer**:  \n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",
