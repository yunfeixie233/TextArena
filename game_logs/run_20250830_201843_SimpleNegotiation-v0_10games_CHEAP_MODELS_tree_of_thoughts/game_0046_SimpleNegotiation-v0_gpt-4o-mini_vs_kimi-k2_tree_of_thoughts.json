After accepted trades:  \n     Start \u2192 after first two trades my resources changed as follows without doing the rejected ones. Hence start after second trade onward:\n     Brick 16 \u2013 5 + 2 (had 5 more taken, 2 gained back from 3rd?) \u2192 11 actually, Wood 14 \u2013 4 + 3 \u2013 2 = 11, Ore 21 \u2013 1 \u2192 20, Sheep 12 + 2 = 14.\n\n3.

But Player 0 just gave me Brick for Wood again suggesting they value Wood higher or Brick lower.  \n\n5. To maximize value I need to skew toward highest marginal value resources: Ore and Brick. I'll try a small ask to enlarge my Ore pile without giving away scarce higher-valued items.\n\n6. Offer: I\u2019m willing to give 1 Sheep (Value = 15) and 2 Wood (Value = 18) in exchange for 2 Ore (Value = 38 each = 76).
