      "response": "My total value of resources is: (9 * 6) + (23 * 11) + (6 * 17) + (15 * 28) + (19 * 33) = 54 + 253 + 102 + 420 + 627 = 1456\n\nI want to increase the total value of my resources.\nI will try to trade resources with lower value for resources with higher value.\nLooking at my resources and their values:\n[Wheat]   Value: 6\n[Wood]    Value: 11\n[Sheep]   Value: 17\n[Brick]   Value: 28\n[Ore]     Value: 33\n\nI have a good quantity of Wood, Brick, and Ore.\nI have a low quantity of Wheat and Sheep.\n\nMy strategy is to trade Wood for higher-valued resources like Brick or Ore, or perhaps trade Brick for Ore. I could also trade some of my excess resources for Sheep if the value exchange is good.\nI will start with an offer that favors me slightly, but still might be appealing to my opponent. I will try to get more valuable resources for less valuable ones.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nThis trade would mean giving up 5 * 11 = 55 value for 1 * 33 = 33 value. This is a bad trade for me. I need to get more value.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. I want to *increase* my total value.\nSo, I should offer resources with lower value for resources with higher value.\nI have 23 Wood (value 11). This is my least valuable abundant resource.\nI have 9 Wheat (value 6). This is my absolute least valuable resource, but I only have 9.\n\nI want to acquire Brick (28) or Ore (33).\nThe ratio I'm aiming for is to gain more value than I give up.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood for Brick or Ore.\nIf I offer 3 Wood (3 * 11 = 33 value) for 1 Ore (33 value), this is an even trade. I want to gain value.\nIf I offer 2 Wood (2 * 11 = 22 value) for 1 Brick (28 value), that's a gain of 6 value.\nIf I offer 3 Wood (3 * 11 = 33 value) for 1 Brick (28 value) + 1 Sheep (17 value) = 45. That's good.\n\nMy goal is to increase my own resources. So I need to be careful with my trade offers.\n\nLet's try to trade resources where I have a good quantity and which have a lower value.\nI have 23 Wood (Value 11).\nI have 15 Brick (Value 28).\nI have 19 Ore (Value 33).\n\nI want to obtain Ore and Brick, as they are high value.\nI can offer Wood in exchange.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick]\nValue Offered: 3 * 11 = 33\nValue Requested: 1 * 28 = 28\nThis doesn't increase my value. I'm losing 5 value here.\n\nI should offer less value than I receive.\nLet's offer a combination of lower value resources.\nI have lots of Wood. I also have a lot of Ore and Brick.\n\nLet's consider trading Wheat first, as it's my lowest valued resource and I have 9 of it.\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood]\nValue Offered: 2 * 6 = 12\nValue Requested: 1 * 11 = 11\nThis doesn't increase my value.\n\nOkay, I need to craft an offer that gives me a clear value increase.\nI have a significant amount of Wood and Brick.\nI want more Ore (Value 33).\n\nHow about trading a slightly lower value resource for a higher one?\nLet's try to get Ore.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nValue Offered: 1 * 28 = 28\nValue Requested: 1 * 33 = 33\nValue increase: 5. This is a good offer for me.\n\nLet's try this.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
