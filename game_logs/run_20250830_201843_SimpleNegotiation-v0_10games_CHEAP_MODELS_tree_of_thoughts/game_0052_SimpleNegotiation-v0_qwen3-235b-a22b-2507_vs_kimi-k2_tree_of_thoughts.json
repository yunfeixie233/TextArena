Could consider trading Sheep for Ore or Brick if needed.\n- **Wheat**: 11 units, value 5 is lowest; could accumulate more if it helps gain higher-value resources.\n- **Wood**: 6 units, lowest value (9); might look to trade for higher-value resources.\n\n### Proposed Trade:\nLooking to offload low-value Wheat or Brick for higher-value resources. \n\n- **Brick (21 per unit) to Ore (38 per unit) or Sheep (13 per unit)**: \n  - Offering 3 Brick (total value 63) for 1 Ore (38) is a loss in absolute terms (63 vs 38) but improves *relative* value concentration since Ore is much more valuable per unit. However, we already did this trade twice, so Player 0 might be reluctant.\n- **Wheat (5 per unit) to Sheep or Ore**:\n  - Offering 2 Wheat (10 value) for 1 Sheep (13 value) is slightly favorable. \n  - Offering 2 Wheat (10 value) for 1 Ore (38 value) is a direct 28 value gain for us, likely too steep for Player 0.\n\n### Offer:\nTry to get more Ore or Sheep by giving low-value Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 1 Sheep]  \n(2 Wheat = 10 value, 1 Brick = 21 value; total 31 offered for 1 Sheep = 13 value.  \nPlayer 0 might accept this as it's 31 for 13 in their favor, but we shift low-value Wheat/Brick to medium-value Sheep.)  \n\nHowever, this seems too generous to Player 0. Let me rethink.\n\nBetter:  \n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Sheep]  \n(21 value for 13 value; improves our value concentration as Sheep is 13 vs Brick's 21, but we have excess Brick. Player 0 gains 8 net value.)\n\nThis seems balanced; may be acceptable.\n\n### Final Action:\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Sheep]",
