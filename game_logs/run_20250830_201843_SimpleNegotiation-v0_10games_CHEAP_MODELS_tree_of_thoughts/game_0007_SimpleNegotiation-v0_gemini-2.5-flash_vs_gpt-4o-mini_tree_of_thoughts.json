This still makes me lose value.\nI need to be gaining value directly.\n\nLet's try to bundle low-value items for a high-value item.\nHow about: 5 Wheat (25) -> 1 Sheep (16)? No, gain 5 wheat value, lose 1 sheep value. Bad.\nHow about: 4 Wheat (20) -> 1 Wood (11)? No, lose 9. Bad.\n\nWhat if I offer Brick for Ore, as Ore is my highest value item?\n1 Brick (28) -> 1 Ore (40). This would be good for me. Value gain of 12.\n\nLet's consider Player 1's offer again: 5 Wheat (25) -> 2 Brick (56), 3 Wood (33). They want 2 Brick (56) and 3 Wood (33). They are offering 5 Wheat (25).

This would be a gain of 3.\nI have enough Wheat and Wood. This seems like a reasonable offer.\n\nLet's confirm the current player's request:\nPlayer 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 5 Wheat -> Requested items: 2 Brick, 3 Wood\n\nI will deny the current offer and then make my own.\n\nAction: [Deny].\nMy Offer: [Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
