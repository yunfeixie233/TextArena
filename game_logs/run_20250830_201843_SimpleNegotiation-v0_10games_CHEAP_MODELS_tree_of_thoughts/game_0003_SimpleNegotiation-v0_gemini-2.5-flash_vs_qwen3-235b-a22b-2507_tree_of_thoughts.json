      "response": "I have 20 Wheat, 8 Wood, 6 Sheep, 7 Brick, 8 Ore.\nMy last offer of 10 Wheat, 5 Wood for 3 Ore was rejected. Player 1 made no offers.\n\nPlayer 1 rejected my previous offer, so I should try to make a more appealing offer this turn, or simply adjust the terms slightly. My last offer was for 3 Ore, which is what I still value most. Getting Ore for less valuable resources is key.\n\nMy current total value: (20 * 5) + (8 * 9) + (6 * 16) + (7 * 20) + (8 * 40) = 100 + 72 + 96 + 140 + 320 = 728.\n\nI'm looking to acquire Ore. My last offer was (10 Wheat (50) + 5 Wood (45)) = 95 for 3 Ore (120). This offer was beneficial to me. Player 1 probably rejected it because it was not good enough for them.\n\nLet's try to offer a bit more for less Ore or for the same amount of Ore.\nI could offer 10 Wheat (50), 5 Wood (45) and add some Sheep (16) maybe? So 10 Wheat, 5 Wood, 1 Sheep (95 + 16 = 111) for 3 Ore (120). Still good for me.\n\nMaybe Player 1 wants Brick or Sheep, as opposed to Wheat or Wood. I have 7 Brick and 6 Sheep.\nLet me try to offer some Brick and Wood for Ore.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (60) and 4 Wood (36) = 96 value for 3 Ore (120 value). This still benefits me.\nLet's try to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me but also reasonable for the opponent.\n\nMy last offer was 10 Wheat (50), 5 Wood (45) for 3 Ore (120). My previous offer: 95\nMy current resources: 20 Wheat, 8 Wood, 6 Sheep, 7 Brick, 8 Ore.\n\nPlayer 1 might have a lot of Ore and a scarcity of other resources, or vice-versa.\nLet's try to offer a higher value of my resources for the Ore.\nWhat if I offer 15 Wheat (75) and 5 Wood (45) for 3 Ore (120)? Value 120 for 120. This is a fair trade by value, but still not good enough for me to make a profit.\nI need to make a profit for myself.\n\nLet's increase the quantity of what I'm offering.\nWhat if I offer 10 Wheat, 8 Wood for 3 Ore?\n(10 * 5) + (8 * 9) = 50 + 72 = 122 value for 3 Ore (120). This is almost neutral for me, slightly negative based on raw value. I need to get more value than I give.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of less desired resources for a small amount of Ore?\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\nMy value: (10 * 5) + (5 * 16) = 50 + 80 = 130\nTheir value: (2 * 40) = 80\nThis is too greedy.\n\nLet's adjust my last offer slightly.\nMy last rejected offer was 10 Wheat, 5 Wood for 3 Ore.\nI need to tempt Player 1.\nWhat if I try for 2 Ore instead of 3, and offer something that Player 1 might actually want.\nPlayer 1 might be short on Brick or Sheep.\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]\nMy value: (5 * 16) + (3 * 20) = 80 + 60 = 140\nTheir value: (2 * 40) = 80\nThis is still very greedy from my side.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood and Wheat for something valuable to me, like Ore or Brick.\nI have a lot of Wheat (20) and Wood (8). I want to offload these if possible for more valuable items.\n\nGiven my last offer was rejected, I should increment my offer to make it more appealing to Player 1.\nLast offer: 10 Wheat (50), 5 Wood (45) for 3 Ore (120). Total offered value: 95.\nLet's try: 12 Wheat (60), 5 Wood (45) for 3 Ore (120). Total offered value: 105.\nThis is still profitable for me by 15 value.

This would decrease my total value significantly.\n\nI should try to make an offer that is better for me in terms of value. I have been focusing on getting Ore and Brick. Let's try to get fewer high-value items for more of my lower-value items.\n\nLet's try to trade a significant amount of Wheat for some Ore or Brick.\nI have 20 Wheat.\n1 Ore = 40. 1 Brick = 20.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wheat? It has the lowest value.\nCurrent Wheat: 20.\nLet's offer 10 Wheat, 3 Wood, 2 Sheep for 1 Ore.\nValue of 10 Wheat = 50\nValue of 3 Wood = 27\nValue of 2 Sheep = 32\nTotal: 109. This is still a lot to give for 1 Ore.\n\nLet's retry my earlier strategy, but refine it. I have a lot of Wheat. I also have some Sheep that have decent value.\nLet's offer 10 Wheat, 2 Sheep. Value = 50 + 32 = 82.\nFor 1 Ore + 1 Brick = 40 + 20 = 60.\nThis would still be a loss for me.\n\nThe target is to increase *my* total value. The sum of the value of resources I give must be less than the sum of the value of resources I request.\n\nI need to make a profitable trade for myself.\nIf I give 10 Wheat, the value is 50.\nIf I can get 1 Ore (40) for it, value goes down.\nIf I can get 1 Brick (20) for it, value goes down.\n\nLet's rethink my strategy. I need to make an offer where what I gain is more valuable than what I give up.\nI want to gain high-value items (Ore, Brick), and give low-value items (Wheat, Wood, Sheep).\n\nLet's try to trade my Sheep. They have a value of 16.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (Value 48), can I get 1 Ore (Value 40)? No, value decreases.\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (Value 32), can I get 1 Brick (Value 20)? No, value decreases.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nWhat if I offer a smaller amount of my resources for one Ore?\n\nI am not happy with my previous offers as they were negative value for me.\n\nMy goal is to increase my resource value.\n\nI will offer 5 Wheat (Value 25) and 3 Wood (Value 27) = 52.\nFor 1 Ore (Value 40) and 1 Sheep (Value 16) = 56.\nThis would be a gain of 4 value unit to me. It also reduces some of my very abundant wheat.\nI would gain 1 Ore and 1 Sheep (+40+16 = +56) and lose 5 Wheat and 3 Wood (-25-27 = -52).\nThis is a net gain of 4.\nThis seems like a fair and profitable offer.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]",
