      "response": "### Negotiation Game: Initial Analysis\n\nAs Player 0, my goal is to increase the total value of my resources through trades with my opponent.\n\n#### Initial Resources and Values:\n\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 25   Value: 6\n- [Wood]    Qty: 23   Value: 10\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 21   Value: 12\n- [Brick]   Qty: 5    Value: 29\n- [Ore]     Qty: 10   Value: 40\n\n#### Total Initial Value:\nTo determine the best trades, first, we need to calculate the total initial value of our resources.\n\n- Total Value = (25 * 6) + (23 * 10) + (21 * 12) + (5 * 29) + (10 * 40)\n- Total Value = 150 + 230 + 252 + 145 + 400\n- Total Value = 1177\n\n#### Strategy:\nTo maximize the total value, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but potentially needed by the opponent.\n\n#### Initial Thought:\nGiven the values, we have a good mix of resources. Noticing that [Ore] has the highest value (40), followed by [Brick] (29), and then [Sheep] (12), [Wood] (10), and [Wheat] (6), we should consider what we can offer that might be valuable to the opponent.\n\n#### Turn 1 Action:\nLet's start by making an offer that could potentially benefit both parties. We can observe that we have a relatively low quantity of [Brick] (5). If we can get more [Brick] or other high-value resources, it would be beneficial.\n\nLet's make an offer: `[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]`\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (2 * 12) + (1 * 40) = 24 + 40 = 64, and asks for resources worth (3 * 29) = 87. This is a reasonable trade as we are gaining value.\n\n### Action for Turn 1:\n`[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]`",

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first assess the current state of resources and the outcome of the previous trades.\n\nInitially, you had:\n- Wheat: 25 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 23 (Value: 10)\n- Sheep: 21 (Value: 12)\n- Brick: 5 (Value: 29)\n- Ore: 10 (Value: 40)\n\nThe total initial value is: \n(25*6) + (23*10) + (21*12) + (5*29) + (10*40) = \n150 + 230 + 252 + 145 + 400 = 1177\n\nAfter the trades:\n1. You offered 2 Sheep and 1 Ore for 3 Brick. This was rejected. So, your resources didn't change due to this trade.\n2. You offered 2 Wood and 1 Sheep for 3 Brick. This was accepted. So, your resources changed as follows:\n   - You lost: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep\n   - You gained: 3 Brick\n\nLet's calculate the new quantities:\n- Wheat: 25\n- Wood: 23 - 2 = 21\n- Sheep: 21 - 1 = 20\n- Brick: 5 + 3 = 8\n- Ore: 10\n\nThe new total value is:\n(25*6) + (21*10) + (20*12) + (8*29) + (10*40) = \n150 + 210 + 240 + 232 + 400 = 1232\n\nThe total value increased from 1177 to 1232 after the second trade.\n\nNow, let's analyze the current state and think about the next trade.\n\nCurrent resources:\n- Wheat: 25 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 21 (Value: 10)\n- Sheep: 20 (Value: 12)\n- Brick: 8 (Value: 29)\n- Ore: 10 (Value: 40)\n\nTo maximize the total value, we should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or at least not decrease the total value.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the resources that are abundant and have lower value compared to others.\nWe have a significant amount of Wheat (Value: 6), a moderate amount of Wood (Value: 10), and Sheep (Value: 12). Ore (Value: 40) and Brick (Value: 29) are relatively more valuable.\n\n## Step 2: Determine potential trades based on the current resources and their values.\nSince Ore and Brick are more valuable, we should try not to lose them. We can consider trading Wheat or Wood or Sheep for either Brick or Ore.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a trade offer.\nLet's think about offering some Wheat or Wood for Ore since Ore is very valuable. We have 25 Wheat and 21 Wood. Offering some of these for Ore could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 4: Consider a specific trade.\nIf we offer 5 Wheat (Value: 6*5 = 30) and 2 Wood (Value: 10*2 = 20) for 1 Ore (Value: 40), the total value given is 30 + 20 = 50, and the value received is 40. This isn't beneficial as it decreases our total value.\n\nLet's consider another option: Offering some Sheep for Ore. If we offer 3 Sheep (Value: 12*3 = 36) for 1 Ore (Value: 40), it's a slight gain in value (40 - 36 = 4).\n\n## Step 5: Make a trade offer based on the analysis.\nLet's offer 3 Sheep for 1 Ore.\n\nThe action in the required format is:\n`[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\n`[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`",

      "response": "Since I'm Player 0, let's first summarize my current resources after the previous trades. Initially, I had:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 25   Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 23   Value: 10\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 21   Value: 12\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 5    Value: 29\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 10   Value: 40\n\nAfter the trades:\n1. I offered 2 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 3 Brick. Rejected. (No change)\n2. I offered 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick. Accepted. \n   - So, I lost 2 Wood and 1 Sheep, and gained 3 Brick.\n   - New quantities: \n     + [Wood]    Qty: 23 - 2 = 21\n     + [Sheep]   Qty: 21 - 1 = 20\n     + [Brick]   Qty: 5 + 3 = 8\n3. I offered 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore. Rejected. (No change)\n4. I received an offer: 3 Brick -> 4 Ore. I rejected it. (No change)\n5. I offered 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore. Rejected. (No change)\n\nCurrent quantities:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 25   Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 21   Value: 10\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 20   Value: 12\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 8    Value: 29\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 10   Value: 40\n\nLet's analyze my resources and think about the next trade. I need to increase the total value of my resources.\n\nCurrent total value = (25 * 6) + (21 * 10) + (20 * 12) + (8 * 29) + (10 * 40)\n                    = 150 + 210 + 240 + 232 + 400\n                    = 1232\n\nTo make a beneficial trade, I need to identify what I can offer and what I should request. Since Ore has the highest value and I have a decent amount of it, I should be cautious about trading it away unless I get something of significantly higher total value. I also have a good amount of Sheep and some Brick now after the last accepted trade.\n\nLet's consider making an offer that could be beneficial. One idea is to trade some of my Wheat (lowest value resource) for something more valuable or at least equally valuable.\n\nLet's propose: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe reasoning is that 5 Wheat = 5 * 6 = 30 value, and 1 Ore = 40 value. This is a potentially beneficial trade as I'm gaining 10 value units.\n\nMy action for this turn: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
