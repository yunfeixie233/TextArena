Here's how it breaks down:\n\n- Value of 5 Sheep to Player 1: 5 * 16 = 80\n- Value of 1 Wheat to Player 1: 1 * 6 = 6\n- Total value offered: 86\n\n- Value of 2 Ore to Player 0: 2 * 33 = 66\n\nAs the value of what Player 1 is offering (86) exceeds the value of what they are asking for (66), I will \naccept the trade, despite the fact that I no longer have Sheep.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n'[Accept]'",
