I have a surplus of Brick relative to other resources and a good amount of Ore.

However, I already have a significant amount of Ore. Let's consider offering Wheat or Wood for Ore or Sheep since they are relatively less valuable compared to Ore.\n\n## Step 9: Formulate a new trade offer.\nLet's offer some Wheat for Ore: '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'.\n- Value given: 5 * 5 = 25\n- Value received: 1 * 33 = 33\n\nThis is a beneficial trade since 33 > 25.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Accept][Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]}$",
