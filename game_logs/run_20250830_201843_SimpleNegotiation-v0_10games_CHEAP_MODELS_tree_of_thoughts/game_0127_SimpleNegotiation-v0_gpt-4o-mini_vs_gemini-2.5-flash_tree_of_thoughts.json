I could offer them for Ore.\nMaybe 5 Wheat and 5 Sheep for 1 Ore?\n(5 * 5) + (5 * 18) = 25 + 90 = 115\n1 Ore = 39. This is too much for 1 Ore.\n\nWhat about 3 Sheep for 1 Brick?\nValue given: 3 * 18 = 54\nValue received: 1 * 25 = 25\nStill a negative trade for me.\n\nLet's look at the offer again: 5 Sheep (90) -> 3 Brick (75).\nIt's clearly a bad trade for me. I should deny it.\n\nHow about offering something else for Brick, since Player 0 offered Brick before and is offering again.\n\nMy current resources:\nWheat: 20 (5)\nWood: 8 (8)\nSheep: 16 (18)\nBrick: 19 (25)\nOre: 17 (39)\n\nI want to increase my valuable resources (Brick, Ore) by giving up less valuable ones (Wheat, Sheep).\n\nLet's think about a trade where I give up items with a lower sum of values and receive items with a higher sum of values.\n\nMaybe: 2 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore\nValue given: (2 * 8) + (2 * 18) = 16 + 36 = 52\nValue received: 1 * 39 = 39\nThis is also losing value.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of items with a net positive gain for me?\nPlayer 0 seems interested in Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore or Brick efficiently.\n\nConsider trading: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick\nValue given: (3 * 18) + (1 * 5) = 54 + 5 = 59\nValue received: 1 * 25 = 25\nStill losing value.\n\nI can make a trade that benefits me by getting more valuable items.\n\nHow about 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat for 1 Wood, 1 Brick?\nValue given: (2 * 18) + (2 * 5) = 36 + 10 = 46\nValue received: (1 * 8) + (1 * 25) = 8 + 25 = 33\nStill a loss.\n\nI need to offer less value than I receive.\n\nWhat about offering items that I have in abundance for something that is more valuable?\nI have 20 Wheat and 16 Sheep.\n\nOffer: 6 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore\nValue given: (6 * 5) + (1 * 18) = 30 + 18 = 48\nValue received: 1 * 39 = 39\nStill a loss.\n\nLet's try to propose a trade that gives me a small positive gain while being potentially attractive to Player 0.\n\nPlayer 0 offered 5 Sheep for 3 Brick. This means Player 0 values Brick highly or wants my Sheep.\n\nI currently have 19 Brick. I don't want to give it up unless I'm getting something much better.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nOffer: 1 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore\nValue given: (1 * 8) + (3 * 18) = 8 + 54 = 62\nValue received: 1 * 39 = 39\nStill bad.\n\nI need to make a tempting offer for Player 0 that increases my value.\n\nConsider 1 Wood, 1 Ore -> 3 Brick\nValue given: (1 * 8) + (1 * 39) = 47\nValue received: (3 * 25) = 75\nThis is a good deal for me, but maybe too good for Player 0 to accept. I also don't want to give up Ore.\n\nLet's try to obtain Brick or Ore using Wheat and Sheep.\nMy lowest value resources are Wheat (5) and Wood (8). Sheep (18) is in the middle. Brick (25) and Ore (39) are high.\n\nWhat if I offer 15 Wheat and 5 Sheep for 3 Ore?\nValue given: (15 * 5) + (5 * 18) = 75 + 90 = 165\nValue received: 3 * 39 = 117\nBad trade.\n\nLet's try to make a profitable offer based on my current resources and desired resources.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Sheep. I want to convert them into Brick or Ore.\n\nHow about: 5 Wheat, 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick\nValue given: (5 * 5) + (5 * 18) = 25 + 90 = 115\nValue received: 2 * 25 = 50\nStill a loss.\n\nLet's aim for a small profit.\nI have plenty of Sheep, and Player 0 showed interest in them.\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick\nValue given: 2 * 18 = 36\nValue received: 1 * 25 = 25\nLoss of 11.\n\nOffer: 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wood\nValue given: 1 * 25 = 25\nValue received: (2 * 18) + (1 * 8) = 36 + 8 = 44\nThis is a gain for me, but it means giving up Brick. I want to GAIN Brick.\n\nThe previous accepted offers were good for me:\n5 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 2 Wood, 2 Brick (+3 value: (2 * 8 + 2 * 25) - (5 * 18 + 1 * 39) = (16+50) - (90+39) = 66 - 129 = -63. Wait. This was bad for me during the previous log. My calculation was wrong.) I think the previous accepted offer was in favour of the other player. Let's recheck if my log parsing was correct.\n\"Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 5 Sheep, 1 Ore -> Requested items: 2 Wood, 2 Brick\"\nValue offered by P1: (5 * 18) + (1 * 39) = 90 + 39 = 129\nValue requested by P1: (2 * 8) + (2 * 25) = 16 + 50 = 66\nSo, P1 offered 129 value and requested 66 value, which is a -63 value trade. This was a bad trade for me. I need to be more careful.\n\n\"Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Ore -> Requested items: 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep\"\nValue offered by P1: (1 * 8) + (1 * 25) + (1 * 39) = 8 + 25 + 39 = 72\nValue requested by P1: (1 * 5) + (1 * 18) = 5 + 18 = 23\nThis was also a horrible trade for me. Offered 72 value, requested 23 value.\n\nMy previous moves indicate I lost a lot of value. My goal is to *increase* my total value.\n\nMy strategy needs to change. I must ensure the value I REQUEST is higher than the value I OFFER.\n\nPlayer 0 just offered 5 Sheep (90) -> 3 Brick (75).\nI reject this.\n\nNow, I will make an offer that is strictly positive value for me.\n\nMy resources:\nWheat: 20 (5)\nWood: 8 (8)\nSheep: 16 (18)\nBrick: 19 (25)\nOre: 17 (39)\n\nI want more Ore and Brick. I have plenty of Wheat and Sheep.\n\nOffer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Brick\nValue offered: 10 * 5 = 50\nValue requested: 2 * 25 = 50\nThis is a neutral trade. I want a positive gain.\n\nLet's try to target Ore.\nOffer: 5 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore\nValue offered: (5 * 5) + (3 * 18) = 25 + 54 = 79\nValue requested: 1 * 39 = 39\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nThe last trade Player 0 proposed was 5 Sheep (90) for 3 Brick (75). Player 0 wants my Sheep.\n\nLet's offer a small amount of Sheep for more Brick. Or some Sheep and Wheat for a good Brick offer.\n\nOffer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood\nValue offered: 3 * 18 = 54\nValue requested: (1 * 25) + (1 * 8) = 33\nThis is a loss.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep for 1 Wood? (18 vs 8, loss)\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep for 1 Wheat? (18 vs 5, loss)\n\nI need to request higher-value items by offering lower-value items without losing value.\n\nTarget: 1 Ore (39 value)\nOffer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood\nValue offered: (2 * 18) + (1 * 8) = 36 + 8 = 44\nValue requested: 1 * 39 = 39\nStill a loss.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore for 2 Brick?\nValue offered: 1 * 39 = 39\nValue requested: 2 * 25 = 50\nThis is a gain for me of 11. I have 17 Ore, so I can afford to trade some. This seems like a good trade for me, and also for P0 if they value Brick over Ore.\n\nLet's counter Player 0's offer with a trade that benefits me.\nPlayer 0 offered: 5 Sheep (90) -> 3 Brick (75) - Bad for me.\n\nMy offer: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]\nThis increases my total value by 11.\nI will definitely reject Player 0's offer.\n\nOther good trades for me (request value > offer value):\nOffer 1 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Sheep\nValue offered: 8 + 5 = 13\nValue requested: 18\nGain: 5. This is good but gets me Sheep which I have a lot of.\n\nLet's stick to getting Brick or Ore.\n\nHow about:\nOffer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood\nValue offered: 39\nValue requested: 25 + 8 = 33\nThis is a loss for me. So, no.\n\nHow about:\nOffer: 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep\nValue offered: 39\nValue requested: 2 * 18 = 36\nThis is a loss for me. So, no.\n\nThe offer [Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick] has a positive value gain for me (+11).\nMy current resources: 20 Wheat, 8 Wood, 16 Sheep, 19 Brick, 17 Ore.\nAfter this trade: 20 Wheat, 8 Wood, 16 Sheep, 21 Brick, 16 Ore.\nValue: (20 * 5) + (8 * 8) + (16 * 18) + (21 * 25) + (16 * 39) = 100 + 64 + 288 + 525 + 624 = 1601.\nCurrent value was 1590. So 1601 - 1590 = +11. This is good.\n\nI will decline Player 0's offer and make my own profitable offer.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]",
