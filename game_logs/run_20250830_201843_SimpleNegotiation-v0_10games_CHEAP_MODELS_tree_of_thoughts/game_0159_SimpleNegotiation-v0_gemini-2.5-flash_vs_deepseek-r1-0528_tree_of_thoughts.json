I could try to trade some of those for higher value resources like Ore or Brick.\n\nMy current total value is (22*5) + (5*10) + (25*17) + (8*25) + (8*35) = 110 + 50 + 425 + 200 + 280 = 1065.\n\nLet's try to trade some sheep and wheat for brick or ore.\nIf I offer 5 Wheat (Value 25) and 5 Sheep (Value 85) for 2 Brick (Value 50), I lose value.\nIf I offer 5 Wheat (Value 25) and 5 Sheep (Value 85) for 3 Brick (Value 75), I still lose value.\n\nWhat about trading some Sheep for Ore?\n5 Sheep (Value 85) for 2 Ore (Value 70) - Not good.\n\nLet's try trading for Wood and Brick.\nI have plenty of Sheep, they are worth 17 each.

I need to be careful with the values.\n\nI need to make an offer that gives me more value than I give away.\nLet's look at the ratios.\n1 Brick (25) is worth 1.47 Sheep (17).\n1 Ore (35) is worth 2.06 Sheep (17).\n1 Ore (35) is worth 1.4 Brick (25).\n\nLet's say I want more Ore.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nMy value: 2 * 25 = 50.

Maybe I can make a slightly less greedy offer.\n\nLet's try to trade some Sheep for Brick.\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nMy value: 2 * 17 = 34. Requested value: 1 * 25 = 25. Still bad for me. I always have to offer less value than I get.\n\nIt's difficult because the values are not linearly related.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of low and high value resources to sweeten the deal for the opponent, while still making a profit myself?\n\nLet's try to get more Ore. Ore is the highest value resource.\nI have 8 Ore currently.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nMy value: (2 * 5) + (3 * 17) = 10 + 51 = 61. Requested value: 1 * 35 = 35.

What resources currently have low utility for me?\nWheat (5), Sheep (17).\nWhat resources currently have high utility for me?\nOre (35), Brick (25).\n\nLet's make an offer where I give resources with less value and get resources with higher value.\nI have 22 Wheat. Let's try to offload some of that.\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]\nMy value: (6 * 5) + (1 * 10) = 30 + 10 = 40. Requested value: 1 * 25 = 25. Still bad.\n\nI need to consider what the opponent might have and want.\nI need to make an offer where the value I *receive* is greater than the value I *give away*.\n\nLet's try to trade some quantity of lower value resources for fewer units of higher value resources.\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nMy value: 5 * 17 = 85. Requested value: 1 * 35 = 35. Still bad.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore (35) to get something like 2 Brick (50).\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]\nMy value: 1 * 35 = 35. Requested value: 2 * 25 = 50.
