This means accepting the offer would decrease the total value of your resources.\n\nLet's examine your current resources and their total value:\n- Wheat: 17 * 5 = 85\n- Wood: 14 * 11 = 154\n- Sheep: 9 * 16 = 144\n- Brick: 20 * 22 = 440\n- Ore: 10 * 33 = 330\n- Total value = 85 + 154 + 144 + 440 + 330 = 1153\n\nIf you accept the offer:\n- You lose 5 Brick and 3 Sheep: - (5 * 22 + 3 * 16) = - (110 + 48) = -158\n- You gain 5 Wood and 5 Wheat: + (5 * 11 + 5 * 5) = + (55 + 25) = +80\n- Net change = -158 + 80 = -78\n- New total value = 1153 - 78 = 1075\n\nSince accepting the offer would decrease your total resource value from 1153 to 1075, it's not beneficial.\n\nTherefore, my response to Player 0's offer is: `[Deny]`.",

Let's analyze the offers made so far and think about the next step.\n\n1. **Value Analysis of Previous Offers**:\n   - The initial offer and counteroffer involved giving away 5 Wood (Value: 55) and 5 Wheat (Value: 25), totaling 80, for 5 Brick (Value: 110) and 3 Sheep (Value: 48), totaling 158. This is a gain of 78 in total value.\n   - The second offer involved giving away 4 Wheat (Value: 20) and 2 Wood (Value: 22), totaling 42, for 3 Sheep (Value: 48). This is a gain of 6 in total value.\n\n2. **Potential Trades**:\n   - We need to think about what we have and what we can offer that would be beneficial. We have a surplus of Brick and a decent amount of Wheat and Wood.\n\n3. **New Offer**:\n   - Let's consider making an offer that could be more appealing. We can offer some Brick (which we have in surplus) in exchange for Ore or Sheep (which are of higher value).\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nLet's make a new offer: \n- Offered items: 4 Brick -> Requested items: 2 Sheep\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n- Giving away 4 Brick (Value: 88) for 2 Sheep (Value: 32). This results in a loss, so it's not a good trade.\n- Let's adjust our strategy.\n\nAlternative Offer:\n- Offered items: 3 Brick, 1 Wheat -> Requested items: 2 Sheep\n\nCalculation:\n- Giving away 3 Brick (Value: 66) and 1 Wheat (Value: 5), totaling 71, for 2 Sheep (Value: 32). This is still not beneficial.\n\nLet's think about another combination.\n\n### New Offer\n\nLet's try:\n- **[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]**\n\nCalculation:\n- Giving away 3 Brick (Value: 66) for 1 Ore (Value: 33). This is not beneficial as it results in a net loss of value.\n\nLet's think again.\n\n### Another Offer\n\nLet's consider:\n- **[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep]**\n\nCalculation:\n- Giving away 2 Wheat (Value: 10) and 1 Wood (Value: 11), totaling 21, for 1 Sheep (Value: 16). This results in a loss of 5.\n\nLet's directly decide on an action.\n\n### Action\n\nLet's directly propose an offer that seems reasonable.\n\n**[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]**\n\nThis involves giving away 3 Brick (Value: 66) for 2 Ore (Value: 66). It's a fair trade in terms of value.\n\nLet's send this offer.\n\n**[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]**",
