      "response": "I currently have:\n- Wheat: 24 \u2013 Unit Value 5  \u279c Total Wheat Value = 120  \n- Wood:  8 \u2013 Unit Value 12 \u279c Total Wood Value = 96  \n- Sheep: 17 \u2013 Unit Value 18 \u279c Total Sheep Value = 306  \n- Brick: 15 \u2013 Unit Value 28 \u279c Total Brick Value = 420  \n- Ore:   12 \u2013 Unit Value 37 \u279c Total Ore Value = 444  \n\nOverall portfolio value = 1 386  \n\nCurrent inventory after the earlier 3 Ore \u2192 2 Brick deal is now **Brick 15, Ore 12** and the counts above.\n\nObservation: Brick (28 per unit) and Ore (37 per unit) are my two highest-value resources. Since accumulating more Ore increases the value most quickly, I want to swap low-efficiency Wheat (5) and/or Wood (12) for Ore or sometimes Brick.\n\nThe last offers I made were all declined; they were either over-priced or unbalanced. I need to send something that looks attractive but still improves my value.\n\nI value the trade at my own unit prices. Offering:\n\nEXPR: 10 Wheat (10\u00d75 = 50) + 2 Wood (2\u00d712 = 24) = total offer value 74  \nWANT: 2 Ore (2\u00d737 = 74) + 0 Wheat/Brick  \n\nThis is value-neutral for me but might look generous because Wood is usually desirable to others; to Player 1 wheat is presumably cheaper. It also keeps the request moderate (2 Ore), improving acceptance odds.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
