      "response": "My Goal: Increase the total value of my resources.\nMy Resources:\n* Wheat: 23 @ 5 = 115\n* Wood: 19 @ 8 = 152\n* Sheep: 7 @ 16 = 112\n* Brick: 12 @ 22 = 264\n* Ore: 11 @ 40 = 440\nTotal Value: 115 + 152 + 112 + 264 + 440 = 1083\n\nI have a decent amount of low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) and a good amount of high-value resources (Ore, Brick). Sheep is in the middle.\n\nStrategy: I want to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or trade resources I have in abundance for resources I have less of, especially if the value exchange is good.\n\nI will start by offering resources I have a lot of (Wheat, Wood) for higher value resources like Ore or Brick, or even Sheep if the exchange is favorable.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore or Brick. I have a lot of Wheat and Wood.\nWhat if I offer a good chunk of Wheat and Wood for a smaller amount of Ore or Brick?\n\nOffer 1: Try to get Ore.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (10 * 5) + (5 * 8) = 50 + 40 = 90\nValue requested: 1 * 40 = 40\nThis is a bad offer for me, I'm giving up too much for too little. I need to flip it.\n\nI want to *receive* higher value items.\n\nLet's try to offer a higher value resource that I have in abundance for other resources.\nI have 11 Ore and 12 Brick. These are my most valuable.\nMaybe I can trade my excess Wheat/Wood/Sheep for Brick/Ore.\n\nHow about I offer a large quantity of low-value resources for a small quantity of high-value resources?\nFor example, a lot of Wheat for some Brick or Ore.\n\nInitial thought: Trade my 23 Wheat (value 5) for something more valuable.\n\nLet's try offering my Wood as I have 19 of it and its value is 8.\nI could offer a large amount of Wood for a single unit of Ore.\nValue of 1 Ore = 40.\nValue of 5 Wood = 5 * 8 = 40. This would be a fair 1-for-1 value trade, but players usually want value advantage.\nSo I should offer a bit more than 40 value in Wood to get 1 Ore.\n\nLet's also consider Sheep. I have 7 Sheep (value 16).\nValue of 1 Brick = 22.\n\nTurn 1 Strategy: Offer abundant low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for higher-value resources (Brick, Ore, even Sheep).\n\nLet's make an offer that is slightly favorable to me but still appealing for the opponent.\n\nMy current total value: 1083.\n\nOffer 1: Try to trade Wood for Ore.\nOffer: 6 Wood (Value 48) for 1 Ore (Value 40). This is good for me. Slightly unfavorable for the opponent, maybe they accept if they need Wood.\n\nLet's try to be a bit more generous to ensure acceptance, but still gain value.\n\nIf I offer 7 Wood (value 56) for 1 Ore (value 40), that's not good for me.\n\nI need to offer a small amount of high-value goods for a large amount of low-value goods if I have many high-value goods. Not in my interest now.\n\nI need to get rid of low-value goods.\n\nLet's target Brick. I have 12 Brick.\nWhat if I offer: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick]\nValue of 5 Wheat = 5 * 5 = 25\nValue of 3 Wood = 3 * 8 = 24\nTotal offered value = 25 + 24 = 49\nValue of 1 Brick = 22\nThis is a terrible offer for me, I am giving up 49 value for 22.\n\nI need to reverse this. What do I want? More valuable resources.\nWhat do I have a lot of? Wheat, Wood.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nI have 11 Ore.\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore (value 40) for a significant amount of Wheat and Wood? This increases my 'quantity' but not necessarily 'value'.\nThis is a bad idea because Ore is my most valuable resource.\n\nFocus: Get more Brick/Ore by giving up Wheat/Wood/Sheep.\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep (Value 32) -> 1 Brick (Value 22), 1 Wheat (Value 5). Total 27. (Bad for me)\n\nLet's offer a lot of Wheat and some Wood for a single Brick.\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]\nValue of 8 Wheat = 8 * 5 = 40\nValue of 2 Wood = 2 * 8 = 16\nTotal Offered: 56\nValue of 1 Brick: 22\nStill bad for me. It's too costly to convert low-value resources to high-value resources.\n\nLet's rethink. I have a lot of Wheat (23 @ 5) and Wood (19 @ 8).\nWhat if I try to trade my lowest value for intermediate value?\n23 Wheat, 19 Wood.\nI could trade Wheat for Wood, or Wheat for Sheep.\n\nLet's try to trade a significant amount of Wheat for a single Sheep.\nValue of 1 Sheep = 16.\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (Value 15) for 1 Sheep (Value 16). This sounds reasonable for both sides.\nThe opponent gains 1 value (16-15), and I am converting a low-value resource (Wheat) into a higher-value resource (Sheep) at a good exchange rate. I would reduce my Wheat count but gain a more valuable Sheep.\n\nLet's make this my first offer. It's a small gain, but a gain nonetheless, and it tests the waters.\nI have 23 Wheat, so I can afford to give 3.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]",

Since that was rejected, Player 1 seems to want more advantage from the trade.\n\nLet's try to make an offer that is slightly more favorable to Player 1, but still good for me.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Wood. Ore is high value.\nWhat if I try to get some Ore or Brick for my Wheat and Wood?\n\nConsider: Offer: 18 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 1 Ore.\nMy offer: 18 Wheat (18*5 = 90) + 10 Wood (10*8 = 80) = 170\nRequest: 1 Ore (40)\nThis is still not good for me. I need to be gaining value.\n\nLet's try to shed some low-value resources for high-value resources.\nI have 23 Wheat (value 5).\nI have 19 Wood (value 8).\n\nHow about trading a lot of low-value items for a single medium-high value item?\nOffer: 15 Wheat, 7 Wood -> 1 Brick.\nMy offer: 15 Wheat (15*5 = 75) + 7 Wood (7*8 = 56) = 131\nRequest: 1 Brick (22)\nThis is a terrible offer for them, and good for me. They will deny.\n\nI need to make an offer that is beneficial for me, but seems reasonable to Player 1.\nPlayer 1 offered 1 Ore for 10 Wheat and 5 Wood. This implies Player 1 values Wheat and Wood highly, or Ore less, or both.\nMy desired outcome is to increase my total resource value.\nPerhaps I should try to acquire more high-value resources like Ore or Brick, by giving up a combination of my abundant lower-value resources.\n\nLet's rethink my previous offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Ore.\nMy offer valuation: 10*5 + 5*8 = 50 + 40 = 90.\nMy request valuation: 1*40 = 40.\nThis was very beneficial to me, hence denied.\n\nPlayer 1's offer: 1 Ore -> 10 Wheat, 5 Wood.\nPlayer 1's offer valuation: 1*40 = 40.\nPlayer 1's request valuation: 10*5 + 5*8 = 50 + 40 = 90.\nThis is very beneficial to Player 1, which is why it was offered.\n\nThe previous exchanges indicate that Player 1 values Wheat and Wood more than I do (relative to Ore). Or they just want to make profit.\nI need to find a middle ground where I still profit.\n\nLet's try to give less Wheat and Wood for Ore.\nOr give a fair amount of Wheat/Wood for Brick.\n\nHow about 5 Wheat, 5 Wood for 1 Brick?\nOffer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Brick\nMy offer: 5*5 + 5*8 = 25 + 40 = 65\nRequest: 1*22 = 22\nStill too much for them.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again, but not give up too much.\nWhat about offering some Wood for some Ore?\nIf 10 Wheat, 5 Wood was too much for 1 Ore, what if I offer something slightly less, but still good for me?\nLet's try selling a lot of low value items for one higher value item.\n\nOffer: 10 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick\nMy offer value: 10*5 + 3*8 = 50 + 24 = 74\nRequested value: 1*22 = 22\nThis is a gain of 52 for me. Likely, they will deny this too.\n\nLet's accept an offer that gains me value, or make one that gains me value.\nThe current offer from Player 1 is a loss for me. So, [Deny].\nThen I need to make a new offer that aims to gain value.\n\nLet's try to make a profitable offer for Player 0, that also gives Player 1 some benefit (or at least looks like it).\nI have 23 Wheat and 19 Wood. I can definitely shed some.\nI have 7 Sheep and 12 Brick and 11 Ore. I don't want to get rid of too much of these unless it's a super good deal.\n\nMaybe I can offer a combination of Wheat and Wood for some higher value resources.\nLet's try to target Brick, as it is lower value than Ore, so Player 1 might be more willing to part with it.\nWhat if I offer 15 Wheat for 1 Brick?\nMy offer: 15 Wheat (15*5=75)\nRequest: 1 Brick (1*22=22)\nThis is a huge gain for me. Very unlikely they accept.\n\nWhat about 5 Wheat, 2 Wood for 1 Sheep?\nMy offer: 5*5 + 2*8 = 25 + 16 = 41\nRequest: 1*16 = 16\nStill a gain of 25 for me here.\n\nLet's try to bridge the gap from my initial rejected offer of 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Ore.\nMy side: 90. Their side: 40.\nPlayer 1's counter: 1 Ore -> 10 Wheat, 5 Wood.\nMy side: 40. Their side: 90.\nThey want 50 profit, I want 50 profit.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore -> 12 Wheat?\nMy offer: 1 Ore (40)\nPlayer 1 gains 12 Wheat (12*5 = 60). Player 1 gains 20 value. I lose 20 value. This is worse for me than Player 1's offer.\n\nOk, let's keep Player 0's objective in mind: total value of resources increases.\nI will deny Player 1's offer. Then I will make my own offer.\nMy offer needs to gain me value.\n\nIf 10 Wheat, 5 Wood (value 90) for 1 Ore (value 40) was denied, I need to reduce what I ask for, or increase what I give.\nWhat if I offer 12 Wheat, 6 Wood for 1 Ore?\nMy offer: 12*5 + 6*8 = 60 + 48 = 108\nRequest: 1*40 = 40\nThis would be a loss of 68 for me. No.\n\nI need to gain value. Not lose it.\nLet's reconsider Player 1's last offer carefully:\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 10 Wheat, 5 Wood]\nValue offered by P1: 1 Ore * 40 = 40\nValue requested by P1: (10 Wheat * 5) + (5 Wood * 8) = 50 + 40 = 90\nIf I accept, I give 90 value and get 40 value. Net loss of 50. I must Deny.\n\nSo, I need to make an offer that gives me positive value.\nI have plenty of Wheat and Wood. Ore is most valuable. Brick is second.\nLet's try to get Ore again, but not for too many low-value items.\n\nHow about trying to get 1 Ore for just a few resources, even if it looks like a negative trade for them at first glance.\nWhat about 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep. (This was just an example from the prompt, don't use this one).\n\nLet's try to offer 10 Wheat, 2 Wood for 1 Ore.\nMy offer: 10 Wheat (50) + 2 Wood (16) = 66\nRequest: 1 Ore (40)\nThis still results in a 26 value loss for me. So this is not good.\n\nIt seems I was approaching this by thinking Player 1 is being greedy. I need to be greedy as well.\nMy initial offer of 10 Wheat, 5 Wood (90) for 1 Ore (40) was a gain of 50 for me. This was denied.\n\nI want to shed Wheat and Wood.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wheat and Wood for a smaller quantity of a higher value item, BUT, the value is not too skewed in my favor.\nI have a significant amount of Wheat and Wood.\nInstead of aiming for 1 Ore, let's aim for 1 Brick.\n\nConsider: Offer 8 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Brick.\nMy offer value: (8 * 5) + (5 * 8) = 40 + 40 = 80\nRequested value: 1 Brick * 22 = 22\nThis would be a gain of 58 for me. This is likely to be denied.\n\nLet's try to balance it a bit.\nWhat if I offer almost double the value of what I want?\nOffer: 5 Wood -> 1 Ore\nValue offered: 5 * 8 = 40\nValue requested: 1 * 40 = 40\nThis is a 0 sum trade. It could be accepted. If accepted, it moves some of my abundant Wood to the higher value Ore.\nThis benefits me because it converts a less valuable resource into a more valuable resource *per unit*, even if the total value is equal.\nSo I will still accept this if it increases my concentration of high value resources.\n\nI have 19 Wood. I can part with 5 Wood.\nI have 11 Ore. Adding 1 Ore is good.\n\nLet's propose a trade that gives Player 1 some benefit as well.\nMaybe I should try to get two different high-value resources.\n\nHow about: 15 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep\nMy offer: 15*5 + 5*8 = 75 + 40 = 115\nRequested: 1*22 + 1*16 = 38\nThis is a huge gain for me.\n\nMy goal is to increase the value of my resources.\nLet's make a small profitable offer.\nWheat is the lowest value resource.\nOffer: 15 Wheat -> 1 Sheep\nMy offer: 15*5 = 75\nRequest: 1*16 = 16\nThis is too skewed.\n\nLet's try: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick.\nMy offer: 3*8 = 24\nRequest: 1*22 = 22\nThis is a gain of 2 for me, and only a loss of 2 for them. This might be accepted!\nI have 19 Wood, so I can spare 3. I have 12 Brick, so adding 1 is good.\nThis seems like a reasonable offer to test the waters and get a quick small gain.\n\nFirst, I must deny Player 1's current offer, as it's a loss for me.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"Deny\"\n}\n```\nThen I make my offer:\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
