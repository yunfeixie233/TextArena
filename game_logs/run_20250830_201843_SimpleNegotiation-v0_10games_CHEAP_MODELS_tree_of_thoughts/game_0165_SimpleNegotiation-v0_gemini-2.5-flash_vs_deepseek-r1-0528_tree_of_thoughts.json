I need to be more careful to make trades that increase my total value.\n\nGoal: Increase total value.\nAvailable resources:\nWheat: 22 (Value: 6)\nWood: 22 (Value: 10)\nSheep: 11 (Value: 18)\nBrick: 17 (Value: 25)\nOre: 5 (Value: 33)\n\nI have a decent amount of Brick, which has a higher value. I also have a good amount of Wheat and Wood, but their individual values are lower. Ore has the highest value, but I only have 5. Sheep is mid-range.\n\nLet's look for opportunities to trade lower-value items for higher-value items.\nFor example, trading Wheat (6) or Wood (10) for Brick (25) or Ore (33).\n\nConsider offering a combination of Wheat and/or Wood for a higher value item.\nOr, I could try to trade some of my excess Brick for something I have less of, like Ore, if the exchange is favorable.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, as it's the highest value and I have few.\nIf I offer Brick for Ore: 1 Brick (25) for 1 Ore (33) -> +8 value. This is a good trade.\nPlayer 1 might not want to do 1 for 1 for their higher-value item.\n\nWhat about trading lower value items for higher value?\nFor example, Wheat (6) and Wood (10) for Brick (25).\nIf I offer 2 Wheat (12 total) and 1 Wood (10 total) for 1 Brick (25).\nMy side: 12 + 10 = 22. Opponent side: 25. This is a gain of 3.\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n\nAlternatively, let's look at what Player 1 might need or want based on the previous trade (they traded away 1 Brick). They might still have a surplus of Brick or might be looking for something else. I can't know for sure, so I'll make an offer that benefits me.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore.\nAssume Player 1 has some Ore and wants something of moderate value that I have in good quantity.\nI have 17 Brick. Brick is valuable.\n\nLet's offer a combination of lower value items for a higher value item.\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick] Value offered: 3*10 = 30. Value requested: 25. This is a loss for me. No.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore] Value offered: 2*18 = 36. Value requested: 33. This is also a loss for me. No.\n\nI need to make sure my requested value is greater than my offered value.\n\nLet's try trading lower value resources in bulk for one of my higher value resources.\nLet's offer Wheat and Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat] Offered: 40. Requested: 25+6=31. Loss.\n\nHow about trading for Ore?\nIf I offer Brick for Ore, 1 Brick (25) for 1 Ore (33). This is +8 for me. Worth trying.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nI could also trade some Sheep for Brick if I can get a good deal.\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick] Offered: 36. Requested: 50. This is a good deal for me (+14), but might be too steep for Player 1.\nHow about a 1:1 trade of Sheep for Brick?\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick] Offered: 18. Requested: 25. This is a gain of 7 for me. This is a more reasonable offer that still benefits me. I have 11 Sheep and 17 Brick, so I could stand to reduce my Sheep count and gain Brick.\n\nLet's propose a trade that gives me a good value increase, but is still somewhat balanced with the opponent.\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick] This gains me 7 value per trade.\n\nAnother option: trade Wood (10) for Wheat (6) but that would be going backwards.\n\nHow about getting rid of Wheat for something better?\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Wood] Offered: 18. Requested: 10. Loss.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick to get more Ore?\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore] Offered: 25. Requested: 33. This is +8 for me. This seems like a reasonable offer. I have 17 Brick, so I can spare one if I get a higher value item. Player 1 might accept this if they need Brick.\n\nLet's go with an offer that favors me significantly, like converting a mid-value item for a high-value item for a good gain.\nI want Ore. I have some Brick.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nMy current value is 1140.\nIf successful: (22*6) + (22*10) + (11*18) + (16*25) + (6*33) = 132 + 220 + 198 + 400 + 198 = 1148.
