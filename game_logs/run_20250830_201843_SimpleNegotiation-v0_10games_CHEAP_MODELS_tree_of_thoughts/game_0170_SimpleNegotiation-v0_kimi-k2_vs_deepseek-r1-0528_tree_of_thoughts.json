      "response": "Let me quickly re-sum my totals after the earlier accepted trade.\n\nImmediate previous accepted trade (during the game):  \nI gave 4 Brick (value 4 \u00d7 1.5 \u2248 6) and received 6 Wheat (6 \u00d7 0.46 \u2248 2.74) + 6 Wood (6 \u00d7 0.57 \u2248 3.43). Net value gained \u2248 0.17, essentially neutral. It did push my brick count down and wheat/wood up, which is now making Player 1 repeat the same deal every turn.\n\nLooking purely at value, Brick is currently my single highest-value unit. I do have 18 left, so I can afford to lose 4 more without crippling my flexibility. Repeating the exact offer (4 Brick \u2192 6 Wheat + 6 Wood) is again slightly unfavourable on paper, but it also increases my Wheat/Wood stacks which may be necessary in later proposals with more favourable odds.\n\nSince the pattern shows Player 1 will ONLY offer this \u201c6-6-4\u201d variant each turn, if I\u2019m mostly indifferent or want to push my Wheat/Wood count upward, I can accept again.\n\nTherefore:\n\n[Accept]",
