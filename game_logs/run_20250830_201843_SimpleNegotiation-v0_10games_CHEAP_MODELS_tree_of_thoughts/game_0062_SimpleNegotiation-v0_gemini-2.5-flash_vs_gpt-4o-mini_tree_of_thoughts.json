      "response": "Okay, I understand. I will act as Player 0, aiming to increase the total value of my resources through negotiation and strategic trades. I will carefully consider each offer and use the specified format for my actions.\n\nMy current total value is:\n(25 * 6) + (8 * 8) + (9 * 13) + (23 * 24) + (23 * 40)\n= 150 + 64 + 117 + 552 + 920\n= 1803\n\nLet's begin! I need to make the first offer.\n\nMy goal is to increase my value. I have a lot of Brick and Ore. Wheat is my lowest value item. Sheep is also relatively low.\n\nI will try to trade away some Wheat for something higher value, or trade a resource I have in abundance for something I need.\n\nLet's try to get more Wood, Sheep, or even Ore.\n\n**Turn 1: As Player 0, I will make an initial offer.**\n\nI have a lot of Brick and Ore, which are high value. Wheat is low value and plentiful. I want to increase overall value.\n\nLet's try to trade Brick for something else high-value or diversify. Or get rid of Wheat.\n\nHow about trading some Wheat for Sheep or Wood?\nOr maybe some excess Brick for Ore if Player 1 has some.\n\nLet's make an offer that tries to get rid of some low-value Wheat and gain some higher-value Sheep or Wood.\n\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Sheep]`\n(10 * 6 = 60 value offered) for (3 * 13 = 39 value requested). This is a bad offer for me. I need to get more value than I give.\n\nOkay, let's rethink. I want to **gain value**.\n\nOption 1: Trade low-value for high-value.\nOption 2: Trade excess high-value for *even more* high-value, or something I need.\n\nI have 25 Wheat (value 6).\nI have 23 Brick (value 24).\nI have 23 Ore (value 40).\n\nLet me try to trade some Wheat for something I need, or something that is more valuable than Wheat.\n\nHow about trading some of my plentiful (and relatively low-value) Wheat for some Wood? Wood is Value 8.\nOr Sheep, Value 13.\n\nLet's try to make an offer where I give up a decent amount of Wheat to get some higher-value items.\nI have 25 Wheat.\n\n`[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 3 Sheep, 1 Wood]`\nValue offered: 15 * 6 = 90\nValue requested: (3 * 13) + (1 * 8) = 39 + 8 = 47. Still bad for me. I need to be asking for more value.\n\nOkay, let's try to get rid of Brick or Ore if I can get a better deal for them.\nI have a lot of Brick (23) and Ore (23). They are high value.\n\nWhat if I offer one of my abundant high-value resources for something very valuable, or a good quantity?\n\nLet's try to get some Ore or Brick back, because they are high value. Or Sheep.\n\n`[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore]`\nValue offered: 5 * 24 = 120\nValue requested: 2 * 40 = 80. Still bad for me.\n\nMy goal is to increase my total value. So **Value Offered < Value Requested**.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 is also trying to maximize their value. They will only accept if Value Offered > Value Requested for *them*.\n\nI have a lot of Brick (23 @ 24) and Ore (23 @ 40). These are high value.\nI have 25 Wheat @ 6.\n\nLet's try an offer where I give a smaller quantity of high-value for a larger quantity of medium/high value. Or give a lower value resource for higher value.\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\n1. Try to offload Wheat for higher value resources like Sheep, Wood, Brick, or Ore.\n2. If I have excess of a high-value resource, try to trade it for a different high-value resource where I can get a good deal (e.g., 1 Ore for 2 Brick, if Player 1 values Brick less).\n\nLet's try for a mutually beneficial offer, but slightly favoring me as Player 0.\n\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wood]`\nValue offered: 10 * 6 = 60\nValue requested: (2 * 13) + (1 * 8) = 26 + 8 = 34. This is a very bad trade for me. I'm giving up more than I'm getting.\n\nOkay, I'm getting confused on which direction the value flows.\n**I want to receive more total value than I give away.**\n\nExample: If I offer 10 Wheat (Value 60), I want to receive something with *more than* 60 value.\nSo, if I offered 10 Wheat (60 value), I might request 2 Brick (48 value) or 2 Ore (80 value).\nIf I request 2 Ore, that's good for me.\n\nLet's try to trade some Wheat for Ore. Ore is my highest value.\n\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Ore]`\nValue offered: 10 * 6 = 60\nValue requested: 3 * 40 = 120\nThis is a very good deal for me! Player 1 might deny this.\n\nI need to make an offer that *could* be accepted by Player 1, so it needs to be somewhat balanced or good for them too. Player 1 likely also wants to increase their value.\n\nLet's try to trade some of my excess high-value resource (Ore or Brick) for another high-value resource, aiming for a small gain.\nI have **23 Ore** (Value 40) and **23 Brick** (Value 24).\n\nHow about trading some Brick for Ore? Ore is higher value.\n\n`[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]`\nValue Offered: 3 * 24 = 72\nValue Requested: 1 * 40 = 40\nThis is bad for me. I'm giving more value than I'm getting. I need to flip this.\n\n**Revised thought process:** I want `Value (Requested Resources) > Value (Offered Resources)`.\n\nLet's offer a high-value resource for a very slightly higher value of the *same* resource, or another resource that is good for me.\n\nI have 23 Ore and 23 Brick. I have a lot of these. Maybe player 1 needs them.\n\nLet's try to trade a slightly lower value resource for a higher value resource.\nI have a relatively low quantity of Wood (8) and Sheep (9).\n\nLet me try to trade Wheat for Sheep or Wood.\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Sheep, 1 Wood]`\nValue Offered: 10 * 6 = 60\nValue Requested: (1 * 13) + (1 * 8) = 13 + 8 = 21. This is still bad. My previous calculations of this were all wrong.\n\n**This is the core rule:** My goal is to make the value of what I RECEIVE higher than the value of what I GIVE.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 is greedy too. They want what they receive to be higher than what they give.\nThis means for a trade to happen, one player needs to take a loss, or both gain through diversification/utility if values are subjective. Here, values are objective.\n\nThis means a direct value-increasing trade might be hard to get accepted.\n\nOkay, I will try to make a slightly unbalanced offer in my favour for my first move.\nI have a lot of Wheat. It's my lowest-value item.\nI want to get rid of Wheat and get high-value items.\n\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\nValue offered: 10 * 6 = 60\nValue requested: 1 * 24 = 24. This is a very bad deal for me. I keep doing this wrong.\n\nLet me try to trade Brick for Ore, as Ore is my highest value.\nI have 23 Brick (24 value) and 23 Ore (40 value).\n\n`[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]`\nValue offered: 2 * 24 = 48\nValue requested: 1 * 40 = 40. This is bad for me. I'm offering 48 value for 40 value.\n\nI want to **receive more value than I give.**\nSo, `Value (Requested) > Value (Offered)`\n\nLet's try this now:\n`[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]`\nValue Offered: 1 * 40 = 40\nValue Requested: 3 * 24 = 72\nThis is a good offer for me. I gain 32 value. Player 1 might accept if they need Ore more than Brick.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable first offer. I have 23 Ore, so I can afford to trade one if it means gaining value.\nI have 23 Brick, so receiving more Brick is also good.\n\nLet's go with this.\n\n`[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]`",
