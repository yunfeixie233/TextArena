      "response": "Given that my previous offer was rejected, I need to adjust my strategy. Player 1 might find the cost for Brick too high, or the Sheep not valuable enough. I have a lot of Brick and Sheep, so I can afford to be generous with them. Ore is quite valuable, so I should be careful not to give too much away.\n\nI will try offering more of my abundant resources (Sheep and Brick) for something I need more of, like Wheat or Wood, or even more Ore if the deal is good.\n\nLet's look at my current inventory and values:\n+ [Wheat]   Qty: 6    Value: 6\n+ [Wood]    Qty: 19   Value: 8\n+ [Sheep]   Qty: 25   Value: 13\n+ [Brick]   Qty: 23   Value: 21\n+ [Ore]     Qty: 8    Value: 33\n\nMy previous offer was: 3 Sheep (3*13=39) + 2 Ore (2*33=66) = 105 total value in resources offered.\nRequested: 5 Brick (5*21=105) + 2 Sheep (2*13=26) = 131 total value requested.\n\nThis means I was asking for 131 value for 105 value, which is not beneficial for me. My assumption was that Player 1 might value Brick more than me. This was a bad offer to me. I need to make sure I get more value than I give.\n\nLet me try to trade my abundant Sheep and Brick for something I need. Wheat (6 Qty) is relatively low. Wood (19 Qty) is second lowest after Wheat. Ore (8 Qty) is low too, but very valuable.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep and Brick, so I will try to offer them.\nLet's make an offer where I get more value than I give.\n\nI will offer some Sheep and Brick, and ask for Wheat or Wood.\nMy Goal: Increase total value. Get resources I have less of.\n\nLet's try to get Ore. Ore is highly valuable.\nIf I offer: 10 Sheep (10*13 = 130) + 5 Brick (5*21 = 105) = 235\nAnd request: 5 Ore (5*33 = 165) + 2 Wheat (2*6 = 12) = 177\nThis still doesn't look like a good trade for me. I am offering more than I get.\n\nI need to make sure the value of what I receive is *greater* than the value of what I offer.\n\nLet's focus on offloading Sheep and Brick.\nCurrent values:\nWheat: 6\nWood: 8\nSheep: 13\nBrick: 21\nOre: 33\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Sheep for something more valuable?\n[Offer: 10 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\n10 Sheep = 10 * 13 = 130\n3 Ore = 3 * 33 = 99\nThis is not good for me. I'm losing value.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore]\n5 Brick = 5 * 21 = 105\n2 Ore = 2 * 33 = 66\nAlso bad for me.\n\nI need to get *more* value than I give.\n\nLet's try to get Wood or Wheat for my excess Sheep/Brick.\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 3 Wood]\n5 Sheep = 5 * 13 = 65\n3 Wood = 3 * 8 = 24\nStill losing.\n\nOkay, let's reverse my thinking. I want to trade away things I have a lot of, for things that are more valuable or that I have less of.\n\nWhat if I offer a combination?\nLet's offer some Sheep and Brick.\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 2 Ore]\n5 Sheep = 5 * 13 = 65\n2 Brick = 2 * 21 = 42\nTotal Offered Value = 107\n2 Ore = 2 * 33 = 66\nStill bad. I am giving 107 value for 66 value.\n\nI must *receive* more value than I *give*.\n\nLet's try to offload some Brick, which is medium value but I have a lot of.\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore] no, this is bad for me.\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Wheat]\n3 Brick = 3 * 21 = 63\n1 Ore = 33\n1 Wheat = 6\nTotal Request Value = 39. Still bad for me.\n\nThe prompt states my previous offer was \"Offered resources: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> Requested resources: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\".\nWith my values:\nOffered: 3 Sheep (3*13=39) + 2 Ore (2*33=66) = 105\nRequested: 5 Brick (5*21=105) + 2 Sheep (2*13=26) = 131\nMy previous offer was actually *good* for me in terms of value (I gained 26 value). So Player 1 rejected an offer that was beneficial for me. This means Player 1 probably thought the offer was not good for *them*. Maybe they don't have enough Brick or don't need Sheep, or they value their Brick more heavily than my stated values.\n\nNew Strategy: Offer something where Player 1 might see a direct benefit, even if it's slightly less beneficial for me by value, but still net positive.\n\nConsider offering resources I have in large supply for something I have less of.\nI have a lot of Sheep (25) and Brick (23). Smallest is Wheat (6) and Ore (8).\n\nLet's try to get Ore, as it's the highest value.\nWhat if I offer a lot of Sheep and Brick for a small amount of Ore? And maybe some Wheat to sweeten the deal for Player 1.\n\n[Offer: 10 Sheep, 5 Brick -> 3 Ore, 3 Wheat]\nValue Offered:\n10 Sheep = 10 * 13 = 130\n5 Brick = 5 * 21 = 105\nTotal Offered Value = 235\n\nValue Requested:\n3 Ore = 3 * 33 = 99\n3 Wheat = 3 * 6 = 18\nTotal Requested Value = 117\n\nThis is still very bad for me (235 offered for 117 requested). I need to GET more than I GIVE.\n\nLet's make an offer where I get significantly more value.\nI have abundant Sheep and Brick. Ore is very valuable.\nHow about trading some Brick for Ore and Wheat?\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore] (My gain in value: 66 - 105 = -39. Bad for me).\n\nI need to make an offer that is beneficial for me, meaning `value(requested resources) > value(offered resources)`.\n\nLet's try:\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Wood, 1 Wheat]\nMy gain in value: 2 Wood (16) + 1 Wheat (6) = 22. Offered 5 Sheep (65). This is bad.\n\nLet's try to target Ore.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n3 Sheep = 3 * 13 = 39\n1 Ore = 33\nThis is bad for me because 33 < 39.\n\nOkay, I'm getting confused on calculating real profit.\nIf I offer X and request Y, I gain `Value(Y) - Value(X)`. I want `Value(Y) - Value(X) > 0`.\n\nLet's try to get Ore by offering Brick. I have 23 Brick and it's worth 21. Ore is 33.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n1 Brick (21) vs 1 Ore (33). I gain 12. This is an excellent trade for me. Player 1 will likely deny this.\n\nWhat if Player 1 also has a lot of Brick and values Ore more?\nI need to make an offer that is tempting for Player 1, potentially by offering a resource they might need or a lot of a resource I have in abundance for something that is valuable but I have less of.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, since it's the most valuable.\n[Offer: 5 Brick, 5 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\n5 Brick = 5 * 21 = 105\n5 Sheep = 5 * 13 = 65\nOffered Value = 170\n3 Ore = 3 * 33 = 99\nRequested Value = 99\nNet Change = 99 - 170 = -71. This is very bad for me. I constantly make offers that lose me value.\n\nI must be misinterpreting the problem or my goal.\nMy goal is to increase the *total value* of *my* resources.\nSo if I trade X for Y, I want `Value(Y) > Value(X)`.\n\nLet's use my previous accepted offer logic:\nPlayer 0 offered: 3 Sheep (13*3=39) + 2 Ore (33*2=66) = 105\nPlayer 0 requested: 5 Brick (21*5=105) + 2 Sheep (13*2=26) = 131\nPlayer 0 total gain: 131 - 105 = 26. This was a good offer for me.\n\nPlayer 1 rejected. Why? Maybe Player 1 values Brick very highly, or doesn't need Sheep, or doesn't have Ore.\n\nLet's try to offer something Player 1 might see as useful.\nI have a LOT of Sheep and Brick.\nLet's offer some of my abundant resources for some of Player 1's potentially abundant or less valued resources.\n\nCurrent inventory:\n+ [Wheat]   Qty: 6    Value: 6\n+ [Wood]    Qty: 19   Value: 8\n+ [Sheep]   Qty: 25   Value: 13\n+ [Brick]   Qty: 23   Value: 21\n+ [Ore]     Qty: 8    Value: 33\n\nI want to increase my *total value*.\nSo I want to trade low value items for high value items. Or many items for fewer high-value items.\n\nHow about trading a lot of Sheep and Brick for some Ore?\n[Offer: 15 Sheep, 10 Brick -> 8 Ore]\n15 Sheep = 15 * 13 = 195\n10 Brick = 10 * 21 = 210\nTotal Offered Value = 405\n\n8 Ore = 8 * 33 = 264\nTotal Requested Value = 264\nNet Gain = 264 - 405 = -141. Still losing value.\n\nOkay, let me reset. I need to make an offer where I get a net positive value.\nWhat if I try to get something I have very few of, like Wheat?\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 8 Wheat]\n5 Brick = 5 * 21 = 105\n8 Wheat = 8 * 6 = 48\nNet Gain = 48 - 105 = -57. Still bad.\n\nI need to decrease the amount I offer or increase the amount I request.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore for fewer valuable resources.\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Wheat]\n3 Brick = 3 * 21 = 63\n1 Ore = 33\n1 Wheat = 6\nRequested Value = 39\nNet Gain = 39 - 63 = -24. Bad.\n\nWhat if I assume Player 1 is low on Wood or Wheat from the last turn (since they didn't offer anything)?\nI have a decent amount of Wood. I have low Wheat.\n\nLet's try to trade some Sheep and Brick, for Wheat and Wood.\n[Offer: 8 Sheep, 5 Brick -> 15 Wood, 5 Wheat]\n8 Sheep = 8 * 13 = 104\n5 Brick = 5 * 21 = 105\nTotal Offered = 209\n\n15 Wood = 15 * 8 = 120\n5 Wheat = 5 * 6 = 30\nTotal Requested = 150\nNet Gain = 150 - 209 = -59. Still not beneficial for me.\n\nThe last offer from Player 0 (me) was: [Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]. This offer had a positive value for Player 0 (26). It was rejected.\n\nLet's try to offer a smaller amount of my highly valued Ore, combined with a lot of my low value Sheep/Brick, to get a lot of something Player 1 might value less or have in abundance.\nBut I want to gain overall value.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore and 5 Sheep, and ask for a large amount of Brick and Wood?\n[Offer: 1 Ore, 5 Sheep -> 10 Brick, 5 Wood]\n1 Ore = 33\n5 Sheep = 65\nOffered Value = 98\n\n10 Brick = 10 * 21 = 210\n5 Wood = 5 * 8 = 40\nRequested Value = 250\nNet Gain = 250 - 98 = 152. This is a huge gain for me. Player 1 will likely reject it. It's too good for me.\n\nI need a smaller, positive gain.\n\nLet's try to gain a small amount of value (say, 10-20 points).\nMy highest value resource is Ore (33). My lowest is Wheat (6).\nI have a ton of Sheep (25) and Brick (23).\n\nLet's offer a lot of Sheep for a moderate amount of Ore.\n[Offer: 10 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\n10 Sheep = 130\n3 Ore = 99\nNet gain = 99 - 130 = -31. Bad.\n\nOkay, let's offer something I have a LOT of (Sheep/Brick) for something that is valuable (Ore/Brick/Wood), aiming for a slight value increase.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of a low-value resource for a smaller quantity of a high value resource?\n\n[Offer: 8 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\n8 Sheep = 8 * 13 = 104\n2 Brick = 2 * 21 = 42\nNet Gain = 42 - 104 = -62. Bad.\n\nThis is harder than it seems to make an offer that is beneficial to me and potentially acceptable by the opponent.\nLet's consider Player 1's perspective. What might they need?\nThey rejected my previous offer that gave them 5 Brick and 2 Sheep in exchange for 3 Sheep and 2 Ore.\nPerhaps they don't value Brick or Sheep as highly as I do. Or they don't have 2 Ore.\n\nSo, I should ask for resources that Player 1 might have in abundance or value less, and offer resources that Player 1 might need or value more.\n\nI have 25 Sheep and 23 Brick. I have low Wheat (6) and low Ore (8).\n\nLet's make an offer where I get 1 Ore.\nTo get 1 Ore (33 value), what can I offer that is less than 33 value but still seems fair?\nI can offer 2 Brick (42) (too much). I can offer 3 Sheep (39) (too much). I can offer 5 Wheat (30) (too little Wheat for me to give).\n\nHow about combining?\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n1 Brick = 21\n1 Sheep = 13\nOffered Value = 34\n1 Ore = 33\nNet Gain = 33 - 34 = -1. This is a loss, albeit small.\n\nI need a positive gain.\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Wheat]\n1 Brick = 21\n2 Wood = 16\nOffered Value = 37\n\n1 Ore = 33\n1 Wheat = 6\nRequested Value = 39\nNet Gain = 39 - 37 = 2. This is a net gain for me! This is a good offer for me. It's close to balanced, so Player 1 might accept it.\n\nI am offering resources I have a good amount of (Brick: 23, Wood: 19) for resources I have less of (Ore: 8, Wheat: 6).\nThis seems like a solid offer.\n\nI will propose this.\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Wheat]",
