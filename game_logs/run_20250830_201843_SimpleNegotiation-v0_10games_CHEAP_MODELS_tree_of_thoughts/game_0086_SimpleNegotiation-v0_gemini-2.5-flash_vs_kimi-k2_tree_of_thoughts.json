      "response": "Based on the current offer from Player 1: Offered items: 4 Sheep -> Requested items: 3 Brick.\n\nLet's evaluate the offer from my perspective as Player 0.\n\nMy current resources:\n*   Wheat: 11 (Value: 6)\n*   Wood: 21 (Value: 9)\n*   Sheep: 25 (Value: 13)\n*   Brick: 11 (Value: 20)\n*   Ore: 17 (Value: 34)\n\nValue of Player 1's offer (resources offered by Player 1, which I would receive):\n*   4 Sheep * 13 = 52\n\nValue of Player 1's request (resources requested by Player 1, which I would give away):\n*   3 Brick * 20 = 60\n\nIf I accept this trade, I would receive 52 value and give away 60 value. This would decrease my total value by 8. This is not beneficial for me.\n\nTherefore, I should deny this offer.\n\nNext, I need to make a new offer. My goal is to increase my total value. I have a good amount of Sheep and Wood, and I'm always looking for high-value items like Ore and Brick, as they have higher individual values.\n\nLooking at the previous successful trade, I offered 5 Sheep for 2 Brick. This suggests Player 1 might value Brick. Also, Player 1 made an offer requesting Brick.\n\nI previously tried offering Sheep and Wood for Ore, which was rejected.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, which has the highest value per unit.\n\nPerhaps I can offer some higher quantity of low-value resources for a high-value resource.\n\nConsider offering Wood and Sheep for Ore.\nIf I offer 7 Wood (7 * 9 = 63) and 2 Sheep (2 * 13 = 26), total value offered is 89.\nIf I request 2 Ore (2 * 34 = 68). The value transfer is negative for me.\n\nLet's reconsider what Player 1 is looking for. They offered Sheep for Brick. They previously asked for Brick.\n\nI have a decent amount of Brick (11), but it's valuable.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood for Ore, as I have a lot of Wood.\nIf I offer 8 Wood (8 * 9 = 72) for 2 Ore (2 * 34 = 68). This is not good for me.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick, as it's a good intermediate value and Player 1 seems interested in it.\n\nWhat if I offer a large amount of Sheep, which I have plenty of, for a smaller amount of Brick?\nI have 25 Sheep.\nIf I offer 7 Sheep (7 * 13 = 91) for 4 Brick (4 * 20 = 80). Not ideal.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again. Player 1 rejected 3 Sheep, 5 Wood -> 1 Ore (Value 3*13+5*9 = 39+45 = 84 -> 1*34 = 34). This was a bad offer from me in hindsight.\n\nI need to make an offer where I get more value than I give.\nI want to target Ore or Brick.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of resources I have a lot of for a single item of higher value?\n\nPerhaps offer a combination of Wheat and Wood or Sheep.\nI have 11 Wheat (value 6).\nI have 21 Wood (value 9).\nI have 25 Sheep (value 13).\n\nLet's try to offload some Wheat and get something useful.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (5 * 6 = 30) + 3 Wood (3 * 9 = 27) = 57 value\nRequest: 2 Brick (2 * 20 = 40 value). Still not good enough.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nIf I offer: 12 Wood (12 * 9 = 108) for 3 Ore (3 * 34 = 102). Very close, but still losing 6 value.\n\nWhat if I offer resources near the value of what I want to obtain?\nI want Ore (34).\nI could offer:\n*   3 Sheep (3 * 13 = 39). Trade only if I can get Ore + something else.\n*   4 Wood (4 * 9 = 36). Good parity. Offer 4 Wood for 1 Ore.\n*   6 Wheat (6 * 6 = 36). Good parity. Offer 6 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n\nGiven my abundance of Wood, I think this is a good offer to try. I have 21 wood. Giving up 4 is fine.\nMy value of 4 Wood is 36. Value of 1 Ore is 34. This means I would lose 2 value. Not good.\n\nI need to make sure the value of requested items is higher than offered items.\n\nLet's try to target Ore as it's the highest value.\nI have a lot of Sheep.\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (2 * 13 = 26) for 1 Ore (34). I gain 8 value. This is a very good deal for me. Player 1 might deny it.\n\nBased on player 1's current offer, they seem interested in getting Brick (3 Brick). They are willing to offer 4 Sheep for it.\nMy Brick value is 20, Sheep value is 13.\n4 Sheep (52) for 3 Brick (60). Player 1 is offering 52 value for 60 value from me. This is not good for me.\n\nMy turn's actions:\n1. Deny Player 1's unfavorable offer.\n2. Make a new offer.\n\nMy offer philosophy:\n*   Target high value items: Ore (34), Brick (20).\n*   Offer items I have in abundance or lower value: Wheat (6), Wood (9), Sheep (13).\n*   Ensure requested value > offered value.\n\nLet's try an aggressive offer for Ore, which is what I want the most. I have 17 Ore. Getting more is good.\nOffer: 3 Sheep (3 * 13 = 39)\nRequest: 1 Ore (1 * 34 = 34) and 1 Wheat (1 * 6 = 6). Total requested: 40 value.\nThis means I offer 39 value and gain 40 value, which is positive 1 value. This is a valid profitable trade for me.\nThe previous rejection of 3 Sheep, 5 Wood -> 1 Ore (84 -> 34) was because the offered value was too high for the requested.\n\nLet's simplify. Offer a single item for a single item if possible, but only if it's profitable.\nCan I offer 4 Wood (36) for 1 Ore (34)? No, lose 2.\nCan I offer 3 Sheep (39) for 1 Ore (34)? No, lose 5.\n\nI need to make an offer that is appealing to Player 1, but also profitable for me.\n\nPerhaps offering a lot of a cheap resource for a small amount of a valuable one.\nExample: 10 Wheat (60) for 2 Brick (40)? No.\n10 Wood (90) for 3 Brick (60)? No.\n\nWhat about trying to trade for Brick again?\nI currently have 11 Brick.\n\nMy previous accepted trade was 5 Sheep (65) for 2 Brick (40). This was not a good trade for me, I lost 25 value on that trade. I misunderstood the value calculation then. I must ensure requested value > offered value.\n\nLet's re-evaluate after the Player 1's acceptance of my horrible previous offer.\nResources (after 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick):\nWheat: 11\nWood: 21\nSheep: 20 (25-5)\nBrick: 13 (11+2)\nOre: 17\n\nMy values now:\nWheat: 11   Value: 66\nWood: 21    Value: 189\nSheep: 20   Value: 260\nBrick: 13   Value: 260\nOre: 17     Value: 578\nTotal: 1353\n\nPrevious total: 11*6 + 21*9 + 25*13 + 11*20 + 17*34 = 66 + 189 + 325 + 220 + 578 = 1378.\nMy total value decreased by 25. This is a mistake I cannot repeat.\n\nNow let's go back to the current offer and my required action.\nPlayer 1 offered: 4 Sheep (52) -> Requested: 3 Brick (60).\nMy Resources:\nWheat: 11 (6)\nWood: 21 (9)\nSheep: 20 (13)\nBrick: 13 (20)\nOre: 17 (34)\n\nThis offer still makes me lose value (52 received, 60 given = -8). So, I must Deny.\n\nNow, I must make an offer that increases my value.\nI have a lot of Wood (21) and Sheep (20).\n\nLet's make an offer where I get Ore.\nIf I offer 5 Sheep (65) for 2 Ore (68). I gain 3 value. This is profitable for me.\nPlayer 1 might be interested in Sheep as they just offered Sheep.\nI have 20 Sheep, so giving up 5 is fine.\n\nThis seems like a good, clear offer.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
