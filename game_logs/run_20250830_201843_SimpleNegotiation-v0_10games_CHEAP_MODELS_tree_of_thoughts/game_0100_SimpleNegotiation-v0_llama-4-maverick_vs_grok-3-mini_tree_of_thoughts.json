      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to analyze the current situation and potential trades.\n\nInitially, I have:\n- 22 Wheat (Value: 6)\n- 20 Wood (Value: 10)\n- 16 Sheep (Value: 18)\n- 13 Brick (Value: 21)\n- 12 Ore (Value: 40)\n\nTotal value = (22 * 6) + (20 * 10) + (16 * 18) + (13 * 21) + (12 * 40)\nTotal value = 132 + 200 + 288 + 273 + 480\nTotal value = 1373\n\nTo make a beneficial trade, I need to identify which resources are potentially overvalued or undervalued relative to others. Given the values, Ore is the most valuable resource per unit, and Wheat is the least.\n\nLet's consider making an initial offer that could potentially increase my total value. One strategy is to offer resources with lower value for resources with higher value.\n\nFor example, I can consider offering Wheat or Wood for higher-value resources like Ore, Brick, or Sheep if I don't have enough of them.\n\nSince I have a considerable amount of Wheat and its value is low, I can start by offering Wheat for a more valuable resource.\n\nMy first action will be to make an offer: \n'[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' \n\nThis offer is trying to exchange 10 Wheat (total value = 60) for 1 Ore (value = 40). Although it seems like I'm losing value (60 for 40), the actual strategy here is to test the waters, understand the opponent's willingness to trade, and potentially start a negotiation that could lead to a more favorable trade in subsequent turns.\n\nHowever, given the constraint of the game and the goal to increase total value, let's directly analyze a potentially more beneficial trade.\n\nLet's directly examine a trade that could be more beneficial:\n- Offering less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nMy turn: \n'[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]' \n\nLet's calculate the value of this trade:\n- I'm offering (10 Wheat * 6) + (5 Wood * 10) = 60 + 50 = 110\n- I'm requesting 2 Ore * 40 = 80\n\nThis trade still doesn't seem directly beneficial as I'm offering more value than I'm getting. Let's adjust the strategy.\n\nUpon further review, a potentially beneficial initial trade could involve:\n- Giving away some Wheat or Wood for Sheep or Brick if the rate is favorable.\n\nLet's directly make a more sensible offer:\n'[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Brick]' \n\nValue given: 8 * 6 = 48\nValue received: 1 * 21 = 21\n\nThis is not favorable. Let's adjust:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]' \n\nValue given: (4 * 6) + (1 * 10) = 24 + 10 = 34\nValue received: 1 * 21 = 21\n\nStill not favorable.\n\nRevisiting the initial resources and re-evaluating:\nI will make an offer that tries to get a better deal.\n\nMy turn: \n'[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Sheep]' \n\nValue given: 5 * 10 = 50\nValue received: 2 * 18 = 36\n\nThis is not a good trade for me as it stands. \n\nAfter re-evaluation, a potentially better strategy could be:\n'[Offer: 2 Ore -> 5 Sheep]' \n\nValue given: 2 * 40 = 80\nValue received: 5 * 18 = 90\n\nThis seems like a slightly better trade.\n\nMy first action is: \n'[Offer: 2 Ore -> 5 Sheep]'",
