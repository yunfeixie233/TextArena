      "response": "After evaluating the current state, I see an opportunity to propose a trade that could increase my total resource value while leveraging Player 0's apparent interest in Wood and Wheat from our earlier successful trade. My strategy is to offer a bundle of lower-value resources (Wood and Wheat) in exchange for higher-value Ore, based on the valuation disparity. Here\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n- **Player 0's behavior**: In Turn 1, Player 0 accepted a trade where they gave Brick (high value to me) and Sheep for Wood and Wheat (lower value). This suggests Player 0 values Wood/Wheat more than I do or has a surplus of Brick/Sheep. I\u2019ll exploit this by offering more Wood/Wheat to acquire Ore, my highest-value resource.\n  \n- **Proposed trade**: Offer **12 Wood** and **5 Wheat** for **4 Ore**.\n  - **My valuation**: \n    - Giving: 12 Wood (12 \u00d7 8 = 96) + 5 Wheat (5 \u00d7 5 = 25) = **121 total value loss**.\n    - Receiving: 4 Ore (4 \u00d7 34 = 136) = **136 total value gain**.\n    - **Net gain**: +15 value.\n  - **Risk**: Player 0 might not have enough Ore, but the potential upside justifies the offer. If rejected, I retain resources and try alternatives next turn.\n\nThis trade converts surplus low-value resources into high-value Ore, aligning with my goal to maximize total value. I'll use the required format for the offer.\n\n[Offer: 12 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 4 Ore]",
