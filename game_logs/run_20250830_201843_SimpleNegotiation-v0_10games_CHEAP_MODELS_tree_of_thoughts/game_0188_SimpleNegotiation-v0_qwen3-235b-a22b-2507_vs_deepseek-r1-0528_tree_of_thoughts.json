      "response": "After reviewing the previous interactions, I see that Player 0 has shown interest in trading Wheat and Wood, as they offered these resources for my Ore in their first move. Since I value Wheat and Wood relatively low (6 and 9 per unit, respectively) and have a surplus of Brick (valued at 23 per unit), I propose a trade that leverages this. I'm offering Brick, which has a high value to me but might be more desirable to Player 0, in exchange for Wood and Wheat. This trade would increase my total resource value if accepted, as I'm trading a higher-value resource for larger quantities of lower-value resources in a way that results in a net gain for me.\n\nI propose:  \n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 15 Wood, 5 Wheat]  \n\n**Why this offer?**  \n- I give 5 Brick (value to me: 5 \u00d7 23 = 115).  \n- I request 15 Wood and 5 Wheat (value to me: 15 \u00d7 9 = 135 + 5 \u00d7 6 = 30, total 165).  \n- Net gain for me: 165 - 115 = +50 value.  \n- This trade is favorable from my valuation perspective, and it aligns with Player 0's previous behavior of offering Wheat and Wood. If Player 0 values Brick highly or has excess Wood/Wheat, it could be appealing to them.\n\nI look forward to your response, Player 0.
