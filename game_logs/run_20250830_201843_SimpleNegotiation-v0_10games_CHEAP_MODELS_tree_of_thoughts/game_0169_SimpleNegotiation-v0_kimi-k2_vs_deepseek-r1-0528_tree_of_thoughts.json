      "response": "Alright, let's take a look at what just happened and how to proceed. The previous trade was:\n\n- I traded **4 Wood for 3 Sheep**, which improved my total value:  \n  **I gave up 4 Wood** (value 9 each \u2192 **-36 total**), and **received 3 Sheep** (value 16 each \u2192 **+48 total**).  \n  **Net gain: +12**.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve got:\n- Wheat: 17  \n- Wood: 19  \n- Sheep: 25  \n- Brick: 16  \n- Ore: 9  \n\nPlayer 1 just offered:  \n**Offer: 3 Sheep \u2192 4 Wood**\n\nLet's break this down:\n- I give 3 Sheep \u2192 **-48** (3\u00d716)  \n- I receive 4 Wood \u2192 **+36** (4\u00d79)  \n**Net loss: -12**.\n\nThis trade would undo the value gain I just made. **I reject this.**\n\n---\n\nNow it\u2019s **my turn to offer**.\n\nI want to keep targeting high-value **Brick** and **Ore**. My current holdings are strong in **Sheep**, but **Brick** and **Ore** are both low and high-value.\n\nI\u2019ll offer **some Sheep for Ore and Brick**, but I need to make it more appealing than before.\n\nLet\u2019s offer:\n\n**[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 2 Brick]**\n\nThat\u2019s:\n- Giving: 5 Sheep \u2192 5\u00d716 = **-80**  \n- Getting: 2 Ore + 2 Brick \u2192 2\u00d735 + 2\u00d724 = **+118**  \nNet gain: **+38** \u2014 great for me, and a decent deal for Player 1 if they\u2019re low on Sheep.\n\nLet's see if Player 1 accepts.",
