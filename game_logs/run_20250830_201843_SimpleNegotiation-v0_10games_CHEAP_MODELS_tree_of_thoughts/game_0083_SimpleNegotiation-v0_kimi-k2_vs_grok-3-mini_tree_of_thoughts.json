Brick is abundant (22 qty, 28 value) and is the most bulky single resource I have.  \n2. Ore is extremely valuable per unit (39) so I\u2019ll avoid parting with it except for high-value gains.  \n3. Sheep is my next best value-density (15); Wood and Wheat trail at 8 and 6, so I can use them as flexible fillers.\n\nI\u2019d like to convert excess Brick (and possibly Wood/Wheat) into higher-value Ore first, and might exchange some Sheep to thin, not eliminate, that pile.\n\nLet\u2019s open discussion.\n\n[Speech] Hello! I\u2019m looking to improve my port\u00adfolio of resources. I have considerable Brick and some Wood/Wheat I\u2019m willing to part with. My biggest interest right now is acquiring more Ore.
