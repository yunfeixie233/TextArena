      "response": "Let\u2019s first consolidate the resource totals we now actually possess after these trades, and how their value has shifted.\n\nBefore the six recorded transactions:\n  Wheat  5  -> 5 value  \n  Wood  22 -> 10  \n  Sheep 13 -> 13  \n  Brick 15 -> 23  \n  Ore   22 -> 37  \n\nAfter the six recorded moves:\n\n- Trade #1 (initiated by me):  \n  Lose 6 Wood \u201310 \u2192 16 Wood  \n  Lose 2 Ore \u201337 \u2192 20 Ore  \n  Gain 4 Brick +23 \u2192 19 Brick  \n  Gain 2 Wheat +5 \u2192 7 Wheat  \n\n- Trade #6 (initiated by Player 1 and accepted by me):  \n  Lose 3 Ore \u201337 \u2192 17 Ore  \n  Gain 5 Wheat +25 \u2192 12 Wheat  \n  Gain 4 Wood +20 \u2192 20 Wood  \n  Gain 1 Brick +23 \u2192 20 Brick  \n\nCurrent inventory & aggregate values\n  Wheat : 12  \u2192 60  \n  Wood  : 20  \u2192 100  \n  Sheep : 13  \u2192 169  \n  Brick : 20  \u2192 460  \n  Ore   : 17  \u2192 629  \n\nTotal value now: 1 418 points.\n(Task for later: compute what fraction of that 1 418 corresponds to stuff we plan never to give up.)\n\nTaking stock of my needs\n\n1. Brick is the single most valuable resource by far (23 pts each, already have 20), so I want to keep acquiring it.  \n2. Ore is the second most valuable (37 pts each). I currently have 17. Further upward pressure on Ore is good, but I also need to remain able to bid for Brick.  \n3. Sheep/13, Wood/10 and Wheat/5 are the lower-tier commodities; shedding them selectively is wise. Wheat is the lightest, Wood next. Sheep is sometimes attractive to the opponent, so I\u2019ll retain decent trade leverage there.\n\nTherefore, in this turn my priorities are:\n\n- Seek more Brick first, Ore second.  \n- Offer Wheat > Wood > Sheep in that order as throw-ins.\n\nTrade proposal for Player 1\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 4 Brick, 2 Ore]\n\nRationale:\n- Player 1 just accepted a pile of Wheat & Wood, signalling a willingness to take both again.  \n- I am giving two high-volume resources (5 Wood + 2 Wheat worth 60 pts) and receiving four Brick (92 pts) + two Ore (74 pts) with net +106 in pure shot value.  \n- After the deal I hold 15 Wood, 10 Wheat, 21 Brick, 19 Ore \u2013 a much stronger high-value profile while still keeping enough Wood/Wheat surplus to trade again if needed.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 4 Brick, 2 Ore]",
