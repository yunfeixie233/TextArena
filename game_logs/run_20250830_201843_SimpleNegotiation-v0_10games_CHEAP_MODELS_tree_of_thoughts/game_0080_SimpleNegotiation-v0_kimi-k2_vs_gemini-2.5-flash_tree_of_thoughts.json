There seems to be zero appetite for Wheat-for-Wood exchanges, so I\u2019ll change my approach: try to ship Wheat and Sheep (medium value/ easy abundance) toward more Brick and Ore (highest value).\n\nI have 6 Wheat and 12 Sheep left\u2014enough surplus to make something attractive.\n\nNext offer:\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 5 Sheep -> 4 Brick, 1 Ore]",
