Since the last trade was beneficial and considering the current quantities:\n- We have 18 Sheep, 21 Ore, and other resources.\n\nTo increase the total value, we should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but more quantity isn't necessarily beneficial unless it leads to a more significant gain in the future.\n\nOne potential trade could involve giving away some Wheat (low value) or Sheep (moderate value) for Ore (high value) or Brick (high value), but we need to be cautious about depleting resources that could be used for future beneficial trades.\n\nLet's consider an example trade offer:\n- We can offer 2 Wheat (Value: 5*2 = 10) for 1 Brick (Value: 20). This increases our total value.\n\nThe proposed trade offer would be: `[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThus, the action for this turn is: `[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`",

The net gain is 36 - 5*8 = -4.\n\n3. **Current State After Last Trade**:\n   - Wheat: 13 - 2 = 11\n   - Wood: 23 - 5 = 18\n   - Sheep: 20 - 2 = 18\n   - Brick: 13 + 1 = 14\n   - Ore: 20 + 1 + 1 = 22\n\n4. **New Offer Consideration**:\n   - The task now is to decide on the next offer. We need to assess what we have and what we can offer or request to increase our total value.\n\n5. **Resources and Values**:\n   - [Wheat]   Qty: 11   Value: 5   Total: 55\n   - [Wood]    Qty: 18   Value: 8   Total: 144\n   - [Sheep]   Qty: 18   Value: 15  Total: 270\n   - [Brick]   Qty: 14   Value: 20  Total: 280\n   - [Ore]     Qty: 22   Value: 36  Total: 792\n\n6. **Total Current Value**: 55 + 144 + 270 + 280 + 792 = 1541\n\n### Decision for Next Turn:\nTo increase the total value, we should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given the current resources and their values, trading away resources like Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 8) for higher-value resources like Ore (Value: 36) or Brick (Value: 20) could be beneficial.\n\n### Next Action:\nLet's consider offering some Wheat or Wood for Ore, as Ore has the highest value. We have Wheat and Wood available.\n\n### Offer:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' is a potential offer because it involves trading lower-value resources for a higher-value one. The calculation is as follows:\n- Losing 4 Wheat (4 * 5 = 20)\n- Gaining 1 Ore (1 * 36 = 36)\n- Net gain: 36 - 20 = 16\n\nThus, the action is: **[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]**",
