      "response": "Given the trading history and my current resources, I must propose a trade to further increase my total value. My current inventory is:\n\n- Wheat: 11 (Value: 5 each)  \n- Wood: 13 (Value: 9 each)  \n- Sheep: 32 (Value: 18 each)  \n- Brick: 23 (Value: 28 each)  \n- Ore: 12 (Value: 35 each)  \n\nTo optimize value, I aim to trade away lower-value resources (Sheep and Wood) for higher-value ones (Brick and Ore). The previous identical offer of 5 Sheep and 10 Wood for 8 Brick and 1 Ore was accepted, resulting in a significant value gain (calculated as receiving 259 value in exchange for 180, a net gain of 79). Repeating this trade leverages the opponent's apparent willingness to accept such exchanges, especially since they have consistently offered Sheep and Wood in past trades, indicating a surplus.\n\nProposed trade:  \n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 10 Wood -> 8 Brick, 1 Ore]  \n\nThis offer is beneficial because:  \n- I give low-value resources: 5 Sheep (90 value) + 10 Wood (90 value) = 180 total  \n- I receive high-value resources: 8 Brick (224 value) + 1 Ore (35 value) = 259 total  \n- Net gain: 79 value  \n- After trade, my Wood reduces to 3, which is acceptable due to its low value.  \n\nThis maintains a focus on acquiring high-value resources while offusing excess Sheep and Wood.  \n\nTo Player 1: I propose exchanging 5 Sheep and 10 Wood for 8 Brick and 1 Ore. This mirrors our last successful trade and benefits both parties. What do you think?",
