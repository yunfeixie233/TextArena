Since Ore and Brick are high-value, let's see if we can get more of those or keep them. Sheep is relatively high in quantity and value.\n\nI'll offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nThis is to test the waters and see how the opponent values Sheep relative to Wheat.\n\n**Turn 1 Action:** `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`",

Offering Sheep for Ore, given its high value.\n\nSince the previous offer of 3 Sheep for 1 Ore was rejected, we might need to offer more Sheep or consider offering a different combination that includes other resources.\n\nLet's consider an alternative offer.

      "response": "Since the game is ongoing and it's not specified that we are on the last turn or that there's a new offer from Player1, we need to analyze the current state of resources and the history of trades to decide the next action.\n\nThe current state of resources is:\n+ [Wheat] Qty:14 Value:5 (17 initially, 4 traded away, then 3 more)\n+ [Wood] Qty:6 Value:8\n+ [Sheep] Qty:20 Value:12\n+ [Brick] Qty:23 Value:30\n+ [Ore] Qty:7 Value:35 (6 initially, 1 gained from the trade)\n\nLet's examine the trades made and the responses:\n1. Offered 5 Wheat for 1 Sheep, rejected.\n2. Offered 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, accepted. (This was successful, we got Ore which is high value)\n3. Offered 3 Sheep for 1 Ore, rejected.\n4. Offered 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat for 1 Ore, rejected.\n5. Offered 3 Wheat for 1 Ore, rejected.\n\nFrom the history, it's clear that Player1 is interested in Wheat but not willing to give Sheep for it. We successfully traded Wheat for Ore, which is a good trade since Ore has a higher value. However, subsequent attempts to get Ore for Sheep were rejected.\n\nLet's consider the next step:\n- We have Wheat left (14 units), and it's clear Player1 is interested in it.\n- We are low on Ore, and Ore is very valuable.\n\nA possible strategy is to continue offering Wheat for Ore since the initial trade was successful.\n\nConsidering the values:\n- [Wheat] = 5\n- [Ore] = 35\n\n Offering Wheat for Ore is a good deal. Let's try again with a slightly different quantity.\n\n [Offer:2 Wheat ->1 Ore]\n\nThis is the response for the current turn.",
