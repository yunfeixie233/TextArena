I should make an offer.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep and Brick. Sheep has a value of 15 and Brick has a value of 22. Ore has a value of 38. I want to trade up to resources with higher value, specifically Ore. I have 20 Brick and I'm willing to part with some of it. I'm also looking to increase my Brick count, though, if the trade is favorable enough. The ideal trade would be to give away lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\nLet's try to trade Brick for Ore. A Brick is 22, an Ore is 38. That's almost 2 Brick for 1 Ore.\n\nConsider giving 2 Brick (value 44) for 1 Ore (value 38). This would be a loss. I need to make a profit.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of lower value resources for higher value? Wheat (6), Wood (8), Sheep (15).\n\nLet's try trading Brick, which I have a good quantity of, for Ore. I have 20 Brick.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (66) for 2 Ore (76), that's a good trade for me.\n\nThe opponent might want more common resources.\n\nLet's try trading away some excess Sheep and Brick for Ore.\n\nCurrent Value: 1641\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore ]\nMy side: 2 * 22 + 1 * 15 = 44 + 15 = 59\nOpponent side: 1 * 38 = 38\nThis is not a good offer for the opponent.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nMy side: 3 * 15 + 1 * 22 = 45 + 22 = 67\nOpponent side: 1 * 38 = 38\nStill not good for opponent.\n\nI should make an offer that is slightly better for the opponent, or at least appears to be.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep (21). They are valued at 15.\nI have a lot of Brick (20). They are valued at 22.\n\nPerhaps I can offer a combination that is slightly more appealing in raw value, but less valuable to me if I have excess of those types.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Wood, 1 Brick]\nMy side: 3 * 15 + 1 * 6 = 45 + 6 = 51\nOpponent side: 1 * 8 + 1 * 22 = 30\nThis makes no sense. I should be offering things I have a lot of, for things I want more of.\n\nLet's focus on getting Ore. Ore is the highest value resource.\n\nI have 18 Ore, which is good. I want more.\n\nConsider exchanging smaller amounts of high-value resources for larger amounts of lower-value resources if the total value is higher.\n\nLet's try to get Ore by giving up Brick and Sheep.\n1 Ore = 38\n1 Brick = 22\n1 Sheep = 15\n\nIf I offer 1 Brick (22) and 1 Sheep (15), that's a total of 37 value. For 1 Ore (38). That's a good trade for me, and almost fair for the opponent.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nMy side: Lose 1 Brick (22), Lose 1 Sheep (15) = -37\nOpponent side: Gain 1 Ore (38) = +38\nNet gain for me: +1\nThis is a small gain for me, and a small gain for the opponent.
