Since Brick and Ore are highly valued, I can offer Sheep (16 Value) or Wood (9 Value) to get Ore/Brick.\n   - Example: Offer 2 Sheep (Value = 2*16 = 32) + 1 Wood (Value = 9) for 1 Ore (38) + 1 Brick (30). Net gain: (38+30) - (32+9) = +27 Value (similar to rejected offer but using Sheep).\n   - Alternatively: Offer 3 Sheep (48 Value) for 2 Ore (76 Value).
