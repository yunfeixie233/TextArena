This trade is not beneficial for me as it would decrease my total value.\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I have a good quantity of Brick and Ore, which are high-value items, but I also have the most Wheat and Sheep, which are low-value items. I am keen to trade low-value items for high-value items where possible.\n\nI will make a counter-offer that aims to shed some of my lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) for higher-value ones (Brick, Ore), ensuring I gain value.\n\nMy counter-offer: I will offer a significant amount of my lower-value resources for a smaller amount of the higher-value resources.\n\nMy offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood, 5 Sheep (value: 60 + 50 + 65 = 175) for 3 Brick, 2 Ore (value: 90 + 68 = 158)\nThis offer is slightly below par for Player 0, but I have to gain value.\n\nLet's rethink my strategy. I have 25 Wheat, 6 Wood, 15 Sheep, 22 Brick, 13 Ore.\nI want to increase my total value from 1507.\nPlayer 0 offered: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood, 1 Sheep (value 79) for 2 Brick, 1 Ore (value 94). I denied this because it was a net loss of 15 value for me.\n\nI need to make an offer that benefits me.\nThe previous offer from Player 0 was a bad deal for me. I should try to get more for my low-value resources.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick and Ore, as these are my highest value items. I have a good amount of Brick and Ore.\nI have a significant amount of Wheat and Sheep. I want to trade these away.\n\nConsider offering more low-value resources for a smaller quantity of high-value resources. Or, try to get some of the other high-value resources if Player 0 has them.\n\nI have 25 Wheat (value 6), 6 Wood (value 10), 15 Sheep (value 13).\nI have 22 Brick (value 30), 13 Ore (value 34).\n\nLet's evaluate the current offer again strictly regarding value and my current resources.\nPlayer 0 offered 6 Wheat, 3 Wood, 1 Sheep (Value = 36 + 30 + 13 = 79)\nPlayer 0 requested 2 Brick, 1 Ore (Value = 60 + 34 = 94)\nIf I accept this, my total value will decrease by 15 (79 - 94 = -15). This is not good for me.\n\nI need to create an offer that increases my value.\nI want to prioritize trading away Wheat and Wood first, then Sheep.\n\nLet's make a new offer.\nI want to gain high-value items (Brick, Ore) and give away low-value items (Wheat, Wood, Sheep).\n\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of Wheat for a single Brick?\ne.g., 8 Wheat (value 48) for 1 Brick (value 30). This loses me value.\n\nI will try to make an Offer that makes sense for both.\nValue of 2 Brick + 1 Ore = 94.\nValue of 6 Wheat + 3 Wood + 1 Sheep = 79.\n\nWhat if I offer 6 Wheat, 3 Wood, 1 Sheep (Total value 79) AND 1 Brick (value 30) for 2 Ore (value 68)?\nThis is not good.\n\nI need Player 0 to offer more or request less.\nI will try to make an offer that is slightly better for me than the one just proposed by Player 0, and that offloads some of my lower value items.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat and Sheep. I have less Wood.\n\nConsider:\nOffer: 15 Wheat, 5 Sheep (Value: 15*6 + 5*13 = 90 + 65 = 155)\nRequest: 3 Brick, 2 Ore (Value: 3*30 + 2*34 = 90 + 68 = 158)\nThis is still losing me value slightly. I need the value of what I get to be greater than what I give.\n\nLet's reconsider my resources and Player 0's offer.\nPlayer 0's offer: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood, 1 Sheep (value 79) for 2 Brick, 1 Ore (value 94).\nThis is a -15 value trade for me.\n\nI should make an offer where the requested items' value is higher than the offered items' value by a small margin, or where I gain high-value items by trading low-value ones.\n\nLet's aim to get Brick or Ore. I have 22 Brick and 13 Ore. I'm okay trading away some Brick if I get more Ore, or vice versa, if it's a net gain.\n\nHow about I offer low-value items for high-value items, where the high-value items I receive are worth more than what I give away?\n\nOffer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood, 5 Sheep (Value: 60 + 50 + 65 = 175)\nRequest: 4 Brick, 3 Ore (Value: 120 + 102 = 222)\nDifference: +47 value for me. This is too aggressive maybe.\n\nI need to make a reasonable offer.\nThe maximum total value I can gain from a single trade is not capped, but the opponent needs to accept.\n\nI'll reject this offer and make a new one reflecting my strategy for gaining value by trading low value for high value resources.\n\nI will now propose trading a substantial amount of Sheep and Wheat, my two lowest value resources, for a higher value resource like Brick or Ore.\n\nI have 25 Wheat, 15 Sheep.\nHow about:\n[Offer: 12 Wheat, 8 Sheep -> 6 Wood, 2 Brick]\nValue of offered items: (12 * 6) + (8 * 13) = 72 + 104 = 176\nValue of requested items: (6 * 10) + (2 * 30) = 60 + 60 = 120\nThis offer would result in a value loss for me. Not good.\n\nLet's simplify. I want to give low value, get high value.\nWhat if I try to get one high value item for multiple low value items?\n\nMy current total value is 1507.\nI want to increase this.\n\nI will offer 10 Wheat, 5 Sheep (total value: 60 + 65 = 125) for 3 Brick (total value: 90). This is a loss.\n\nMy strategy should be to offer a combination of my low-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) for higher-value resources (Brick, Ore) from Player 0, ensuring my total value increases.\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore. (Player 0 gains 15 Value in this trade)\n\nI will offer a trade that turns this around.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick, 1 Ore -> 6 Wheat, 3 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Brick]\nValue of offered items: 60 + 34 = 94\nValue of requested items: 36 + 30 + 13 + 30 = 109\nThis means I give up 94 value and gain 109 value. A net gain of 15. This is the reverse of Player 0's offer.\nThis might be too aggressive, as Player 0 would lose value in this.\n\nI will try to make a fair offer where both of us gain some value.\nOr I gain some value and Player 0 breaks even.\n\nLet's target Player 0's current offer, and make a slightly better counter-offer for me, slightly worse for them, but still potentially acceptable.\n\nPlayer 0's desired items (from previous offer): 2 Brick, 1 Ore. (Value 94)\nPlayer 0's offered items (from previous offer): 6 Wheat, 3 Wood, 1 Sheep. (Value 79)\n\nI will Offer: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood, 1 Sheep (value 79) AND 1 Brick (value 30) = 109\nRequest: 2 Ore (value 68)\n\nThis means I give 109 value for 68 value. This is worse for me.\n\nI will make an offer for Ore. Ore is the highest value item.\n\nI will offer a combination of low-value items for some high-value items, targeting a net gain for myself.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nI have a lot of Sheep and Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 15 Wheat, 10 Sheep -> 3 Ore, 1 Brick]\nValue of offered: (15 * 6) + (10 * 13) = 90 + 130 = 220\nValue of requested: (3 * 34) + (1 * 30) = 102 + 30 = 132\nThis is a huge loss for me.\n\nI need to make sure the requested value is higher than the offered value.\n\nLet's try a small trade to start and see if Player 0 is willing to trade.\nTargeting to exchange my low-value Wheat and Sheep for higher-value Brick or Ore.\n\nI'll try to trade a significant amount of low-value resources for a modest amount of high-value resources.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]\nValue of offered: (10 * 6) + (5 * 13) = 60 + 65 = 125\nValue of requested: (1 * 30) + (1 * 34) = 30 + 34 = 64\nThis represents a huge loss for me. I need to flip this.\n\nMy turn, I am Player 1.\nI must make an offer that increases my total value.\n\nLet's try:\nOffer: 2 Brick, 1 Ore (Value: 94)\nRequest: 10 Wheat, 6 Wood, 5 Sheep (Value: 60 + 60 + 65 = 185)\nThis is a huge gain for me (+91 value), but unlikely to be accepted.\n\nI need to compromise if I want to increase my chances of a trade.\n\nThe offer from Player 0 was: Offered items: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood, 1 Sheep (value 79) -> Requested items: 2 Brick, 1 Ore (value 94).\n\nI will accept it if I can get some additional high-value resource.\n\nI will make an offer that tries to balance the previous one, and potentially make a small gain.\nI denied their previous offer, and I need to make a new one.\n\nI have 25 Wheat, 6 Wood, 15 Sheep, 22 Brick, 13 Ore.\nTotal Value: 1507.\n\nOffer: 2 Brick, 1 Ore. (Value 94)\nRequest: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Brick. (Value 79 + 30 = 109)\nThis gives me 15 value. This essentially takes their offered items, adds one of my high-value items, and asks for my high-value items back plus one of theirs. This is likely to be rejected.\n\nI need to make an offer where my requested items should collectively have a higher value than my offered items.\n\nLet's try to offload a lot of wheat and sheep.\n[Offer: 15 Wheat, 10 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]\nValue of Offer: 15*6 + 10*13 = 90 + 130 = 220\nValue of Request: 2*30 + 1*34 = 60 + 34 = 94\nThis is losing value for me. I'm struggling with the math.\n\nOk, let me restart my thinking on the offer.\nI want to gain value. So I need to offer items of a certain value and request items of a higher value.\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood, 1 Sheep (Value 79) -> Requested items: 2 Brick, 1 Ore (Value 94).\nThis means Player 0 wanted 94 value and offered 79, a gain of 15 for them.\n\nI will make a counter-offer seeking a similar gain for myself.\nMy offer: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Brick (Value 79 + 30 = 109) -> 2 Ore (Value 68).\nThis is a loss for me. NO.\n\nI need to offer items that I have in abundance and are low value, for items that are high value and I want more of.\n\nLet's make an offer to trade low-value items for high-value items.\nI have a significant amount of Wheat and Sheep.\n\n[Offer: 15 Wheat, 10 Sheep -> 3 Ore, 1 Brick] - Still a loss for me.\n\nI will go for a direct gain for me.\nI will offer 10 Wheat (value 60) and 5 Sheep (value 65) = total 125.\nI will request 2 Brick (value 60) and 2 Ore (value 68) = total 128.\nThis is a gain of 3 value for me. It's modest but a gain.\nThis means I give up 10 Wheat and 5 Sheep, and gain 2 Brick and 2 Ore.\nMy Wheat goes from 25 to 15. My Sheep goes from 15 to 10.\nMy Brick goes from 22 to 24. My Ore goes from 13 to 15.\nThis seems like a positive trade for me, and potentially acceptable for Player 0 as it's not a huge loss for them. Their 2 Brick and 2 Ore (128) for 10 Wheat and 5 Sheep (125). A loss of 3 for them.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable counter-offer.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 2 Ore]",
