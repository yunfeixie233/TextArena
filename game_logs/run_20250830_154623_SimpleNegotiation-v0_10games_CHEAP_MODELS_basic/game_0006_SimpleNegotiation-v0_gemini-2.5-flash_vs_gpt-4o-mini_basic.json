      "response": "Okay, I understand. I am Player 0. My goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I need to be strategic in my offers and acceptances.\n\nHere's a breakdown of my current resources and their values:\n*   Wheat: 12 @ 5 = 60\n*   Wood: 17 @ 10 = 170\n*   Sheep: 16 @ 13 = 208\n*   Brick: 25 @ 30 = 750\n*   Ore: 20 @ 36 = 720\n\nTotal current value = 60 + 170 + 208 + 750 + 720 = 1908\n\nI will now wait for the game to start or for my opponent's action if they are Player 1. If it's my turn, I will formulate an offer. Since I am Player 0, I make the first move.\n\nMy strategy for the first offer will be to try and trade some of my less valuable resources (like Wheat or Wood) for more valuable ones, or to consolidate resources I have in abundance (Brick) into something else if beneficial.\n\nLet's consider what I have a lot of: Brick (25) and Ore (20). These are also my most valuable resources.\nSheep (16), Wood (17), Wheat (12) are lower quantities and lower values.\n\nI want to increase my *total value*.\nLet's try to offload some lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\nTarget: Trade Wheat/Wood for Sheep/Brick/Ore. Or trade some Brick/Ore if I can get a significantly better return.\n\nOffer idea 1: Trade Wheat for something more valuable.\nIf I trade 3 Wheat (value 15), what can I get? Maybe 1 Sheep (value 13)? Not good enough for me.\nMaybe 1 Wood (value 10) + 1 Wheat (value 5) for 1 Sheep (value 13)? Still not good.\n\nLet's try to trade something I have in good quantity (Brick or Ore) for something else, if I can get a better ratio.\n\nI have 25 Brick (value 30 each). If I give 1 Brick (30), I'd want something worth more.\nI have 20 Ore (value 36 each). If I give 1 Ore (36), I'd want something worth more.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, as it's the highest value. What can I give for it?\nPerhaps a mix of lower-value items for one Ore?\n2 Wood (20) + 1 Wheat (5) = 25. Still far from 36.\n3 Wood (30) + 1 Wheat (5) = 35. Close to 36.\n\nLet's consider consolidating my resources to fewer types, if it's overall worth more.\nOr simply trying to get *more* of the high-value resources.\n\nInitial offer: Let's try to get some Ore.\nI have abundant Brick.\nOffer: 1 Brick (value 30) for 1 Ore (value 36). This is a pure win for me. Player might not accept.\n\nLet's try something slightly more nuanced.\nI want to get Ore (36) or Brick (30).\nI have some Sheep (13), Wood (10), Wheat (5) I could part with.\n\nConsider this: I have 25 Brick. Maybe I can trade some for a higher-value resource if the opponent needs Brick.\n\nHow about: Trade some lower value resources for a higher value one, but at a fair or slightly advantageous rate for me.\n\nOffer: [Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep, 1 Wood]\nMy Offer: 2 Wood (20) + 2 Wheat (10) = 30\nTheir Offer: 1 Sheep (13) + 1 Wood (10) = 23\nThis is not good for me.\n\nLet's aim for a clear value increase.\nMy highest value resources are Ore (36) and Brick (30).\nMy lowest value are Wheat (5) and Wood (10).\n\nHow about giving something I have a lot of, like Brick, to get something more valuable, like Ore, if I can make the deal sweet enough for them?\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]\nMy offer: 2 Brick = 60\nTheir offer: 1 Ore (36) + 1 Sheep (13) = 49\nNo, this is bad for me. I need to be asking for *more* value than I give.\n\nLet's reverse it. I want Ore. What can I give?\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nMy Offer: 1 Sheep (13) + 2 Wood (20) = 33\nTheir Gain: 1 Ore (36)\nThis is a small win for me (36 vs 33). Might be acceptable for the opponent if they need sheep/wood.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
