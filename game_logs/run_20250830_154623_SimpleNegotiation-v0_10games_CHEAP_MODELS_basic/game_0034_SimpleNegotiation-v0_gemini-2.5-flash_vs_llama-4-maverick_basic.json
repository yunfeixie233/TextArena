Now, you need to consider making a counteroffer that could potentially increase your total resource value.\n\n   Let's analyze what you can offer or request:\n   - You have a surplus of Sheep, Brick, and a considerable amount of Wood.\n   - Ore is very valuable, but you're not in a position to give it away as seen from the evaluations above.\n\n4. **Potential Offer:**\n   Considering your resources and the values, a potential offer could involve trading some of your less valuable resources for something more valuable or at least equally valuable.\n\n   Let's propose an offer: `[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n   - You give: 4 Sheep (4*13 = 52) and 2 Wood (2*11 = 22), Total = 74\n   - You receive: 1 Brick (1*24 = 24)\n   - This is not a good trade for you as you're losing value (74 - 24 = 50).\n\n   Let's think of a more viable offer: `[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]`\n   - You give: 2 Brick (2*24 = 48)\n   - You receive: 1 Ore (1*40 = 40)\n   - This is still not beneficial as you're giving up more value than you're getting.\n\n   A potentially better offer could be: `[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep, 1 Wood]`\n   - You give: 1 Ore (40)\n   - You receive: 3 Sheep (3*13 = 39) and 1 Wood (11), Total = 50\n   - This is still not advantageous.\n\nLet's directly evaluate a straightforward trade that might benefit you, focusing on acquiring more valuable resources or maintaining your current value while getting rid of less valuable resources.\n\nGiven the third offer from Player 0 is still on the table: `[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`, let's re-evaluate the potential for a counteroffer.\n\nSince none of the straightforward trades seem immediately beneficial based on the values, and considering you have already rejected Player 0's offers, a potential next step is to make a counteroffer that is reasonable.\n\nLet's consider: `[Offer: 2 Brick, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n- You give: 2 Brick (48) + 1 Wood (11) = 59\n- You receive: 1 Ore (40)\n- This is not a good trade.\n\nHowever, thinking along similar lines, a more reasonable counteroffer could be: `[Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 3 Sheep, 1 Ore]` is not valid since you're requesting more Sheep than you're offering, let's adjust our thinking.\n\nA simple counter to the last offer could be: `[Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Sheep]`\n- This implies giving 1 Ore (40) for 4 Sheep (4*13 = 52), which is actually beneficial for you as you're gaining 52 - 40 = 12 in value.\n\nSo, your action for this turn could be: `[Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Sheep]`\n\nThus, the response is: `[Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Sheep]`.",
