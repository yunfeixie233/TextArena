That\u2019s a big loss (\u2248 65 \u201cpoints\u201d).\n\n### My Own Values\nCurrent total value:  \n\u2013 Wheat: 23\u00d75 = 115  \n\u2013 Wood: 20\u00d711 = 220  \n\u2013 Sheep: 9\u00d717 = 153  \n\u2013 Brick: 9\u00d720 = 180  \n\u2013 Ore: 20\u00d735 = 700  \n\nTotal: 115 + 220 + 153 + 180 + 700 = 1 368.\n\n### Decision on the Offer\nPlainly, the offer hurts me by 65 payoff points, so I must decline.\n\n### A New Offer Structure\nInstead of simply rejecting, I can propose a counter-offer that actually benefits me.\n\nWhat I have in surplus: Ore (best value but I have 20, so I could afford to give a few).\n\nWhat I need to get for a better portfolio: Sheep (only 9) and Brick (only 9) since both are valuable but scarce.\n\nI will ask for equal or slightly fewer units than are offered, and offer fewer but very high-value Ore to make the deal still desirable for Player 0.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n[Offer: 3 Ore -> 2 Sheep, 2 Brick]\n\nEffect on me:\n\u2013 Get: 2\u00d717 + 2\u00d720 = 34 + 40 = +74  \n\u2013 Give: 3\u00d735 = \u2013105  \nNet: \u201331 (loss), so this isn\u2019t good either. I need to receive more.\n\nLet\u2019s reverse the ratio slightly:\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Sheep, 2 Brick]  \nGet: 3\u00d717 + 2\u00d720 = 51 + 40 = +91  \nGive: 2\u00d735 = \u201370  \nNet: +21. That\u2019s a gain of 21.\n\nThis looks balanced: 2 high-value Ore for 3 Sheep (interesting on their side, because Sheep is only worth 17) plus 2 Brick (worth 20).
