Brick is next-highest in value (23), while Sheep/Wood are comparatively lower (12 and 8). To further increase value, I should convert my three lowest-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) into Brick while still keeping at least a small stock of Brick to balance my portfolio.\n\nTrade idea #1: I could go aggressive and offer 10 Wood (10\u00d78 = 80 value) for 3 Brick (3\u00d723 = 69 value). That\u2019s \u201311 value for me, so Player 1 would profit but I would lose\u2014bad. Reject.\n\nTrade idea #2: Offer Sheep for Brick at above-market rate. 2 Sheep are worth 2\u00d712 = 24; 1 Brick is worth 23.  So offering 4 Sheep for 2 Brick is even. But I want to net gain value; hence I need to extract more Brick relative to what I give. 3 Sheep (36 value) for 1 Brick (23) is a tough sell.  \n\nTrade idea #3: I still have excess Wheat left. If I dump 6 Wheat (36 value) for 1 Brick (23), I destroy 13 value\u2014again negative. Wheat alone is now awfully weak.\n\nTrade idea #4: Bundle Wood and Sheep so the per-unit value looks attractive to Player 1. Let\u2019s construct an offset that looks favourable to them but still boosts my high-value Brick line.\n\nProposal: give away a modest basket of my lowest-value cards (Wood + Wheat) in exchange for high-value Brick plus one Sheep to keep proportions polite.  I can part with 3 Wood (24) + 3 Wheat (18) = 42 value. In return I request 2 Brick (46 value), which is a modest net value gain (+4). That should feel reasonably attractive to Player 1.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 2 Brick, 0 Sheep]",
