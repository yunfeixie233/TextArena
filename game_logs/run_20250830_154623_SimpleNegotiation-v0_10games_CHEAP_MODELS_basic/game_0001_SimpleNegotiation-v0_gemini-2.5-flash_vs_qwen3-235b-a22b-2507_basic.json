      "response": "My current resources are:\n\t+ Wheat: 5 (Value: 5)\n\t+ Wood: 8 (Value: 10)\n\t+ Sheep: 22 (Value: 16)\n\t+ Brick: 19 (Value: 28)\n\t+ Ore: 25 (Value: 37)\n\nThe previous offer of 5 Sheep -> 3 Wheat was rejected. My Sheep quantity is high (22), and their value is lower (16) compared to other resources. Wheat has a low quantity (5) and a low value (5). It seems Player 1 doesn't want to trade their Wheat for my Sheep, or they feel the trade is not beneficial enough.\n\nI need to increase my total resource value. To do this, I should try to trade resources I have in abundance or those with lower individual value for resources that have higher individual value or are scarce in my inventory.\n\nLet's rethink the offer. I have a lot of Sheep. Trading Sheep for Wheat would increase my Wheat quantity, but Wheat's value is quite low. I have a lot of Ore and Brick, both valuable resources.\n\nPerhaps I should try to trade away some Sheep or Wood for something more valuable like Ore or Brick, or to get more Wheat if I can get it at a good rate.\n\nConsidering the last denial, Player 1 might see more value in their Wheat than I estimated, or my offer of 5 Sheep was too much for 3 Wheat.\n\nLet's try a different approach. I have 22 Sheep. I need to offload some of them. Also, Wheat and Wood have lower current value. Brick and Ore are high value.\n\nLet's try to get more valuable resources by offering something I have in plenty.\n\nOffer: I will offer a resource I have in abundance for a more valuable resource. I have 22 Sheep, 19 Brick, and 25 Ore.\n\nI'll try to get some Ore or Brick since they have high value. Or, maybe I could get some Wheat and Wood to diversify, but the value increase would be minimal unless I get a lot.\n\nWhat about trading some Sheep for Brick or Ore?\nIf I offer Sheep, the value of 1 Sheep is 16/22 = 0.72.\nThe value of 1 Brick is 28/19 = 1.47.\nThe value of 1 Ore is 37/25 = 1.48.\n\nSo, 1 Brick is roughly equivalent to 2 Sheep in value. And 1 Ore is roughly 2 Sheep.\n\nLet's try trading a large quantity of Sheep for a smaller quantity of a higher value resource.\nI have plenty of Sheep, so giving up 10 Sheep (value ~7.2) for 3 Brick (value ~4.41) doesn't look good for me.\n\nI need to make an offer that feels mutually beneficial. Maybe Player 1 has a lot of a resource that I value.\n\nSince Player 1 rejected the Sheep for Wheat trade, it's possible they don't value Sheep much, or they do value Wheat highly.\n\nLet's consider trading away some of my Ore. I have 25 Ore. It's my most valuable resource. But I want to increase my total value, not just hoard high-value resources. Sometimes trading a high-value resource for more of another high-value resource, or for a diverse set of resources can be good.\n\nLet's try to get some Wheat or Wood, as my quantities are relatively low for those. But I want to do it in a way that increases my net value.\n\nMaybe Player 1 needs Sheep, or Wood, if they have limited amounts.\n\nMy current resource values:\nWheat: 5 units * (5/5) value per unit = 5\nWood: 8 units * (10/8) value per unit = 10\nSheep: 22 units * (16/22) value per unit = 16\nBrick: 19 units * (28/19) value per unit = 28\nOre: 25 units * (37/25) value per unit = 37\nTotal Value = 5 + 10 + 16 + 28 + 37 = 96\n\nLet's try to trade some Sheep and Brick, which I have in abundance, for something more valuable or to diversify my portfolio.\n\nOffer: I will offer a mix of resources for something.\nLet's try to get Ore which is high value, or diversify to get Wheat/Wood.\nPlayer 1 must value the resources offered too.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of things that I have a lot of for just one type of resource that is valuable?\n\nI'll try again with the Sheep, but this time for something more valuable.\nHow about trading a lot of Sheep for some Ore?\n10 Sheep (value approx 7.2) for 5 Ore (value approx 7.4). This seems fair.\nHowever, I have 25 Ore already, so gaining more Ore might not be optimal unless Player 1 has very little Ore and values it highly.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick. I have 19 Brick.\n10 Sheep (value approx 7.2) for 5 Brick (value approx 7.35). This looks like a reasonable exchange value-wise for me.\n\nI need to consider what Player 1 might need.\nIf they just denied 5 Sheep for 3 Wheat, perhaps they don't need Sheep, or they have too many.\nMaybe they need Brick or Ore if they are building something, or they need Wheat or Wood if they are trying to expand.\n\nLet's offer something that I have plenty of and is lower value, for something I have less of and is higher value or something I need to diversify.\n\nConsider my most abundant resources: Sheep (22), Ore (25), Brick (19).\nMy least abundant: Wheat (5), Wood (8).\n\nI could try to trade some Sheep and some Wood for Wheat. This would increase my lowest quantity resources.\nOr I could try to trade some Sheep for more Brick.\n\nLet's propose something that is clearly beneficial to me value-wise, but also attractive to Player 1.\nIf I offer a good quantity of Sheep for a smaller quantity of Brick, I consolidate value.\n\n[Offer: 10 Sheep -> 5 Brick]\nThis reduces my high quantity of Sheep and increases my quantity of Brick.\nValue of 10 Sheep = 10 * (16/22) = 7.27\nValue of 5 Brick = 5 * (28/19) = 7.37\nThis looks like a slight value increase for me and probably fair for Player 1.\nIt also allows me to rebalance my stock.\n\n[Offer: 10 Sheep -> 5 Brick]",
