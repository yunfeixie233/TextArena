What is your next move?\nIn the previous turn, you offered: Offered items: 5 Sheep -> Requested items: 3 Ore.\nPlayer 0 has rejected this offer multiple times. It seems like Player 0 does not want to trade 3 Ore for 5 Sheep (Value 80).\nYour previous offers have been consistent. It's time to try a new strategy.\nLet's analyze your current inventory and try to find a mutually beneficial trade.\nYou have a good amount of Brick and Wheat, both of which have lower values. You also have a decent amount of Sheep.\nOre is your most valuable resource (38).\nYou currently have 13 Sheep (Value: 16 each) and 10 Ore (Value: 38 each).\n\nConsidering Player 0 rejected 5 Sheep for 3 Ore, let's consider offering something else they might want, or asking for something different from them.\nMaybe they value Brick highly, since they offered 10 Brick at the beginning for 10 Sheep and 5 Ore.\nLet's try to get more Ore, which is your highest value resource. You could also try to get more Wood, as its value is decent and you have 17 of them.\n\nLet's try to offer a resource with a lower value for a resource with a higher value, ensuring the offer is balanced enough that Player 0 might accept.\nMaybe offering Brick for Ore makes sense. You have 22 Brick, and its value is 22.\n\nHow about offering something that gives you a higher total value?\n5 Sheep (16*5 = 80) for 3 Ore (38*3 = 114). The value difference is 34 in your favor. This is why Player 0 rejected it.\n\nLet's try to make a more balanced offer, but still in your favor.\nWhat if you offer a quantity of sheep for a quantity of ore, but with a smaller value gap?\nFor instance, 4 Sheep (4*16 = 64) for 2 Ore (2*38 = 76). This is a difference of 12 in your favor. This seems more reasonable.\n\nLet's also consider what Player 0 wanted earlier: 10 Brick and 5 Wheat for 10 Sheep and 5 Ore. This shows they want Sheep and Ore.\nYou have plenty of Sheep. You also have plenty of Brick.\n\nYou want to increase your total value. Ore is the highest value.\nWhat if you offer a combination of lower-value resources for a higher-value resource?\n\nLet's try offering a different lower-value resource, like Wheat, for something more valuable.\nYou have 19 Wheat (Value: 6).\nWhat if you offer a large quantity of Wheat for a small quantity of Ore?\nFor example, 10 Wheat (10*6 = 60) for 1 Ore (1*38 = 38). This is 60 -> 38, so in Player 0's favor. No.\n\nLet's try sticking with the Sheep for Ore trade, but make it more appealing to Player 0.\nOffer 5 Sheep (Value: 80) for 2 Ore (Value: 76). This is now in Player 0's favor by 4, but it could make them accept.\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
