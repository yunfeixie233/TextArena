      "response": "### Negotiation Game Initial Analysis\n\nAs Player 0, I will start by analyzing my current resources and their associated values:\n\n1. **[Wheat]**: Qty: 23, Value: 6\n2. **[Wood]**: Qty: 17, Value: 11\n3. **[Sheep]**: Qty: 12, Value: 15\n4. **[Brick]**: Qty: 14, Value: 28\n5. **[Ore]**: Qty: 16, Value: 39\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources through trades.\n\n### Initial Strategy\nTo maximize the total value, I should aim to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values if possible. Given the current values:\n- The highest value resource I have is **[Ore]** (Value: 39).\n- The lowest value resource I have is **[Wheat]** (Value: 6).\n\n### First Turn Analysis\nFor the first turn, I'll look for a potentially beneficial trade. Since **[Wheat]** has the lowest value, I'm inclined to offer some of it if I can get a resource of higher value in return.\n\n### Proposed Trade\nLet's examine potential trades. If I can trade **[Wheat]** for a resource with a higher value than 6, it would be beneficial. \n\nGiven the distribution of my resources, a potential trade could involve offering some **[Wheat]** for a resource that is not too abundant for me but is of higher value.\n\n### Trade Offer\nI'll start by offering 5 **[Wheat]** (total value = 5*6 = 30) for 1 **[Ore]** (total value = 1*39 = 39), as gaining **[Ore]** would slightly increase my total value, but since I already have **[Ore]**, let's think about other options.\n\nA more sensible trade would be to offer resources that are relatively lower in value for those that are higher. For instance, offering **[Wood]** (Value: 11) or **[Sheep]** (Value: 15) for **[Ore]** might not be as efficient as directly using **[Wheat]** or trying to get rid of the least valuable resource.\n\nLet's directly form an offer: \n`[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis trade offers:\n- 5 **[Wheat]** (Value: 5*6 = 30)\n- 1 **[Wood]** (Value: 1*11 = 11)\nTotal offered value = 30 + 11 = 41\nIn exchange for:\n- 1 **[Ore]** (Value: 1*39 = 39)\n\nThis is not a good trade for me as I'm losing value (41 > 39). Let's reconsider.\n\n### Reconsidering Trade\nLet's directly examine a more balanced or slightly favorable trade:\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nThis involves:\n- Giving up 4 **[Wheat]** (Value: 4*6 = 24)\n- Receiving 1 **[Sheep]** (Value: 1*15 = 15)\n\nThis isn't favorable as I'm still losing value (24 > 15).\n\nLet's adjust our strategy to make a more sensible trade.\n\n### Alternative Trade\nConsidering the resource values again and aiming for a more balanced trade, let's directly propose a trade that could be reasonable.\n\nLet's think about trading some **[Wheat]** for **[Brick]**, as **[Brick]** is of higher value than **[Wheat]** and **[Wood]**.\n\n### New Trade Offer\nLet's form a trade: \n`[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Brick]`\n\nThis involves:\n- Giving up 8 **[Wheat]** (Value: 8*6 = 48)\n- Receiving 2 **[Brick]** (Value: 2*28 = 56)\n\nThe total value received (56) is greater than the total value given up (48), making this a potentially beneficial trade.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n`[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Brick]`\n\nLet's wait for a response from the opponent.",

For example, offering 1 Wheat for 1 Wood isn't directly beneficial (6 for 11), but we need to consider the quantity.\n- Our previous offer of 4 Wheat for 1 Wood was rejected. Let's try a more favorable ratio.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a New Offer.\nLet's consider offering 2 Wheat for 1 Wood. This is a better ratio than before and still reasonable because we're giving up less value (2*6 = 12) to gain more (1*11 = 11). However, it's still not very favorable.\n\nA potentially more favorable trade could involve offering Sheep for Brick or Ore since Sheep are less valuable than Brick and Ore.\n\n## Step 4: Decide on a New Offer.\nLet's evaluate offering Sheep for Ore: 1 Sheep (Value: 15) for 1 Ore (Value: 39) is a good trade because we're gaining 39 - 15 = 24 in value.\n\nThus, a potential offer could be: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nLet's calculate the impact:\n- Giving up: 2 Sheep = 2*15 = 30\n- Receiving: 1 Ore = 1*39 = 39\n- Net gain: 39 - 30 = 9\n\nThis trade is beneficial.\n\nThe final action is: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "To make a decision for the next turn, let's first assess the current situation and the resources available.\n\nResources at hand:\n- Wheat: 23\n- Wood: 17\n- Sheep: 10 (since 2 were offered and accepted in the previous trade)\n- Brick: 14\n- Ore: 17 (since 1 was received in the previous trade)\n\nThe current total value = (23 * 6) + (17 * 11) + (10 * 15) + (14 * 28) + (17 * 39)\n= 138 + 187 + 150 + 392 + 663\n= 1530\n\nThe last trade involved offering 2 Sheep for 1 Ore. Let's analyze the last offer made by Player 1 and our response:\n- Player 1 offered 1 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Ore, which was rejected.\n- We then offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, which was accepted.\n- After that, we repeated the offer of 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, which was rejected.\n\nLet's examine the offer made by Player 1: 1 Wheat (Value: 6), 1 Wood (Value: 11) for 1 Ore (Value: 39). The total value offered is 17, and the requested value is 39. This is a significant gain for Player 1, which might be why we initially rejected it.\n\nOur last accepted trade was 2 Sheep (Value: 15 * 2 = 30) for 1 Ore (Value: 39), which is a gain of 9 in total value.\n\nFor the next turn, we need to consider making a trade that increases our total value. Let's analyze possible trades based on our resources and the last interactions:\n\n1. **Assess the last offer we made:** We offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, which was first accepted and then rejected upon repetition. This indicates that Player 1 might not be willing to continue the same trade.\n   \n2. **Evaluate potential trades:**\n   - We have plenty of Wheat and Wood. Offering some for higher-value resources like Ore could be beneficial.\n   - Our previous successful trade was 2 Sheep for 1 Ore. We could try different combinations but should consider the value.\n\n3. **New Offer:**\n   Let's consider offering some Wheat or Wood for Ore or Brick (since they are of higher value). For example, offering some Wheat for Wood or Brick, or Wood for Ore/Brick.\n\nLet's directly analyze and propose a new trade:\n- We could offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore (since Wood is less valuable than Ore, this could be a fair trade).\n  - Offered: 4 Wood (Value: 4 * 11 = 44)\n  - Requested: 1 Ore (Value: 39), this doesn't seem like a good trade for us.\n  \nAlternatively, let's think about what we can offer to gain more value:\n- Offer 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore\n  - Offered: (3 * 6) + (1 * 11) = 18 + 11 = 29\n  - Requested: 1 Ore = 39\n  This seems like a potentially acceptable trade as we're gaining value.\n\nGiven the format for making an offer: `[Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]`, let's construct it.\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThe final response is: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]`.",
