      "response": "Let me first restate what we just observed:\n\nPrevious turn outcomes  \n- They keep refusing every offer I make that gives them Wheat/Wood in exchange for Brick (three straight rejections).  \n- The two concrete offers they *sent* to me ask:  \n  \u2013 their Offer 1: 3 Sheep + 2 Ore  \u279c 5 Brick + 2 Sheep (I already denied it).  \n  \u2013 their Offer 2: 5 Wheat + 5 Wood \u279c 3 Brick + 1 Ore (still on the table).  \n\nTheir pattern is clear: they refuse to *give up* Brick/Ore unless they are getting Brick and/or Ore back (see Offer 1) or at least Wood (Offer 2). Wheat alone does not interest them.  \n\nKey observations  \n1. Their Offers specify receiving *at least as many* Ore or Brick as they part with.  \n2. I value Brick and Ore very highly (30 / 34 per unit), but Brick is the easier one for me right now because:  \n   \u2013 I have 15 Brick, so I can *spare* a few, whereas I only have 6 Ore.  \n3. They are stingy on brick/ore and reckless on sheep and wheat/wood, so if I want more brick or ore I must package something that *they* value.  \n\nDecision logic  \nI want to maximize my *total value*, and my Brick:Ore ratio is currently 15 : 6 which is ~2.5 : 1.  \nA slight reduction in Brick (10 or 12 -> 11) yields ~-30 points but might let me gain Ore (34) or improve some other mix.\n\nLet me try a two-pronged strategy  \nA. Get their Ore for less Brick than market value while still acceptable to them.  \nB. Offer a combined package where they still see \u201cgain\u201d on their Brick/Ore count, but I get the higher-valued Ore.\n\nMy counter-offer  \nI accept nothing I have seen so far *without modification*.  I will turn their Offer 2 into a more balanced trade that still leaves me ahead:\n\n[Deny]\n\n[Offer: 4 Brick -> 3 Ore]\n\nNet value change for me:  \n- Give away 4 Brick \u2192 -120  \n- Gain 3 Ore     \u2192 +102  \nNet for me \u2248 -18, but Brick count only drops from 15\u219211, Ore rises from 6\u21929, which in the bigger picture improves my Ore:Brick ratio from 6/15 \u2192 9/11.\n\nIf they counter with anything like \u201c3 Brick for 1 Ore\u201d I will adjust, but this is my opening reply.",

      "response": "I need more ore without giving away too much of my spare brick. I rejected 5 Brick \u2192 6 Ore because that would cost me 150 value (5\u00d730) to gain 204 value (6\u00d734)\u2014a net loss of 6 Ore minus the remaining Brick.  \n\nThe current ledger is:\n\nWheat 14 (84), Wood 24 (264), Sheep 24 (312), Brick 11 (330), Ore 9 (306) \u2014 total 1296.\n\nOre\u2019s marginal value to me is higher than Brick\u2019s, but not by a 6-to-5 margin. I do, however, have plenty of Sheep and Wheat I could convert if Player 1 would accept them. Let me try a new package that maximizes my net gain if accepted.\n\nThe last offer from P1 was symmetric to my rejected one, so continuing to reciprocate likely won\u2019t help. Instead, I\u2019ll probe for a better conversion rate.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 4 Ore]",
