Ore is also high. Sheep and Wood are lower.\nI want to increase my valuable resource totals. My Sheep count is low. I have a lot of Wheat and Brick.\n\nLet's offer some Wheat and Brick for some Sheep and Ore.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (5 * 6) + (3 * 26) = 30 + 78 = 108\nValue requested: (2 * 18) + (1 * 36) = 36 + 36 = 72\nThis is a bad offer for me.\n\nLet's consolidate. Maybe trade some high valued resources to get even more valuable resources?\nNo, the goal is to increase total value, so selling high value for higher value when I already have a significant amount of high value isn't ideal.\nI want to make sure I am trading away resources that I have a lot of and gaining resources that give me a better total value.\n\nMy current focus will be on trading away Wheat and Wood, and acquiring Sheep and Ore.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Brick.\nLet's offer some Wheat and Wood for Ore.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]\nValue offered: (5 * 6) + (5 * 10) = 30 + 50 = 80\nValue requested: (2 * 36) = 72\nThis is still losing value.\n\nI should try to make an offer that is beneficial to me. So my requested value should be higher than my offered value.\nLet's try to get resources that I have less of, like Wood and Sheep.\nI have plenty of Brick and Ore.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore]\nValue offered: (5 * 26) = 130\nValue requested: (2 * 36) = 72\nThis is bad.\n\nLet's focus on offloading Wheat and Wood.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 3 Sheep]\nValue offered: (5 * 6) + (3 * 10) = 30 + 30 = 60\nValue requested: (3 * 18) = 54\nStill losing value.\n\nOkay, let's try to gain more value with a higher number of requested items.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 4 Sheep]\nValue offered: (5 * 6) + (3 * 10) = 30 + 30 = 60\nValue requested: (4 * 18) = 72\nThis is a good trade for me, gaining 12 value. I will offer this.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 4 Sheep]",
