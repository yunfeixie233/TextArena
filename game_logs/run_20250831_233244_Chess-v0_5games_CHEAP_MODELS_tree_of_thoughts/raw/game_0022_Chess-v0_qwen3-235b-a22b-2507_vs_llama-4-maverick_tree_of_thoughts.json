      "response": "[Expert Panel Discussion]\n\n**Tactical Expert:**  \nThe position is the starting position of a standard chess game. There are no immediate tactical threats, captures, or checks. Every piece is on its starting square, and Black has not made a move yet. At this stage, no forcing sequence (like a fork, pin, or discovered attack) is available. I see no tactical blow White can deliver immediately. My evaluation is that this is a purely strategic opening phase. I\u2019ll defer to the positional expert for guidance on optimal development.\n\n**Positional Expert:**  \nWe are in the opening phase with full material and symmetrical pawn structure. The priority is rapid and harmonious development: activating minor pieces, controlling the center, and ensuring king safety. The best moves support central influence \u2014 either by occupying or pressuring the central squares (d4, d5, e4, e5). From White\u2019s perspective, the most principled opening moves are:\n- [e2e4] \u2013 occupation of e4, opening lines for queen and bishop\n- [d2d4] \u2013 occupation of d4, supporting a classical center\n- [g1f3] \u2013 developing the knight toward the center, preparing kingside castling\n\nThese moves are all strong, but statistically and historically, [e2e4] and [d2d4] lead the most common and effective opening systems. Since both are equally valid, I recommend one of them.\n\n**Endgame Expert:**  \nThis is the starting position. The game is nowhere near the endgame yet. My insights won\u2019t be valuable until much later \u2014 perhaps 30+ moves from now. I\u2019ll step back and let the others guide the opening. I\u2019ll return when pawns start promoting or when king activity becomes critical.\n\n[Tactical Expert] (interjecting):  \nWhile there\u2019s no tactic *now*, we must consider the direction of the game. [e2e4] opens lines for both the queen and the light-squared bishop. It immediately stakes a strong claim in the center and allows flexible follow-ups like [Ng1f3], [Bf1c4], or [Bf1b5], depending on Black\u2019s response. This move maximizes piece activity early.\n\n[Positional Expert]:  \nAgreed. [e2e4] is optimal not just for immediate central control, but for its influence on the entire trajectory of the game. It leads to open games with dynamic potential, where White can rapidly develop and launch initiative. It also avoids passive structures that might arise from weaker moves like [a2a3] or [h2h3].\n\n[Tactical Expert]:  \nMoreover, [e2e4] prevents Black from comfortably playing ...e5 on their first move, as we\u2019ll already control that square. It\u2019s both proactive and assertive.\n\n[Positional Expert]:  \nNo structural downsides. The pawn is supported by the queen and can later be reinforced with [Ng1f3]. It\u2019s a rock-solid foundation.\n\n[Both experts concur: [e2e4] is the best move.]\n\n[Endgame Expert]:  \nStill watching. Over to you.\n\n[Move selected]\n\n[e2e4]",

      "response": "### Expert Analysis\n\n**Tactical Expert:**  \nThe current position is a result of White playing [e2e4]. Black now has the opportunity to respond. There's no immediate tactical threat from White that we need to address urgently, but we should consider moves that challenge White's central control and develop our pieces. Playing [e7e5] directly challenges the pawn on e4 and opens up lines for our pieces. It's a solid, classical response.\n\n**Positional Expert:**  \nAgreed. [e7e5] is a principled move, fighting for central control and allowing for the development of our pieces. It mirrors White's strategy and maintains symmetry. Other options like [e7e6] or [d7d6] are also valid but are slightly more passive. [e7e5] is active and equalizes the central tension immediately.\n\n**Endgame Expert:**  \nWhile we're still far from the endgame, it's worth noting that the structure resulting from [e7e5] could lead to open lines and dynamic play. This might favor the player who better manages their piece development and coordination. I'll continue to observe, but it seems the initial moves are setting up a complex and open position.\n\n### Collaborative Insight\n\n[Tactical Expert]:  \nLet's consider other reasonable responses. [g8f6] is a good alternative, developing the knight and preparing to control the center. However, it doesn't directly challenge [e4].\n\n[Positional Expert]:  \nTrue. [g8f6] is a solid move, but it doesn't contest the center as directly as [e7e5]. Both are good, but [e7e5] fits better with the principle of challenging White's central pawn.\n\n[Tactical Expert]:  \nWe should also note that [e7e5] might lead to some sharp lines if White decides to challenge it with [d2d4]. However, that's a risk we're willing to take for the benefit of central control and piece development.\n\n[Positional Expert]:  \nThe consensus is that [e7e5] is a strong, active move. It equalizes the game and sets the stage for further development.\n\n### Move Selection\n\nGiven the expert analysis, the best move is [e7e5].\n\n[e7e5]\n\n### UCI Format Move\n\n[e7e5]",
