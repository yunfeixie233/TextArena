There are no forced captures or checkmating patterns available in one or two moves. All pieces are on their home squares, and Black has not made any weakening moves yet. Therefore, there are no tactical shots like forks, pins, or discovered attacks available at this moment.

In the starting position, our goals are to control the center, develop minor pieces, and prepare for kingside castling. The central squares (d4, d5, e4, e5) are critical. Moving a pawn to e4 or d4 immediately stakes a claim in the center and opens diagonals for the queen and bishop. The move e2-e4 has the added benefit of freeing both the queen and the light-squared bishop, contributing to rapid development. This aligns with classical opening principles: occupy the center and develop actively.\n\n[Expert 3 \u2013 Endgame Expert]  \nAt this stage, we're far from any endgame, but I can confirm that pawn structure integrity is still fully intact. No pawn moves have been made, so we must be cautious not to create early weaknesses.
