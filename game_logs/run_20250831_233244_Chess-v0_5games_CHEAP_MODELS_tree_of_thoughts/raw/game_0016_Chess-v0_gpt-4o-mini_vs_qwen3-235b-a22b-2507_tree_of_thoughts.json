      "response": "### Expert Analysis\n\n**Tactical Expert:**\nWith White playing [e2e4], the center is now contested. Black must respond carefully to avoid falling into common traps like the **Philidor Defense** or **Scandinavian pitfalls**. However, there is an immediate tactical opportunity: **[e7e5]** strikes back in the center, challenging White's pawn and opening diagonals for the queen and bishop. It\u2019s a symmetrical response that avoids weaknesses and maintains balance. Alternatively, [d7d5] could strike immediately in the center, but it allows exd5, opening the position prematurely without development.\n\n**Positional Expert:**\nPositionally, symmetry is acceptable here. Playing **[e7e5]** supports central control and mirrors White\u2019s ambitions. It activates the f8-bishop and queen, enabling quick kingside development. We maintain a solid pawn structure, and the central tension remains dynamic rather than one-sided. Moves like [c7c5] (accelerated Dragon setup) or [d7d6] (Pirc setup) are playable but slower and allow White more space. We should aim for quick, natural development. **[e7e5]** achieves this best.\n\n**Endgame Expert:**\nThough far from the endgame, the central pawn structure we lay now matters. A symmetrical e5 vs e4 setup offers balanced endgame prospects with chances for both sides. By not creating early weaknesses (like isolated or backward pawns), we preserve flexibility. The **[e7e5]** move keeps pawn symmetry and avoids early structural damage. It's also a foundation for many classical endgames like Ruy Lopez structures, which favor well-prepared players.\n\n### Collaborative Analysis\nAll experts agree: **[e7e5]** is the most principled and balanced move. It matches White\u2019s central advance, develops piece activity, avoids structural weaknesses, and keeps the game flexible for both tactical and strategic play ahead. While alternatives exist, none offer the same harmonious balance.\n\n### Move Decision\nFollowing unified expert consensus:\n[e7e5]",

      "response": "Apologies for the error. I mistakenly submitted White's move instead of Black's. I will now correct this and play a valid move for Black in the current position.\n\n### Expert Analysis\n\n**Tactical Expert:**  \nWhite has played [e2e4], advancing the king's pawn to claim the center. Black can respond directly with [e7e5], challenging the center and opening lines for the queen and kingside bishop. This is a direct and tactical counter-strike, maintaining symmetry and balance. It avoids passive setups and prevents White from gaining undue central dominance early.\n\n**Positional Expert:**  \nPlaying [e7e5] is also the most positionally sound choice. It supports immediate piece development, particularly the f8-bishop and queen, and adheres to classical opening principles: control the center with pawns and develop pieces harmoniously. Alternative moves like [c7c5] (Sicilian setup) or [e7e6] (French) are viable but either delay central counterplay or create asymmetry that may favor White\u2019s established central presence.\n\n**Endgame Expert:**  \nFrom a long-term structural viewpoint, [e7e5] maintains pawn symmetry and avoids weaknesses such as isolated or backward pawns. This leads to balanced endgame potential later. While endgames are distant, starting with a solid and flexible structure gives Black better transformation opportunities in the late middlegame.\n\n### Collaborative Analysis  \nAll experts agree: **[e7e5]** is the optimal reply. It is consistent with opening principles, increases activity, and keeps the position balanced yet dynamic. No flaws in this analysis are detected.\n\n### Move Decision  \nFollowing unified expert consensus:\n[e7e5]",
