There's no immediate tactical threat from White, so I focus on developing and challenging the center.\n\n#### Expert 2: Positional Analyst\nI evaluate the pawn structure and long-term plans. White's [e2e4] aims to dominate the center and facilitate quick development. To counter this, Black should also fight for central control and develop their pieces harmoniously. [e7e5] is a direct response, challenging White's central pawn. Alternatively, [d7d5] or [c7c5] can also contest the center.

The choice between these moves influences the pawn structure and potential endgame scenarios.
