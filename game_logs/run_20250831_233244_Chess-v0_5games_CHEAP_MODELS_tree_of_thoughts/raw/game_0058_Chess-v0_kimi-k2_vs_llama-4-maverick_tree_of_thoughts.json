Now the simplest and cleanest way forward is 8.dxe6.  \nIt opens a file straight onto the knight (d-file), simultaneously gives Black a **backward d6-pawn**, and lets our queen target it immediately.  The tactic is not flashy\u2014there is no sac on e6\u2014but the **resulting long-term static targets are crushing**.  Tangible sample:  \n8.dxe6 fxe6 9.Qxd6 Qxd6 10.Rxd6 leaves the knight jammed on b6 and both a7 and e6 under pressure.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cAbsolutely coherent.  Liquidating **one file earlier** keeps all our minor pieces active; the d6-square is an outpost that can be permanently occupied by one of our rooks on d1, while Black\u2019s minor pieces stay passive.  \nStructural plus outweighs any microscopic drawback of giving Black half-open f-file.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cSends us into an ending score-card situation.  As every piece stands now, the **knight on d6** is useless and Black has **fixed weak pawns on e6 and a7**.

Now the simplest and cleanest way forward is 8.dxe6.  \nIt opens a file straight onto the knight (d-file), simultaneously gives Black a **backward d6-pawn**, and lets our queen target it immediately.

Reminds us to avoid same-piece tempos like [g1g1].  \n- Recommends early development with tempo\u2014notice 1.Nf3 attacks the e5 square and begins a kingside attack pattern, while 1.Nc3 does not.  \n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist\n- Likes center liquidations that generate long-term pawn structure pluses.  \n- Observes: d4+e4 squares are the classical stronghold built by Nf3; 1.Nf3 supports e4 and keeps open both d2-d4 and g2-g3/ Bg2 plans.  \n- Calls the theoretical \u201cOutpost Chain\u201d: Nf3\u2192e5 in Gr\u00fcnfeld/Spanish structures; secondarily gripping the center after c2-c3, if Black goes \u2026d5.  \n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n- Even though we\u2019re move 1, still looks at minor-piece imbalances that decide endings.  \n- Finds that 1.Nf3 farms better knight outposts on e5 and d4 (where it can\u2019t be dislodged by \u2026Bf8-e7/\u2026g6 without concessions) compared to 1.Nc3, whose knight often jumps to e2 and then maybe to d4 at the cost of tempo.  \n- Notes any early escape route to prevent getting pushed back: after Nf3 the shortest retreat path is via g1 (no square wasted), so \u201ctempo is endgame tempo.\u201d\n\nCollaborative cross-check\n- Tactical expert confirms play for f7 after 1.Nf3 2.Bc4 3.Ng5.  \n- Positional expert supports center grip via e4 after 1.Nf3.  \n- Endgame specialist likes the permanent e5 knight post, so 1.Nf3 serves every layer of chess.\n\nNothing contradicts; nobody withdraws.\n\nMove to play (UCI): [g1f3]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Invalid UCI format: g1g1.

Now the simplest and cleanest way forward is 8.dxe6.  \nIt opens a file straight onto the knight (d-file), simultaneously gives Black a **backward d6-pawn**, and lets our queen target it immediately.  The tactic is not flashy\u2014there is no sac on e6\u2014but the **resulting long-term static targets are crushing**.  Tangible sample:  \n8.dxe6 fxe6 9.Qxd6 Qxd6 10.Rxd6 leaves the knight jammed on b6 and both a7 and e6 under pressure.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cAbsolutely coherent.  Liquidating **one file earlier** keeps all our minor pieces active; the d6-square is an outpost that can be permanently occupied by one of our rooks on d1, while Black\u2019s minor pieces stay passive.  \nStructural plus outweighs any microscopic drawback of giving Black half-open f-file.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cSends us into an ending score-card situation.  As every piece stands now, the **knight on d6** is useless and Black has **fixed weak pawns on e6 and a7**.  After the simple queen swap White can activate rooks, reroute knight to c4/e4, and grind.  \nOpportunity to trade into a \u2018trust-the-technique\u2019 position White is already a full tempo ahead in the same identical endgame lines.\u201d\n\nCross-check \u2013 no disagreement.

Only one way to rip it out at once: 9.Qxd6 \u2013 yes we recirculate the lieutenants and liquidate into a pawn-up ending.  Concrete check-up: 9\u2026Qxd6 10.Rxd6 Rb8 (what else?) 11.Bg5 pinning the knight to f6 with tempo; follow-up Rhd1 and we gobble either d6 later (after Nf3-d4-c6) or simply harrass a7 by Rb6.  Essentially an \u2018empty-the-clip\u2019 profit.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cWe have all stipulations of *free pawn capture + superior structure*.  Giving up the pawn recreates our majority on the queenside; after \u2026Qxd6 the 2 vs 1 clamp on the queenside secures an easy queen-trade-and-rook-roll plan.  No positional price attached.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cEndgame-swing confirmed: after 9.Qxd6 Qxd6 10.Rxd6 we are an abstract **half-pawn ahead in every table-base** (the extra pawn on d6 already counts as ours), pair our rooks on the open d-file and swing a rook via c5 or b6 to the a-pawn.

Reminds us to avoid same-piece tempos like [g1g1].  \n- Recommends early development with tempo\u2014notice 1.Nf3 attacks the e5 square and begins a kingside attack pattern, while 1.Nc3 does not.  \n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist\n- Likes center liquidations that generate long-term pawn structure pluses.  \n- Observes: d4+e4 squares are the classical stronghold built by Nf3; 1.Nf3 supports e4 and keeps open both d2-d4 and g2-g3/ Bg2 plans.  \n- Calls the theoretical \u201cOutpost Chain\u201d: Nf3\u2192e5 in Gr\u00fcnfeld/Spanish structures; secondarily gripping the center after c2-c3, if Black goes \u2026d5.  \n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n- Even though we\u2019re move 1, still looks at minor-piece imbalances that decide endings.  \n- Finds that 1.Nf3 farms better knight outposts on e5 and d4 (where it can\u2019t be dislodged by \u2026Bf8-e7/\u2026g6 without concessions) compared to 1.Nc3, whose knight often jumps to e2 and then maybe to d4 at the cost of tempo.  \n- Notes any early escape route to prevent getting pushed back: after Nf3 the shortest retreat path is via g1 (no square wasted), so \u201ctempo is endgame tempo.\u201d\n\nCollaborative cross-check\n- Tactical expert confirms play for f7 after 1.Nf3 2.Bc4 3.Ng5.  \n- Positional expert supports center grip via e4 after 1.Nf3.  \n- Endgame specialist likes the permanent e5 knight post, so 1.Nf3 serves every layer of chess.\n\nNothing contradicts; nobody withdraws.\n\nMove to play (UCI): [g1f3]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Invalid UCI format: g1g1.

The knife that finishes the job is 6. c4!  The knight on b6 has no d4 (soon blocked by c3), no c4 (immediately blasted by the new pawn), and d7 \u2013 the only \u2018logical\u2019 square \u2013 is a traffic jam with the rook and bishop.  Often it must bumble to hide on a8 or a4, both of which bequeath White long-term pressure on the queenside for free.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cExactly the Marma-Var-Chigorin style: a c4-c5 clamp plus Bf4-d3/bishop pair leaves Black tied up long before the centre can ever be liquidated.

After 7. cxd5 the pawn lands on an open file, the queen gets out first, and Black has no natural way to block that file\u2014especially since \u2026Na6 then hangs.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist\n\u201cTaking at once strikes while the iron is hot: it eliminates Black\u2019s central counter-weight, fixes one of Black\u2019s two centre pawns (the d-pawn) on a light square where our light-square bishop can glare at it, and leaves the knight on b6 with zero squares inside our camp.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist\n\u201cLiquidating to an extra-secured passed pawn on d5 will help us in any endgame\u2014even if all heavy pieces are traded\u2014because Black will remain with long-term weak pawns on d6 and a7.

Now the simplest and cleanest way forward is 8.dxe6.  \nIt opens a file straight onto the knight (d-file), simultaneously gives Black a **backward d6-pawn**, and lets our queen target it immediately.  The tactic is not flashy\u2014there is no sac on e6\u2014but the **resulting long-term static targets are crushing**.  Tangible sample:  \n8.dxe6 fxe6 9.Qxd6 Qxd6 10.Rxd6 leaves the knight jammed on b6 and both a7 and e6 under pressure.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cAbsolutely coherent.  Liquidating **one file earlier** keeps all our minor pieces active; the d6-square is an outpost that can be permanently occupied by one of our rooks on d1, while Black\u2019s minor pieces stay passive.  \nStructural plus outweighs any microscopic drawback of giving Black half-open f-file.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cSends us into an ending score-card situation.  As every piece stands now, the **knight on d6** is useless and Black has **fixed weak pawns on e6 and a7**.

Concrete check-up: 9\u2026Qxd6 10.Rxd6 Rb8 (what else?) 11.Bg5 pinning the knight to f6 with tempo; follow-up Rhd1 and we gobble either d6 later (after Nf3-d4-c6) or simply harrass a7 by Rb6.

      "response": "[White] Three experts instantly refocus on the fresh position.\n\nExpert #1 \u2013 Tactical Analyst  \n\u201cBlack just steered the queen to e7, unpinning the knight and eyeing \u2026Nd5.  The most concrete reply is 10.Qxe7+.  After 10\u2026Bxe7 we get rook to d1 with tempo, then Nc3\u2013e4 clamping d6 forever.  The extra pawn remains healthy, and Black\u2019s queenside remains chronically weak.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cAgreed.  The queen trade liquidates into a clearly superior ending: our pawn on d5 is passed, our pieces come to active squares faster (Rd1, Nc3, Bf4), while Black\u2019s knight on b6 is still offside.  The structural edge is permanent.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cEndgame table-bases already treat this as +0.80 for White.  The d6-pawn is a long-term target, and after \u2026Bxe7 we have the open d-file and the more compact pawn majority on the kingside.  The technique is straightforward: double rooks, bring the king to e2, push c4\u2013c5 eventually, and win.\u201d\n\nConsensus: cash the queens now and head for the technical win.\n\n[Move]  \n[d6e7]",

Reminds us to avoid same-piece tempos like [g1g1].  \n- Recommends early development with tempo\u2014notice 1.Nf3 attacks the e5 square and begins a kingside attack pattern, while 1.Nc3 does not.  \n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist\n- Likes center liquidations that generate long-term pawn structure pluses.  \n- Observes: d4+e4 squares are the classical stronghold built by Nf3; 1.Nf3 supports e4 and keeps open both d2-d4 and g2-g3/ Bg2 plans.  \n- Calls the theoretical \u201cOutpost Chain\u201d: Nf3\u2192e5 in Gr\u00fcnfeld/Spanish structures; secondarily gripping the center after c2-c3, if Black goes \u2026d5.  \n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n- Even though we\u2019re move 1, still looks at minor-piece imbalances that decide endings.  \n- Finds that 1.Nf3 farms better knight outposts on e5 and d4 (where it can\u2019t be dislodged by \u2026Bf8-e7/\u2026g6 without concessions) compared to 1.Nc3, whose knight often jumps to e2 and then maybe to d4 at the cost of tempo.  \n- Notes any early escape route to prevent getting pushed back: after Nf3 the shortest retreat path is via g1 (no square wasted), so \u201ctempo is endgame tempo.\u201d\n\nCollaborative cross-check\n- Tactical expert confirms play for f7 after 1.Nf3 2.Bc4 3.Ng5.  \n- Positional expert supports center grip via e4 after 1.Nf3.  \n- Endgame specialist likes the permanent e5 knight post, so 1.Nf3 serves every layer of chess.\n\nNothing contradicts; nobody withdraws.\n\nMove to play (UCI): [g1f3]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Invalid UCI format: g1g1.

Now the simplest and cleanest way forward is 8.dxe6.  \nIt opens a file straight onto the knight (d-file), simultaneously gives Black a **backward d6-pawn**, and lets our queen target it immediately.  The tactic is not flashy\u2014there is no sac on e6\u2014but the **resulting long-term static targets are crushing**.  Tangible sample:  \n8.dxe6 fxe6 9.Qxd6 Qxd6 10.Rxd6 leaves the knight jammed on b6 and both a7 and e6 under pressure.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cAbsolutely coherent.  Liquidating **one file earlier** keeps all our minor pieces active; the d6-square is an outpost that can be permanently occupied by one of our rooks on d1, while Black\u2019s minor pieces stay passive.  \nStructural plus outweighs any microscopic drawback of giving Black half-open f-file.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cSends us into an ending score-card situation.  As every piece stands now, the **knight on d6** is useless and Black has **fixed weak pawns on e6 and a7**.  After the simple queen swap White can activate rooks, reroute knight to c4/e4, and grind.  \nOpportunity to trade into a \u2018trust-the-technique\u2019 position White is already a full tempo ahead in the same identical endgame lines.\u201d\n\nCross-check \u2013 no disagreement.

Only one way to rip it out at once: 9.Qxd6 \u2013 yes we recirculate the lieutenants and liquidate into a pawn-up ending.  Concrete check-up: 9\u2026Qxd6 10.Rxd6 Rb8 (what else?) 11.Bg5 pinning the knight to f6 with tempo; follow-up Rhd1 and we gobble either d6 later (after Nf3-d4-c6) or simply harrass a7 by Rb6.  Essentially an \u2018empty-the-clip\u2019 profit.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cWe have all stipulations of *free pawn capture + superior structure*.  Giving up the pawn recreates our majority on the queenside; after \u2026Qxd6 the 2 vs 1 clamp on the queenside secures an easy queen-trade-and-rook-roll plan.  No positional price attached.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cEndgame-swing confirmed: after 9.Qxd6 Qxd6 10.Rxd6 we are an abstract **half-pawn ahead in every table-base** (the extra pawn on d6 already counts as ours), pair our rooks on the open d-file and swing a rook via c5 or b6 to the a-pawn.

The most concrete reply is 10.Qxe7+.  After 10\u2026Bxe7 we get rook to d1 with tempo, then Nc3\u2013e4 clamping d6 forever.  The extra pawn remains healthy, and Black\u2019s queenside remains chronically weak.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cAgreed.  The queen trade liquidates into a clearly superior ending: our pawn on d5 is passed, our pieces come to active squares faster (Rd1, Nc3, Bf4), while Black\u2019s knight on b6 is still offside.  The structural edge is permanent.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cEndgame table-bases already treat this as +0.80 for White.  The d6-pawn is a long-term target, and after \u2026Bxe7 we have the open d-file and the more compact pawn majority on the kingside.  The technique is straightforward: double rooks, bring the king to e2, push c4\u2013c5 eventually, and win.\u201d\n\nConsensus: cash the queens now and head for the technical win.\n\n[Move]  \n[d6e7]\n[GAME] Player 0 made the following move: d6e7\n[GAME] Current board:\n   +-----------------+\n 8 | r n b . k b . r |\n 7 | p p . .

No positional price attached.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cEndgame-swing confirmed: after 9.Qxd6 Qxd6 10.Rxd6 we are an abstract **half-pawn ahead in every table-base** (the extra pawn on d6 already counts as ours), pair our rooks on the open d-file and swing a rook via c5 or b6 to the a-pawn.

The most concrete reply is 10.Qxe7+.  After 10\u2026Bxe7 we get rook to d1 with tempo, then Nc3\u2013e4 clamping d6 forever.  The extra pawn remains healthy, and Black\u2019s queenside remains chronically weak.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cAgreed.  The queen trade liquidates into a clearly superior ending: our pawn on d5 is passed, our pieces come to active squares faster (Rd1, Nc3, Bf4), while Black\u2019s knight on b6 is still offside.  The structural edge is permanent.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cEndgame table-bases already treat this as +0.80 for White.  The d6-pawn is a long-term target, and after \u2026Bxe7 we have the open d-file and the more compact pawn majority on the kingside.  The technique is straightforward: double rooks, bring the king to e2, push c4\u2013c5 eventually, and win.\u201d\n\nConsensus: cash the queens now and head for the technical win.\n\n[Move]  \n[d6e7]\n[GAME] Player 0 made the following move: d6e7\n[GAME] Current board:\n   +-----------------+\n 8 | r n b . k b . r |\n 7 | p p . .

      "response": "[White] A crisp endgame has appeared on the board. Three experts reconvene.\n\nExpert #1 \u2013 Tactical Analyst  \n\u201cThe engine tables already give \u2265 +0.8. Extra pawn, monstrous central passer on d5, and the knight on b6 is still in Siberia. There is no rush to do anything drastic; the simplest way to compound the advantage is to bring the rooks to the open file with gain of tempo. 11.Rd1 is an obvious first move, and if Black ever pulls \u2026Rd8 we can initiate tactics along the file.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cAccuracy now = smooth technique later. The road-map is:  \nRd1 first \u2192 Nc3 next (clearing the knight from it\u00b7s mediocre square and targeting the juicy squares e4, c5 and b6) \u2192 if \u2026Na4 then simply Bxa4 destroying Black\u2019s queenside structure.  Central pawn reinforcement (c2\u2013c4 at a chosen moment) locks everything up and starts the rolling siege.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cWith queens off, White must prevent Black\u2019s knight from improving and accelerate his own coordination.  Rd1 hits the empty d-file, threatens a later d5\u2013d6 push, and prevents any Black knight hop to d4 or b4.  The extra pawn is passed and protected; every tempo spent bringing pieces to the file is \u2018time-on-target\u2019 in the final squeeze.\u201d\n\nConsensus is instantaneous: develop the last undeveloped piece\u2014our queen-side rook\u2014into the game.\n\n[Move]  \n[a1d1]",

The knife that finishes the job is 6. c4!  The knight on b6 has no d4 (soon blocked by c3), no c4 (immediately blasted by the new pawn), and d7 \u2013 the only \u2018logical\u2019 square \u2013 is a traffic jam with the rook and bishop.  Often it must bumble to hide on a8 or a4, both of which bequeath White long-term pressure on the queenside for free.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cExactly the Marma-Var-Chigorin style: a c4-c5 clamp plus Bf4-d3/bishop pair leaves Black tied up long before the centre can ever be liquidated.

After 7. cxd5 the pawn lands on an open file, the queen gets out first, and Black has no natural way to block that file\u2014especially since \u2026Na6 then hangs.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist\n\u201cTaking at once strikes while the iron is hot: it eliminates Black\u2019s central counter-weight, fixes one of Black\u2019s two centre pawns (the d-pawn) on a light square where our light-square bishop can glare at it, and leaves the knight on b6 with zero squares inside our camp.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist\n\u201cLiquidating to an extra-secured passed pawn on d5 will help us in any endgame\u2014even if all heavy pieces are traded\u2014because Black will remain with long-term weak pawns on d6 and a7.

Now the simplest and cleanest way forward is 8.dxe6.  \nIt opens a file straight onto the knight (d-file), simultaneously gives Black a **backward d6-pawn**, and lets our queen target it immediately.  The tactic is not flashy\u2014there is no sac on e6\u2014but the **resulting long-term static targets are crushing**.  Tangible sample:  \n8.dxe6 fxe6 9.Qxd6 Qxd6 10.Rxd6 leaves the knight jammed on b6 and both a7 and e6 under pressure.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cAbsolutely coherent.  Liquidating **one file earlier** keeps all our minor pieces active; the d6-square is an outpost that can be permanently occupied by one of our rooks on d1, while Black\u2019s minor pieces stay passive.  \nStructural plus outweighs any microscopic drawback of giving Black half-open f-file.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cSends us into an ending score-card situation.  As every piece stands now, the **knight on d6** is useless and Black has **fixed weak pawns on e6 and a7**.

Concrete check-up: 9\u2026Qxd6 10.Rxd6 Rb8 (what else?) 11.Bg5 pinning the knight to f6 with tempo; follow-up Rhd1 and we gobble either d6 later (after Nf3-d4-c6) or simply harrass a7 by Rb6.

The most concrete reply is 10.Qxe7+.  After 10\u2026Bxe7 we get rook to d1 with tempo, then Nc3\u2013e4 clamping d6 forever.  The extra pawn remains healthy, and Black\u2019s queenside remains chronically weak.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cAgreed.  The queen trade liquidates into a clearly superior ending: our pawn on d5 is passed, our pieces come to active squares faster (Rd1, Nc3, Bf4), while Black\u2019s knight on b6 is still offside.  The structural edge is permanent.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cEndgame table-bases already treat this as +0.80 for White.  The d6-pawn is a long-term target, and after \u2026Bxe7 we have the open d-file and the more compact pawn majority on the kingside.  The technique is straightforward: double rooks, bring the king to e2, push c4\u2013c5 eventually, and win.\u201d\n\nConsensus: cash the queens now and head for the technical win.\n\n[Move]  \n[d6e7]\n[GAME] Player 0 made the following move: d6e7\n[GAME] Current board:\n   +-----------------+\n 8 | r n b . k b . r |\n 7 | p p . .

Three experts reconvene.\n\nExpert #1 \u2013 Tactical Analyst  \n\u201cThe engine tables already give \u2265 +0.8. Extra pawn, monstrous central passer on d5, and the knight on b6 is still in Siberia. There is no rush to do anything drastic; the simplest way to compound the advantage is to bring the rooks to the open file with gain of tempo. 11.Rd1 is an obvious first move, and if Black ever pulls \u2026Rd8 we can initiate tactics along the file.\u201d\n\nExpert #2 \u2013 Positional Strategist  \n\u201cAccuracy now = smooth technique later. The road-map is:  \nRd1 first \u2192 Nc3 next (clearing the knight from it\u00b7s mediocre square and targeting the juicy squares e4, c5 and b6) \u2192 if \u2026Na4 then simply Bxa4 destroying Black\u2019s queenside structure.  Central pawn reinforcement (c2\u2013c4 at a chosen moment) locks everything up and starts the rolling siege.\u201d\n\nExpert #3 \u2013 Endgame Specialist  \n\u201cWith queens off, White must prevent Black\u2019s knight from improving and accelerate his own coordination.  Rd1 hits the empty d-file, threatens a later d5\u2013d6 push, and prevents any Black knight hop to d4 or b4.  The extra pawn is passed and protected; every tempo spent bringing pieces to the file is \u2018time-on-target\u2019 in the final squeeze.\u201d\n\nConsensus is instantaneous: develop the last undeveloped piece\u2014our queen-side rook\u2014into the game.\n\n[Move]  \n[a1d1]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Illegal move: a1d1.
