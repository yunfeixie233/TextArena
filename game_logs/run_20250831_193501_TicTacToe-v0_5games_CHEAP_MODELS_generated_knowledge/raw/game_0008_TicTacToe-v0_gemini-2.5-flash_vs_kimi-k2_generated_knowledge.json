This is a common and strong response.\n\nMy immediate strategic priorities are:\n1.  **Maintain offensive potential**: While X's move at 8 doesn't directly threaten a win for X, it creates potential lines (row 8-8, column 2-8). I need to ensure my next move continues to build my own winning opportunities.\n2.  **Counter corner strategy**: Placing X in a corner implies a common strategy to try and create a fork. I need to be aware of this and potentially block X's future two-way threats.\n3.  **Prioritize corners directly opposite X's move or an adjacent non-corner**:\n    *   **Opposite corner (0)**: Taking the corner opposite X's current corner (8) is a strong defensive move as it denies X a straight diagonal win. It also sets up my own diagonal line. This is a very common and strong second move for O when X takes a corner.\n    *   **Adjacent non-corner (2 or 6)**: Taking an edge adjacent to X's corner could also be considered, but it doesn't create as many immediate threats as taking an opposite corner.\n    *   **Other corners (2, 6)**: Taking a different corner would also be strong, but 0 is usually prioritized due to the symmetrical opposition.\n\nConsidering the common strategies, taking the opposite corner (0) is generally the most robust move at this stage, setting up my own diagonal threat while pre-emptively blocking X's.\n\n[0]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] [Generate Knowledge:  \nOpponent O currently owns the center (4) and the top-left corner (0), giving them a diagonal threat from 0\u20134\u20138 which is still incomplete.

Immediate threat check \u2013 O has no row/column/diagonal that is one move away from completing three, so no single square I must block instantly.\n2. Fork/Offensive opportunity for me \u2013 If I can pick a square that creates two non-blocked two-in-a-row lines simultaneously, I force O to give up a win on the next move. The classic fork on this board would attack the \u201cO-O-X\u201d diagonal in two places simultaneously.\n3. Prime corners left: 2 and 6 are the remaining corners. Placing X in corner 2 would threaten 2\u20135\u20138 and 0\u20132\u2013(next diagonal). More importantly, 2 also lies on the threatened long diagonal 0\u20134\u20138; if I play 2, I am one move from completing two different potential winning lines (row 2\u20135\u20138 and diagonal 0\u20132\u20138), which is a deadly fork that cannot both be blocked.\n\nThus, 2 is the move that both defuses the opponent\u2019s building pressure on the diagonal and sets up an unstoppable fork.\n\n2]\n[GAME] Player 1 attempted an invalid move.
