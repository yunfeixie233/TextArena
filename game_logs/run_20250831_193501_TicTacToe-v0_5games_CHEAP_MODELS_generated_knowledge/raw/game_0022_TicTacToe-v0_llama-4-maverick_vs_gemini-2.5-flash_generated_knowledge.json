While not an immediate win yet, 'O' is building towards a win. There is no immediate 'O' win to block on this move.\n    *   **Creating Forks/Multiple Threats**: My primary goal now is to create a situation where I can win on the next move or create two simultaneous threats that 'O' cannot block.\n    *   **Avoiding \"O\" Forks**: It's crucial not to place my 'X' in a spot that allows 'O' to create a fork on their next move.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Available Moves and Their Implications**:\n    *   **Corners (2, 6)**:\n        *   If I play in `2`: This creates a potential line (0-?-2) and (2-O-?) as well as a diagonal (0-O-8).\n        *   If I play in `6`: This creates a potential line (0-?-6) and (6-O-?) as well as a diagonal (X-O-O). This also sets up a potential line with the existing X at 0.\n        *   Playing in an empty corner (2 or 6) is a strong move at this stage, as it puts another 'X' on a major line.\n\n    *   **Edges (1, 3, 5, 7)**:\n        *   `1`: Creates 0-1-? line.\n        *   `3`: Creates 0-3-? line.\n        *   `5`: Creates ?-O-5 line.\n        *   `7`: Creates ?-O-7 line.\n        *   Playing an edge can be good for setting up future plays, but they are generally less powerful than corner moves for setting up forks from this specific board state.\n\n4.  **Optimal Strategy (Creating a Fork)**:\n    *   'O' has played center (4) and opposite corner (8). This specific setup means that if 'X' plays in the remaining *empty corner* on the *same diagonal* as their first move (i.e., if I played 0, and now play 2), 'X' can create a fork.\n    *   Let's check playing in `2`:\n        *   This creates a potential win on row 0-1-2.\n        *   This creates a potential win on column 2-5-?.\n        *   This creates a diagonal with `O` at `4`.\n    *   Let's check playing in `6`:\n        *   This creates a potential win on column 0-3-6.\n        *   This creates a potential win on row 6-7-8.\n        *   This is the *other* empty corner. This is strategically equivalent to '2' in this situation from a 'fork' perspective, as it creates an \"X-O-X\" diagonal.\n\n    *   For Player 'X' to set up a win, the best strategy is to take one of the two remaining corner spots (2 or 6). This makes a diagonal line of X-O-X, and creates an immediate threat for the next turn. If I place 'X' in 2, I have a potential win along 0-blank-2, and also 2-blank-O. If the opponent doesn't block correctly, I can win. This specific strategy is called 'building a fork'.\n\n5.  **Re-evaluating the \"Opposite Corner\" strategy for 'O' and my response**: 'O' playing in 8 (opposite corner) after I played 0, with 'O' in 4 (center), is a common response. To create a fork, 'X' needs to play in one of the *other* two corners (2 or 6). Either corner (2 or 6) allows 'X' to create two possible winning lines on the next turn, creating a \"fork\" effect.\n\n    Let's pick 2.\n\nMove Decision: [2]",

Key strategies include:\n   - **Controlling the Center**: The center square (4) is the most important square because it provides the most flexibility for the next move and is part of multiple potential winning lines. Thus, playing in the center is generally considered a strong opening move.\n   - **Corner Strategy**: Corners (0, 2, 6, 8) are the next most valuable as they provide an opportunity to create a fork (a situation where you could win in two different ways) more easily than edges.\n   - **Edges**: Edges (1, 3, 5, 7) are less preferred for the first move unless it's a response to an opponent's move that necessitates playing there to block a potential win.\n\n2. **Defensive Priorities**: Initially, defense is about not allowing your opponent to get a strong foothold. As the game progresses, it becomes about blocking their winning lines.\n   - Blocking an opponent's potential three in a row is crucial.\n\n3. **Offensive Patterns**: As 'O', creating multiple threats simultaneously (a \"fork\") is a powerful strategy to win.\n   - Playing in the center or corners can facilitate creating a fork.\n\n4. **Endgame Tactics**: Not directly applicable here since the game has just started.\n\n### Applying the Knowledge to the Current Situation\n\nGiven the board is empty and it's the first move, we need to apply the opening strategy. The best first move is to control the center of the board, which is position 4. This gives 'O' (Player 0) the greatest flexibility for the next move and puts pressure on 'X' to respond in a way that counters 'O's potential strategies.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is to place 'O' in position 4.\n\n### Move Decision\n\nThe move is: `[4]`\n\nSo, after making this move, the board will look like this:\n\n```\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n```\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] Generate Knowledge: As Player 1 ('X'), my opponent ('O') has just played in the center (4). This is a strong opening move for them. My strategic considerations now shift to responding effectively.\n\n1.  **Opening Strategy (Responding to Center)**: When the opponent takes the center, the best responses for Player 1 ('X') are typically:\n    *   **Taking a Corner (0, 2, 6, 8)**: This is generally considered the strongest response. It forces the opponent to play defensively or risk setting up a fork for 'X'. Corners are good because they are part of three potential winning lines. Playing in a corner creates immediate diagonal threats if O tries to expand centrally.\n    *   **Taking an Edge (1, 3, 5, 7)**: While not as strong as a corner, an edge can still be a viable response if it creates a threat or sets up a future play. However, it's generally less flexible than a corner.\n\n2.  **Defensive Priorities**: At this stage, there's no immediate threat from 'O' that needs blocking, as they only have one piece on the board. The defense is about preventing them from setting up an easy win later.\n\n3.  **Offensive Patterns**: My goal is to create my own winning lines or set up a fork. By taking a corner, I immediately create a diagonal line with the center 'O'. This forces 'O' to consider blocking that line or risk opening up a path for 'X'.\n\n4.  **Endgame Tactics**: Still not applicable.\n\nApplying the Knowledge: My opponent has played in the center (4). The optimal response for 'X' is to take a corner. All corners (0, 2, 6, 8) are equally good in this initial scenario as they offer the same strategic benefits. I will choose corner 0.\n\nMove Decision: [0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] ### Generating Knowledge\n\n1. **Current State Analysis**: The current board state is:\n\n   ```\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n   ```\n\n   'X' has taken corner 0, and 'O' has taken the center (4).\n\n2. **Responding to 'X' in Corner 0**: Given 'X' has taken a corner, 'O's next move should consider both defensive and offensive strategies.\n\n3. **Key Strategic Considerations**:\n   - **Maintaining Flexibility**: 'O' should maintain or increase flexibility for the next move.\n   - **Corner Response**: When 'X' takes a corner, a strong response for 'O' is to take the opposite corner. This maintains the potential for creating a fork and counters 'X's diagonal threat.\n   - **Edges and Other Corners**: Depending on the situation, taking an edge or another corner might be viable. However, taking the opposite corner is generally more strategic.\n\n4. **Applying the Knowledge**:\n   - The opposite corner of 0 is 8. So, 'O' should consider playing in position 8.\n\n5. **Defensive and Offensive Considerations**:\n   - Playing in 8 doesn't directly block any immediate threat from 'X' but sets up 'O' for potential future plays and maintains the balance.\n\n### Move Decision\n\n'Playing in the corner opposite to 'X' is a good strategy. Therefore, 'O' will be placed in position 8.\n\nThe move is: `[8]`\n\nAfter making this move, the board will look like this:\n\n```\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n```\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  Generate Knowledge:\n\n1.  **Current Board State Assessment**:\n    *   'X' (me) has cell 0.\n    *   'O' (opponent) has cells 4 (center) and 8 (opposite corner).\n    *   This current configuration (X-O-O along a diagonal) sets up a specific type of game, often leading to a draw if both players play optimally, but also presents opportunities for forks if the opponent makes a mistake.\n\n    ```\n    X | 1 | 2\n    ---+---+---\n    3 | O | 5\n    ---+---+---\n    6 | 7 | O\n    ```\n\n2.  **Strategic Priorities for Player 'X' (My Turn)**:\n    *   **Blocking \"O\"**: 'O' has set up a diagonal line (4, 8) with the center. While not an immediate win yet, 'O' is building towards a win. There is no immediate 'O' win to block on this move.\n    *   **Creating Forks/Multiple Threats**: My primary goal now is to create a situation where I can win on the next move or create two simultaneous threats that 'O' cannot block.\n    *   **Avoiding \"O\" Forks**: It's crucial not to place my 'X' in a spot that allows 'O' to create a fork on their next move.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Available Moves and Their Implications**:\n    *   **Corners (2, 6)**:\n        *   If I play in `2`: This creates a potential line (0-?-2) and (2-O-?) as well as a diagonal (0-O-8).\n        *   If I play in `6`: This creates a potential line (0-?-6) and (6-O-?) as well as a diagonal (X-O-O). This also sets up a potential line with the existing X at 0.\n        *   Playing in an empty corner (2 or 6) is a strong move at this stage, as it puts another 'X' on a major line.\n\n    *   **Edges (1, 3, 5, 7)**:\n        *   `1`: Creates 0-1-? line.\n        *   `3`: Creates 0-3-? line.\n        *   `5`: Creates ?-O-5 line.\n        *   `7`: Creates ?-O-7 line.\n        *   Playing an edge can be good for setting up future plays, but they are generally less powerful than corner moves for setting up forks from this specific board state.\n\n4.  **Optimal Strategy (Creating a Fork)**:\n    *   'O' has played center (4) and opposite corner (8). This specific setup means that if 'X' plays in the remaining *empty corner* on the *same diagonal* as their first move (i.e., if I played 0, and now play 2), 'X' can create a fork.\n    *   Let's check playing in `2`:\n        *   This creates a potential win on row 0-1-2.\n        *   This creates a potential win on column 2-5-?.\n        *   This creates a diagonal with `O` at `4`.\n    *   Let's check playing in `6`:\n        *   This creates a potential win on column 0-3-6.\n        *   This creates a potential win on row 6-7-8.\n        *   This is the *other* empty corner. This is strategically equivalent to '2' in this situation from a 'fork' perspective, as it creates an \"X-O-X\" diagonal.\n\n    *   For Player 'X' to set up a win, the best strategy is to take one of the two remaining corner spots (2 or 6). This makes a diagonal line of X-O-X, and creates an immediate threat for the next turn. If I place 'X' in 2, I have a potential win along 0-blank-2, and also 2-blank-O. If the opponent doesn't block correctly, I can win. This specific strategy is called 'building a fork'.\n\n5.  **Re-evaluating the \"Opposite Corner\" strategy for 'O' and my response**: 'O' playing in 8 (opposite corner) after I played 0, with 'O' in 4 (center), is a common response. To create a fork, 'X' needs to play in one of the *other* two corners (2 or 6). Either corner (2 or 6) allows 'X' to create two possible winning lines on the next turn, creating a \"fork\" effect.\n\n    Let's pick 2.\n\nMove Decision: [2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'",

Consider aspects like:\n- Opening strategy (center vs corners vs edges)\n- Defensive priorities (when and what to block)\n- Offensive patterns (how to create forks and multiple threats)\n- Endgame tactics (forcing wins or draws)\n\nAfter generating this knowledge, apply it to make your move decision.\n\nFormat your move as '[number]' where number is 0-8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To tackle this Tic Tac Toe game effectively, let's first generate relevant knowledge about the game's strategy, particularly focusing on the current state of the board.\n\n### Current Board State\n\nThe board is empty:\n\n```\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n```\n\nAvailable moves are all positions on the board.\n\n### Generating Knowledge\n\n1. **Opening Strategy**: The opening is crucial in Tic Tac Toe. Key strategies include:\n   - **Controlling the Center**: The center square (4) is the most important square because it provides the most flexibility for the next move and is part of multiple potential winning lines. Thus, playing in the center is generally considered a strong opening move.\n   - **Corner Strategy**: Corners (0, 2, 6, 8) are the next most valuable as they provide an opportunity to create a fork (a situation where you could win in two different ways) more easily than edges.\n   - **Edges**: Edges (1, 3, 5, 7) are less preferred for the first move unless it's a response to an opponent's move that necessitates playing there to block a potential win.\n\n2. **Defensive Priorities**: Initially, defense is about not allowing your opponent to get a strong foothold. As the game progresses, it becomes about blocking their winning lines.\n   - Blocking an opponent's potential three in a row is crucial.\n\n3. **Offensive Patterns**: As 'O', creating multiple threats simultaneously (a \"fork\") is a powerful strategy to win.\n   - Playing in the center or corners can facilitate creating a fork.\n\n4. **Endgame Tactics**: Not directly applicable here since the game has just started.\n\n### Applying the Knowledge to the Current Situation\n\nGiven the board is empty and it's the first move, we need to apply the opening strategy. The best first move is to control the center of the board, which is position 4. This gives 'O' (Player 0) the greatest flexibility for the next move and puts pressure on 'X' to respond in a way that counters 'O's potential strategies.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is to place 'O' in position 4.\n\n### Move Decision\n\nThe move is: `[4]`\n\nSo, after making this move, the board will look like this:\n\n```\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n```\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] Generate Knowledge: As Player 1 ('X'), my opponent ('O') has just played in the center (4). This is a strong opening move for them. My strategic considerations now shift to responding effectively.\n\n1.  **Opening Strategy (Responding to Center)**: When the opponent takes the center, the best responses for Player 1 ('X') are typically:\n    *   **Taking a Corner (0, 2, 6, 8)**: This is generally considered the strongest response. It forces the opponent to play defensively or risk setting up a fork for 'X'. Corners are good because they are part of three potential winning lines. Playing in a corner creates immediate diagonal threats if O tries to expand centrally.\n    *   **Taking an Edge (1, 3, 5, 7)**: While not as strong as a corner, an edge can still be a viable response if it creates a threat or sets up a future play. However, it's generally less flexible than a corner.\n\n2.  **Defensive Priorities**: At this stage, there's no immediate threat from 'O' that needs blocking, as they only have one piece on the board. The defense is about preventing them from setting up an easy win later.\n\n3.  **Offensive Patterns**: My goal is to create my own winning lines or set up a fork. By taking a corner, I immediately create a diagonal line with the center 'O'. This forces 'O' to consider blocking that line or risk opening up a path for 'X'.\n\n4.  **Endgame Tactics**: Still not applicable.\n\nApplying the Knowledge: My opponent has played in the center (4). The optimal response for 'X' is to take a corner. All corners (0, 2, 6, 8) are equally good in this initial scenario as they offer the same strategic benefits. I will choose corner 0.\n\nMove Decision: [0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] ### Generating Knowledge\n\n1. **Current State Analysis**: The current board state is:\n\n   ```\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n   ```\n\n   'X' has taken corner 0, and 'O' has taken the center (4).\n\n2. **Responding to 'X' in Corner 0**: Given 'X' has taken a corner, 'O's next move should consider both defensive and offensive strategies.\n\n3. **Key Strategic Considerations**:\n   - **Maintaining Flexibility**: 'O' should maintain or increase flexibility for the next move.\n   - **Corner Response**: When 'X' takes a corner, a strong response for 'O' is to take the opposite corner. This maintains the potential for creating a fork and counters 'X's diagonal threat.\n   - **Edges and Other Corners**: Depending on the situation, taking an edge or another corner might be viable. However, taking the opposite corner is generally more strategic.\n\n4. **Applying the Knowledge**:\n   - The opposite corner of 0 is 8. So, 'O' should consider playing in position 8.\n\n5. **Defensive and Offensive Considerations**:\n   - Playing in 8 doesn't directly block any immediate threat from 'X' but sets up 'O' for potential future plays and maintains the balance.\n\n### Move Decision\n\n'Playing in the corner opposite to 'X' is a good strategy. Therefore, 'O' will be placed in position 8.\n\nThe move is: `[8]`\n\nAfter making this move, the board will look like this:\n\n```\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n```\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  Generate Knowledge:\n\n1.  **Current Board State Assessment**:\n    *   'X' (me) has cell 0.\n    *   'O' (opponent) has cells 4 (center) and 8 (opposite corner).\n    *   This current configuration (X-O-O along a diagonal) sets up a specific type of game, often leading to a draw if both players play optimally, but also presents opportunities for forks if the opponent makes a mistake.\n\n    ```\n    X | 1 | 2\n    ---+---+---\n    3 | O | 5\n    ---+---+---\n    6 | 7 | O\n    ```\n\n2.  **Strategic Priorities for Player 'X' (My Turn)**:\n    *   **Blocking \"O\"**: 'O' has set up a diagonal line (4, 8) with the center. While not an immediate win yet, 'O' is building towards a win. There is no immediate 'O' win to block on this move.\n    *   **Creating Forks/Multiple Threats**: My primary goal now is to create a situation where I can win on the next move or create two simultaneous threats that 'O' cannot block.\n    *   **Avoiding \"O\" Forks**: It's crucial not to place my 'X' in a spot that allows 'O' to create a fork on their next move.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Available Moves and Their Implications**:\n    *   **Corners (2, 6)**:\n        *   If I play in `2`: This creates a potential line (0-?-2) and (2-O-?) as well as a diagonal (0-O-8).\n        *   If I play in `6`: This creates a potential line (0-?-6) and (6-O-?) as well as a diagonal (X-O-O). This also sets up a potential line with the existing X at 0.\n        *   Playing in an empty corner (2 or 6) is a strong move at this stage, as it puts another 'X' on a major line.\n\n    *   **Edges (1, 3, 5, 7)**:\n        *   `1`: Creates 0-1-? line.\n        *   `3`: Creates 0-3-? line.\n        *   `5`: Creates ?-O-5 line.\n        *   `7`: Creates ?-O-7 line.\n        *   Playing an edge can be good for setting up future plays, but they are generally less powerful than corner moves for setting up forks from this specific board state.\n\n4.  **Optimal Strategy (Creating a Fork)**:\n    *   'O' has played center (4) and opposite corner (8). This specific setup means that if 'X' plays in the remaining *empty corner* on the *same diagonal* as their first move (i.e., if I played 0, and now play 2), 'X' can create a fork.\n    *   Let's check playing in `2`:\n        *   This creates a potential win on row 0-1-2.\n        *   This creates a potential win on column 2-5-?.\n        *   This creates a diagonal with `O` at `4`.\n    *   Let's check playing in `6`:\n        *   This creates a potential win on column 0-3-6.\n        *   This creates a potential win on row 6-7-8.\n        *   This is the *other* empty corner. This is strategically equivalent to '2' in this situation from a 'fork' perspective, as it creates an \"X-O-X\" diagonal.\n\n    *   For Player 'X' to set up a win, the best strategy is to take one of the two remaining corner spots (2 or 6). This makes a diagonal line of X-O-X, and creates an immediate threat for the next turn. If I place 'X' in 2, I have a potential win along 0-blank-2, and also 2-blank-O. If the opponent doesn't block correctly, I can win. This specific strategy is called 'building a fork'.\n\n5.  **Re-evaluating the \"Opposite Corner\" strategy for 'O' and my response**: 'O' playing in 8 (opposite corner) after I played 0, with 'O' in 4 (center), is a common response. To create a fork, 'X' needs to play in one of the *other* two corners (2 or 6). Either corner (2 or 6) allows 'X' to create two possible winning lines on the next turn, creating a \"fork\" effect.\n\n    Let's pick 2.\n\nMove Decision: [2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] ### Generating Knowledge\n\n1. **Current Board State**:\n   ```\n   X | 1 | X \n   ---+---+---\n   3 | O | 5 \n   ---+---+---\n   6 | 7 | O \n   ```\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - 'X' has taken corners 0 and 2.\n   - 'O' has taken the center (4) and corner 8.\n\n3. **Strategic Considerations for 'O'**:\n   - 'X' has created a potential threat along the top row (0-1-2) and diagonals are partially occupied.\n   - 'O' needs to block 'X's potential winning line on the top row (0-1-2) by playing in position 1.\n\n4. **Key Strategic Priorities**:\n   - **Blocking 'X's Winning Line**: 'X' has two corners (0 and 2), so 'O' must play in position 1 to block the potential win on the top row.\n   - **Maintaining Defensive Posture**: By blocking 'X's immediate threat, 'O' maintains a defensive posture.\n\n5. **Applying the Knowledge**:\n   - The best move for 'O' is to block 'X's potential win by taking position 1.\n\n### Move Decision\n\n'Playing in position 1 will block 'X's potential three in a row on the top row.\n\nThe move is: `[1]`\n\nAfter making this move, the board will look like this:\n\n```\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n```\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] Generate Knowledge:\n\n1.  **Current Board State Assessment**:\n    *   'X' (me) has cells 0 and 2.\n    *   'O' (opponent) has cells 1, 4, and 8.\n    *   'O' has blocked my top row (0-1-2).\n    *   The board now looks like this:\n        ```\n        X | O | X\n        ---+---+---\n        3 | O | 5\n        ---+---+---\n        6 | 7 | O\n        ```\n\n2.  **Strategic Priorities for Player 'X' (My Turn)**:\n    *   **Offensive Patterns - Creating Forks**: 'O' has already blocked one potential win.
