Non-adjacent to position 5 are corners 0 and 6 (adjacent would be 2 and 8).  \n\n3. **Fork Setup Potential**:  \n   - Taking corner 0 (top-left) creates two immediate threats:  \n     - **Main diagonal** (0-4-8): Controllable with one more move.  \n     - **Row 0** (0-1-2) or **Column 0** (0-3-6): Opens paths for future forks.  \n   - If opponent blocks the diagonal (e.g., by taking 8), Player 0 can play 2 next for a fork: threatening **row 0** (via 0-1-2) and **anti-diagonal** (via 2-4-6).  \n\n4. **Defensive Neutralization**:  \n   - Opponent's edge move at 5 weakens col2 but doesn't threaten active win lines. Ignore col2\u2014focus on developing uncontested diagonals/rows.  \n\n### Move Decision  \nOptimal move: **Position 0 (top-left corner)**. As a non-adjacent corner to X's edge play, it maximizes board control, sets up fork opportunities, and pressures opponent X to respond defensively.  \n\n**[0]**\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] ### Generated Knowledge for Tic Tac Toe Strategy (After Player 0's Move)\n\n1. **Assessing Board State**:  \n   - After Player 0 (O) placed their mark in position 0, they now have two O's in positions 0 and 4. They're one move away from a win if they manage to occupy position 3. \n\n2. **Immediate Threats**:  \n   - I must prioritize blocking Player 0 from winning on their next turn. The only immediate threat is their potential to win in the left column by placing an O in position 3.\n\n3. **Blocking Strategy**:  \n   - Position 3 should be blocked as it allows Player 0 to create a vertical line in the left column. Therefore, placing 'X' in position 3 must be my next move.\n\n4. **Future Move Considerations**:  \n   - After blocking Player 0, I can look for opportunities in the future, including potentially controlling positions that can help create forks or multiple threats.\n\n### Move Decision  \nTo block Player 0 from completing their winning line, I will place 'X' in **position 3**.\n\n**[3]**  \n Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 3.  \n Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2  \n---+---+---  \n X | O | X  \n---+---+---  \n 6 | 7 | 8  \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'",

Playing position 8 wins instantly.  \n   - **Critical insight**: Always prioritize a winning move when available\u2014it ends the game immediately.  \n\n2. **Opponent Threat Assessment**:  \n   - Player 1 (X) has no immediate threats:  \n     - Their marks (3 and 5) are in the middle row (blocked by O at 4) and lack aligned pairs.  \n     - No row/column/diagonal has two X\u2019s, so no blocking urgency.  \n\n3. **Alternative Move Risks**:  \n   - If ignoring position 8:  \n     - Playing corners (6) or edges (1,2,7) forfeits the win and allows X to block/force a draw.  \n     - Position 8 is the **only** move that guarantees victory.  \n\n4. **Endgame Principle**:  \n   - When a winning line is open, exploit it immediately\u2014delaying risks opponent counterplay.  \n\n### Move Decision  \nOptimal move: **Position 8 (bottom-right corner)**.
