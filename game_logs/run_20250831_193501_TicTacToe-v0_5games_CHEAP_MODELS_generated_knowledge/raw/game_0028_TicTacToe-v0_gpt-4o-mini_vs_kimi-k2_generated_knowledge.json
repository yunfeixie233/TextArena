Consider aspects like:\n- Opening strategy (center vs corners vs edges)\n- Defensive priorities (when and what to block)\n- Offensive patterns (how to create forks and multiple threats)\n- Endgame tactics (forcing wins or draws)\n\nAfter generating this knowledge, apply it to make your move decision.\n\nFormat your move as '[number]' where number is 0-8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] ### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn Tic Tac Toe, the following key principles and strategies are important:\n\n1. **Opening Strategy**:\n   - The center (position 4) is the most advantageous position since it allows the most potential winning lines (four).\n   - Corners (positions 0, 2, 6, and 8) are also valuable, providing two potential winning lines.\n   - Edges (positions 1, 3, 5, and 7) are the least valuable as they provide only one potential winning line.\n\n2. **Defensive Priorities**:\n   - Always block your opponent (X) from winning. If they have two in a row, place your 'O' in the open spot to block.\n   - Be aware of potential forks; if X can set up two winning opportunities in their next turn, you must block one.\n\n3. **Offensive Patterns**:\n   - Try to create forks where you can have two winning opportunities simultaneously.\n   - Work towards setting up two 'O's in a row while creating a scenario where you can win on your next turn regardless of what X plays.\n\n4. **Endgame Tactics**:\n   - The aim is to create a scenario where your moves force a win or at least a draw if you cannot win.\n   - If the game allows only draws, make your moves to ensure no further threats can be established by X.\n\n### Current Situation Analysis\n\nCurrently, the board is empty:\n```\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n```\nAll moves are available, and since it's the opening move, the strategy will lean towards taking a center or corner position.\n\nGiven these principles and considering it's my first move, I will take the center position (4) for optimal play.\n\n### Decision\n\nI will make my move to position [4].\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1]  ### Generate Knowledge\n\n**Key principles now that the center (4) is taken by O:**\n\n1. Strategic priorities with center already occupied:\n   - Against a center-first-move, the best classical reply is to take a corner. Corners retain multiple winning lines, and their exploitation is more viable when center is taken.\n   - Corner positions (0, 2, 6, 8) are slightly favorable over edges because they simultaneously create two potential lines apiece and force the symmetric lines to be defended.\n   - Edges (1, 3, 5, 7) are weaker because they only influence one of the eight possible 3-in-a-row lines.\n\n2. Fork and Threat Analysis:\n   - O attempted the central expansion; an immediate corner creates symmetrical and fork-like reply to central defenses.  \n   - With center occupied, choosing a corner prevents opponent\u2019s simple corner-opposite pairing advantage, and it positions to build diagonals or row control early.\n\n3. Symmetry and Game Tree:\n   - Without committing to a side, choosing either corner 0, 2, 6, or 8 produces equivalent game states under 2D board symmetry.  \n   - There is no tactical difference among the four corners yet; any are equally viable relative to branching possibilities.\n\n4. Defensive Cast:\n   - Current configuration has no immediate threats. Thus, no blocking required yet. Focus purely on maximizing positional advantage.\n\n### Applying to Current Position\n\nThe empty center (4) is taken by O. Per theory, best reply is to seize a corner.

Next turn, 3 or 8 later would fork.  \n   - Other corners (8) or edges (3,5) don\u2019t presently fork as strongly.\n\n4. **Decision hierarchy**\n   - Highest priority: block opponent win \u2192 occupy the cell that immediately stops col1 (cell 7).  \n   - Secondary: if no block required, create most threatening corner; but the block is mandatory here.\n\n### Applying knowledge\n\nThe only square that prevents O from winning on the next turn is [7].  \nThat move also fills the remaining square in col1, eliminating that lane for X.\n\n### Decision\n\n[7]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] ### Generate Knowledge\n\nCurrent position:  \n```\n X | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | 8 \n```\n\nAs Player 0 (O), the following principles and strategies are relevant:\n\n1. **Defensive Priorities**:\n   - Player 1 (X) has just placed an 'X' in position 7, effectively blocking Player 0 from winning in column 1 on their next turn. There are no immediate threats of X winning in this turn, but I must carefully evaluate my next move.\n\n2. **Offensive Opportunities**:\n   - I need to look for ways to create my own winning opportunities. Row 1 is already populated with two 'O's, which opens the chance to win if I can place my 'O' in the open position 2. \n\n3. **Fork Analysis**:\n   - While I have no existing forks, placing 'O' in position 2 would secure a row win in the next turn, pressing for a victory while limiting X's opportunities on subsequent moves.\n\n4. **Strategic Move Selection**:\n   - Given the current configuration of the board, my immediate goal should be to move to position 2 to create a winning opportunity.\n\n### Current Situation Analysis\n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[8]'\n\n- Position 2 provides a direct winning move for me in the following turn, creating a horizontal line when considering my next turn.\n- Positions 3, 5, 6, and 8 do not present immediate winning threats or opportunities.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince placing my 'O' at position 2 sets me up for a victory on the subsequent turn while maximizing my offensive play, I will move there.\n\nDecision: [2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [### Generate Knowledge\nThe game is over.
