This isn't the most aggressive opening since they didn't choose the center, but it still exerts some influence.\n\n3. **Strategic Considerations:**\n   - **Maintaining Center Control:** Since I have the center, I should look to build on this advantage.\n   - **Corner Response:** The opponent has taken a corner. A good response is to play in a position that either supports a potential fork or prepares to develop other areas of the board.\n\n4. **Defensive Priorities:** Currently, there are no immediate threats from the opponent, so I don't need to prioritize blocking. However, I should be mindful of the potential for the opponent to create a fork or a strong line.\n\n5. **Offensive Patterns:** To create a strong position, I should look to occupy a corner or a position that allows for flexibility in my next moves. Playing in a corner adjacent to the occupied one can be a good strategy as it potentially allows for a fork.\n\n6. **Endgame Tactics:** While it's early in the game, setting up for potential endgame scenarios is crucial. I need to be aware of the available moves and potential lines of play for both myself and my opponent.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nGiven that I have control of the center and the opponent has taken one corner, a strategic move would be to take a corner that is not adjacent to their corner or is a good starting point for creating potential forks or lines. Corners 2, 6, or 8 are options.\n\nPlaying in position 2 (a corner adjacent to the center) could be a good move as it exerts influence and keeps options open for the next move. However, considering the opponent's 'O' in position 0, playing in a non-adjacent corner like 8 could be an interesting alternative. It doesn't directly confront their 'O' but starts to build a presence.\n\nLet's choose a corner that provides flexibility. Corner 8 is a good choice because it:\n- Is diagonally opposite to the opponent's corner, potentially setting up a diagonal line.\n- Keeps the board open for further development.\n\n**Moving to:** [8]\n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n```\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X\n```\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  **Knowledge Generation:**\n\n1. **Current State Analysis:** The board now looks like this:\n```\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X\n```\nI have 'O' in position 0, and Player 1 has 'X' in position 4 (the center) and position 8 (a corner).\n\n2. **Strategic Considerations:** Player 1 currently has one 'X' in the center which gives them significant influence over the board, while my 'O' is in a corner. My next move will require defensive and offensive strategies.\n\n3. **Defensive Priorities:** The opponent has two 'X's now, and while there\u2019s no immediate threat for a win on the next move, I must prepare for potential threats in the future. The center and position 8 are vital for Player 1.\n\n4. **Offensive Patterns:** I need to either block potential lines of 'X' for the opponent or create my own winning chance. Occupying position 1 or 2 would create opportunities for alignment subsequent to blocking the opponent.\n\n5. **Endgame Tactics:** If I can make a move that both blocks Player 1 from winning and creates a potential for my own alignment in the next turns, that would be beneficial. \n\n**Move Decision:**\nGiven that Player 1 currently occupies the center and a corner, my best offensive strategy is to take a position that not only blocks potential threats but also aims to build towards my win. If I place 'O' in position 1, I potentially set myself up for a vertical line in the next round without giving them an immediate winning move.\n\nI will place my 'O' in position 1.\n\n**Moving to:** [1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] **Knowledge Generation:**\n\n1. **Current State Analysis:** The current board state is:\n```\n O | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X\n```\nThe opponent has 'O' in positions 0 and 1, and I have 'X' in positions 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Response to Opponent's Move:** The opponent has now occupied two positions (0 and 1), indicating a potential push towards controlling the top row or creating a future threat. \n\n3. **Strategic Considerations:**\n   - **Addressing the Opponent's Threat:** The opponent is close to winning the top row. I need to consider blocking this potential win.\n   - **Maintaining Center Control and Building:** Since I control the center, my next move should either support my existing 'X' positions or address the opponent's growing presence.\n\n4. **Defensive Priorities:** The opponent is one move away from winning the top row. I must prioritize blocking their potential win by playing in position 2.\n\n5. **Offensive Patterns:** While defense is the immediate priority, I should also consider how my next move sets up future opportunities.\n\n6. **Endgame Tactics:** By blocking the opponent's potential win, I buy time to develop my own strategy further.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nTo block the opponent's potential three-in-a-row on the top, I need to play in position 2.

If I place 'O' in position 1, I potentially set myself up for a vertical line in the next round without giving them an immediate winning move.\n\nI will place my 'O' in position 1.\n\n**Moving to:** [1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] **Knowledge Generation:**\n\n1. **Current State Analysis:** The current board state is:\n```\n O | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X\n```\nThe opponent has 'O' in positions 0 and 1, and I have 'X' in positions 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Response to Opponent's Move:** The opponent has now occupied two positions (0 and 1), indicating a potential push towards controlling the top row or creating a future threat. \n\n3. **Strategic Considerations:**\n   - **Addressing the Opponent's Threat:** The opponent is close to winning the top row. I need to consider blocking this potential win.\n   - **Maintaining Center Control and Building:** Since I control the center, my next move should either support my existing 'X' positions or address the opponent's growing presence.\n\n4. **Defensive Priorities:** The opponent is one move away from winning the top row. I must prioritize blocking their potential win by playing in position 2.\n\n5. **Offensive Patterns:** While defense is the immediate priority, I should also consider how my next move sets up future opportunities.\n\n6. **Endgame Tactics:** By blocking the opponent's potential win, I buy time to develop my own strategy further.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nTo block the opponent's potential three-in-a-row on the top, I need to play in position 2.

I must block this by playing in position 6.\n\n3. **Maintaining Control:** By placing an 'O' in position 6, I will not only block Player 1's potential win but also set myself up to go for a win on my next turn by creating a vertical threat as well as connecting with my own 'O's.\n\n4. **Offensive Patterns:** Although my immediate priority is to block my opponent, I also need to start thinking about how to win. By occupying position 6, I could potentially create lines on the left side of the board for myself.\n\n5. **Endgame Tactics:** Blocking Player 1\u2019s winning move and simultaneously positioning myself for a potential winning move in my following turn is crucial.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nTo block Player 1's imminent win and also create an opportunity for myself, I will place 'O' in position 6.\n\n**Moving to:** [6] \n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n```\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X\n```\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] **Knowledge Generation:**\n\n1. **Current State Analysis:** The current board state is:\n```\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X\n```\nThe opponent has 'O' in positions 0, 1, and 6, and I have 'X' in positions 2, 4, and 8.\n\n2. **Response to Opponent's Move:** The opponent has blocked my potential win and created a strong presence on the board, especially on the left side and bottom left corner.\n\n3. **Strategic Considerations:**\n   - **Defensive Priorities:** The opponent has a strong presence, but there are no immediate threats that I need to block at this moment.\n   - **Offensive Patterns:** I need to look for opportunities to create a winning line. With 'X' in positions 2, 4, and 8, I should look to utilize the center and create a fork or align my 'X's.\n\n4. **Available Moves Analysis:** The available moves are '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', and '[7]'. \n   - Position 4 is already occupied by 'X', so it can't be used.\n   - Position 3 is available and could be a good move to create a potential line or fork.\n   - Position 5 is available and could support a potential win by creating a line or fork on the middle row or a diagonal if the opponent doesn't block effectively.\n   - Position 7 is available and could be useful in creating a line or supporting my existing 'X' in position 8.\n\n5. **Move Decision:**\nTo create a potential winning opportunity, I should analyze the available positions.

The center (position 4) is the most influential position because it allows access to the most lines (four potential wins). If the center is not available, corners are the next best option, as they allow for diagonal and vertical/horizontal alignment.\n\n2. **Defensive Priorities:** If the opponent has two in a row, blocking their winning move is a priority. This can happen in any direction: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Always be vigilant for immediate threats that could result in a loss if not addressed.\n\n3. **Offensive Patterns:** Creating forks\u2014situations where two non-blocked lines can win in the next move\u2014is vital for setting up a win. If I can create a scenario where my opponent can only block one potential winning move, I can secure my win on the next turn.\n\n4. **Endgame Tactics:** At the endgame, if there are no immediate winning moves, look for a way to either block the opponent or create opportunities that allow me multiple ways to win in subsequent turns. \n\n**Current Board State:**\n```\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8\n```\n**Available Moves:** '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n\n**Move Decision:**\nThe center (position 4) is currently available and is the optimal first move.

I need to consider the implications of the opponent's first move and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\n2. **Response to Opponent's Move:** The opponent has chosen to play in position 0, a corner. This isn't the most aggressive opening since they didn't choose the center, but it still exerts some influence.\n\n3. **Strategic Considerations:**\n   - **Maintaining Center Control:** Since I have the center, I should look to build on this advantage.\n   - **Corner Response:** The opponent has taken a corner. A good response is to play in a position that either supports a potential fork or prepares to develop other areas of the board.\n\n4. **Defensive Priorities:** Currently, there are no immediate threats from the opponent, so I don't need to prioritize blocking. However, I should be mindful of the potential for the opponent to create a fork or a strong line.\n\n5. **Offensive Patterns:** To create a strong position, I should look to occupy a corner or a position that allows for flexibility in my next moves. Playing in a corner adjacent to the occupied one can be a good strategy as it potentially allows for a fork.\n\n6. **Endgame Tactics:** While it's early in the game, setting up for potential endgame scenarios is crucial. I need to be aware of the available moves and potential lines of play for both myself and my opponent.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nGiven that I have control of the center and the opponent has taken one corner, a strategic move would be to take a corner that is not adjacent to their corner or is a good starting point for creating potential forks or lines. Corners 2, 6, or 8 are options.\n\nPlaying in position 2 (a corner adjacent to the center) could be a good move as it exerts influence and keeps options open for the next move. However, considering the opponent's 'O' in position 0, playing in a non-adjacent corner like 8 could be an interesting alternative. It doesn't directly confront their 'O' but starts to build a presence.\n\nLet's choose a corner that provides flexibility. Corner 8 is a good choice because it:\n- Is diagonally opposite to the opponent's corner, potentially setting up a diagonal line.\n- Keeps the board open for further development.\n\n**Moving to:** [8]\n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n```\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X\n```\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  **Knowledge Generation:**\n\n1. **Current State Analysis:** The board now looks like this:\n```\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X\n```\nI have 'O' in position 0, and Player 1 has 'X' in position 4 (the center) and position 8 (a corner).\n\n2. **Strategic Considerations:** Player 1 currently has one 'X' in the center which gives them significant influence over the board, while my 'O' is in a corner. My next move will require defensive and offensive strategies.\n\n3. **Defensive Priorities:** The opponent has two 'X's now, and while there\u2019s no immediate threat for a win on the next move, I must prepare for potential threats in the future. The center and position 8 are vital for Player 1.\n\n4. **Offensive Patterns:** I need to either block potential lines of 'X' for the opponent or create my own winning chance.

Playing in a corner adjacent to the occupied one can be a good strategy as it potentially allows for a fork.\n\n6. **Endgame Tactics:** While it's early in the game, setting up for potential endgame scenarios is crucial. I need to be aware of the available moves and potential lines of play for both myself and my opponent.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nGiven that I have control of the center and the opponent has taken one corner, a strategic move would be to take a corner that is not adjacent to their corner or is a good starting point for creating potential forks or lines. Corners 2, 6, or 8 are options.\n\nPlaying in position 2 (a corner adjacent to the center) could be a good move as it exerts influence and keeps options open for the next move. However, considering the opponent's 'O' in position 0, playing in a non-adjacent corner like 8 could be an interesting alternative. It doesn't directly confront their 'O' but starts to build a presence.\n\nLet's choose a corner that provides flexibility. Corner 8 is a good choice because it:\n- Is diagonally opposite to the opponent's corner, potentially setting up a diagonal line.\n- Keeps the board open for further development.\n\n**Moving to:** [8]\n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n```\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X\n```\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  **Knowledge Generation:**\n\n1. **Current State Analysis:** The board now looks like this:\n```\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X\n```\nI have 'O' in position 0, and Player 1 has 'X' in position 4 (the center) and position 8 (a corner).\n\n2. **Strategic Considerations:** Player 1 currently has one 'X' in the center which gives them significant influence over the board, while my 'O' is in a corner. My next move will require defensive and offensive strategies.\n\n3. **Defensive Priorities:** The opponent has two 'X's now, and while there\u2019s no immediate threat for a win on the next move, I must prepare for potential threats in the future. The center and position 8 are vital for Player 1.\n\n4. **Offensive Patterns:** I need to either block potential lines of 'X' for the opponent or create my own winning chance. Occupying position 1 or 2 would create opportunities for alignment subsequent to blocking the opponent.\n\n5. **Endgame Tactics:** If I can make a move that both blocks Player 1 from winning and creates a potential for my own alignment in the next turns, that would be beneficial. \n\n**Move Decision:**\nGiven that Player 1 currently occupies the center and a corner, my best offensive strategy is to take a position that not only blocks potential threats but also aims to build towards my win. If I place 'O' in position 1, I potentially set myself up for a vertical line in the next round without giving them an immediate winning move.\n\nI will place my 'O' in position 1.\n\n**Moving to:** [1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] **Knowledge Generation:**\n\n1. **Current State Analysis:** The current board state is:\n```\n O | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X\n```\nThe opponent has 'O' in positions 0 and 1, and I have 'X' in positions 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Response to Opponent's Move:** The opponent has now occupied two positions (0 and 1), indicating a potential push towards controlling the top row or creating a future threat. \n\n3. **Strategic Considerations:**\n   - **Addressing the Opponent's Threat:** The opponent is close to winning the top row. I need to consider blocking this potential win.\n   - **Maintaining Center Control and Building:** Since I control the center, my next move should either support my existing 'X' positions or address the opponent's growing presence.\n\n4. **Defensive Priorities:** The opponent is one move away from winning the top row. I must prioritize blocking their potential win by playing in position 2.\n\n5. **Offensive Patterns:** While defense is the immediate priority, I should also consider how my next move sets up future opportunities.\n\n6. **Endgame Tactics:** By blocking the opponent's potential win, I buy time to develop my own strategy further.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nTo block the opponent's potential three-in-a-row on the top, I need to play in position 2. This move is defensive but necessary to prevent their win.\n\n**Moving to:** [2]\n\nThis will result in the following board:\n```\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X\n```\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  **Knowledge Generation:**\n\n1. **Current State Analysis:** The board is now:\n```\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X\n```\nI have 'O' in positions 0 and 1, while Player 1 has 'X' in positions 2, 4, and 8. Player 1 has formed a threat with three 'X's in column 2 and a significant presence in the center.\n\n2. **Defensive Priorities:** Player 1 is one move away from forming a three-in-a-row with their 'X's in column 2 (positions 2, 4, and 6). I must block this by playing in position 6.\n\n3. **Maintaining Control:** By placing an 'O' in position 6, I will not only block Player 1's potential win but also set myself up to go for a win on my next turn by creating a vertical threat as well as connecting with my own 'O's.\n\n4. **Offensive Patterns:** Although my immediate priority is to block my opponent, I also need to start thinking about how to win. By occupying position 6, I could potentially create lines on the left side of the board for myself.\n\n5. **Endgame Tactics:** Blocking Player 1\u2019s winning move and simultaneously positioning myself for a potential winning move in my following turn is crucial.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nTo block Player 1's imminent win and also create an opportunity for myself, I will place 'O' in position 6.\n\n**Moving to:** [6] \n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n```\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X\n```\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] **Knowledge Generation:**\n\n1. **Current State Analysis:** The current board state is:\n```\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X\n```\nThe opponent has 'O' in positions 0, 1, and 6, and I have 'X' in positions 2, 4, and 8.\n\n2. **Response to Opponent's Move:** The opponent has blocked my potential win and created a strong presence on the board, especially on the left side and bottom left corner.\n\n3. **Strategic Considerations:**\n   - **Defensive Priorities:** The opponent has a strong presence, but there are no immediate threats that I need to block at this moment.\n   - **Offensive Patterns:** I need to look for opportunities to create a winning line. With 'X' in positions 2, 4, and 8, I should look to utilize the center and create a fork or align my 'X's.\n\n4. **Available Moves Analysis:** The available moves are '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', and '[7]'. \n   - Position 4 is already occupied by 'X', so it can't be used.\n   - Position 3 is available and could be a good move to create a potential line or fork.\n   - Position 5 is available and could support a potential win by creating a line or fork on the middle row or a diagonal if the opponent doesn't block effectively.\n   - Position 7 is available and could be useful in creating a line or supporting my existing 'X' in position 8.\n\n5. **Move Decision:**\nTo create a potential winning opportunity, I should analyze the available positions. Playing in position 3 could be a good start as it:\n   - Creates a potential line or fork.\n   - Puts pressure on the opponent to respond.\n\nLet's choose position 3 for my next 'X'.\n\n**Moving to:** [3]\n\nThis results in the following board:\n```\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | X | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X\n```\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[4]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  **Knowledge Generation:**\n\n1. **Current State Analysis:** The board is now:\n```\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X\n```\nI have 'O' in positions 0, 1, and 6, while Player 1 has 'X' in positions 2, 3, 4, and 8. The opponent has a strong position due to clustering in the middle and adjacent rows.\n\n2. **Defensive Priorities:** Player 1 is two moves away from winning:\n   - They have two 'X's in the second row (positions 3 and 4) and can potentially complete it by placing an 'X' in position 5. Therefore, I must block this immediate threat.\n\n3. **Offensive Patterns:** While blocking is the priority, I also need to keep an eye on my own opportunities for creating lines. However, at this stage, preventing Player 1 from winning is more important.\n\n4. **Endgame Tactics:** Blocking Player 1's potential three-in-a-row is crucial. After blocking, I can then focus on setting up winning moves in subsequent turns.\n\n**Move Decision:** \nTo block Player 1's imminent win, I will place 'O' in position 5.\n\n**Moving to:** [5]\n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n```\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X\n```\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | 4 | O \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[4]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] **Knowledge Generation:**\n\n1. **Current State Analysis:** The current board state is:\n```\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X\n```\nThe opponent has 'O' in positions 0, 1, 5, and 6, and I have 'X' in positions 2, 3, 4, and 8. Both players have strong positions.\n\n2. **Response to Opponent's Move:** The opponent has blocked my potential win and created a solid defense.\n\n3. **Strategic Considerations:**\n   - **Defensive Priorities:** There are no immediate threats from the opponent that need to be blocked.\n   - **Offensive Patterns:** With 'X' in positions 2, 3, 4, and 8, I should look to either win or create a fork.\n\n4. **Available Moves Analysis:** The available moves are '[4]' and '[7]'. \n   - Position 4 is already occupied by 'X', so it can't be used.\n   - Position 7 is available and could be a potential move to create a line or support my existing 'X' in position 8.\n\n5. **Move Decision:**\nTo potentially win or create a strong position, I should place my next 'X' in position 7.\n\n**Moving to:** [7]\n\nThis results in the following board:\n```\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | X | X\n```\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[7]'",
