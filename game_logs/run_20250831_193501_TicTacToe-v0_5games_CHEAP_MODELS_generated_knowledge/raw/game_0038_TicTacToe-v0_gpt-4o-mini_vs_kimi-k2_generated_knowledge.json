Fork Threat Calculation  \n   \u2022 If Player 0 (O) takes a corner next turn, they will threaten a double-threat fork unless blocked immediately.  \n   \u2022 Our goal is to prevent that fork while simultaneously building our own two-way threats later.  \n\n3. Defensive Priors  \n   \u2022 Playing an edge now (positions 1, 3, 5, 7) immediately sets the opponent up for the dangerous corner-edge fork: e.g., O at 0 & 8 (double diagonal) or O at 0 & 6 (row/col) far more easily.  \n   \u2022 Playing a corner denies the opponent at least one branch of those deadly forks and retains corner-corner symmetry.  \n\n4. Long-Term Symmetry and Control  \n   Mirroring positions from a corner allows parity play (if opponent goes opposite side, we can mirror), making a draw the worst-case with perfect play. If we start with a non-corner, symmetry is broken early and easier tactical mistakes can arise.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Make Move Decision:\nWe must take a corner. Corners 0, 2, 6, 8 are symmetrically equivalent right now. Conventionally, choose the top-left corner.\n\nMy move: **[0]**\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] ### Generate Knowledge:\nAs Player 0 (O), I must evaluate my strategic options after Player 1 (X) placed their symbol in cell 0. In this board configuration, I need to consider the following key principles:\n\n1. **Defensive Priorities:**\n   - Player 1 (X) occupies a corner (0), which opens up multiple threats for winning combinations. I must look for immediate blocking opportunities to prevent Player 1 from creating a win on the next move.\n\n2. **Immediate Threats:**\n   - I need to check if Player 1 can create a winning line in the next turn. With their X in cell 0, the immediate threat is that they can win via position 3, 6, or 2, depending on their next move.\n\n3. **Offensive Opportunities:**\n   - I want to position my O strategically to create future winning opportunities while also blocking Player 1.\n\n4. **Building a Fork:**\n   - If I can set up a position where I threaten Player 1 with two possible wins on my next turn, I can drive towards victory.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Make Move Decision:\nConsidering that Player 1 has occupied the top-left corner, I need to prevent a potential win on my next turn by blocking any immediate threats. \n\nHere are my considerations:\n- If I place my O in cell 2, I block Player 1's opportunity to win with a potential X in 2 and keep my options open in the next turns.\n\nSo, I will place my O in position **[2]**.\n\nMy move is: **[2]**.\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] ### Generate Knowledge:\n\nCurrent layout:\n- X in 0, O in 2, 4 (center).\n- Diagonal from 0 to 8 is not yet compromised (8 open); diagonal 2-4-6 is halfway held by O.\n- Potential at-a-glance threats:\n   \u2013 If O plays 6, it immediately creates a vertical column 2-5-8 threat and completes diagonal 2-4-6 for a win. I must stop it.\n   \u2013 If O plays 8, it would complete a horizontal 2-5-8 row threat; not an immediate win but I\u2019d need block 5 next turn.\n- Therefore, **6** is a forcing win square for O right now.\n\nOverall strategic points:\n1. Block any instant wins first (priority rule in Tic-Tac-Toe).\n2. After the block, look to make a two-way-threat fork of my own.  \n3.

If Player 1 places an X in cell 3, they would win, so I must block that immediate threat.\n\n3. **Opportunities for Winning**:\n   - If I can place my O to establish a two-location win on subsequent moves after blocking, it would significantly improve my chances.\n   - Despite the offensive threats, the priority is to block any potential wins that do not compromise my position further.\n\n4. **Building a Fork**:\n   - I need to concentrate on blocking possible winning lines while seeking spaces that could lead to my winning fork in subsequent turns.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Make Move Decision:\nBlocking cell 3 is imperative to prevent an immediate win for Player 1. My best move is to place my O in position **[3]**.\n\nMy move is: **[3]**.\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[5]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] ### Generate Knowledge:\n\nCurrent board status:\n- **X**: 0, 6  \n- **O**: 2, 3, 4 (three O\u2019s form an unblocked horizontal in row 1 \u2192 3-4-5)  \nTherefore, **cell 5 is a MUST-BLOCK** to stop O from completing three in a row and winning immediately.\n\nAny other square that isn\u2019t 5 leads to an automatic loss for me on the next O turn.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Make Move Decision:\n\nI must occupy the only defensive square that prevents the immediate horizontal win.\n\nMy move: **[5]**\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] ### Generate Knowledge:\nAs Player 0 (O), I now need to evaluate the current board state after Player 1 (X) has placed an X in cell 5.

Consider aspects like:\n- Opening strategy (center vs corners vs edges)\n- Defensive priorities (when and what to block)\n- Offensive patterns (how to create forks and multiple threats)\n- Endgame tactics (forcing wins or draws)\n\nAfter generating this knowledge, apply it to make your move decision.\n\nFormat your move as '[number]' where number is 0-8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] ### Generate Knowledge:\nIn Tic Tac Toe, several key strategies and principles can significantly impact the outcome of the game, especially in this early phase:\n\n1. **Opening Strategy**:\n   - The center square (position 4) is the most advantageous starting spot as it can be part of multiple winning combinations (horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals).\n   - If the center is unavailable, taking a corner (positions 0, 2, 6, or 8) provides good potential for creating offensive plays and forcing your opponent into a defensive stance.\n\n2. **Defensive Priorities**:\n   - Always block your opponent (X) if they are one move away from winning. This could involve checking if they have two in a row that can be completed on their next turn.\n   - If there is no immediate threat from the opponent, focus on your offensive strategy.\n\n3. **Offensive Patterns**:\n   - Look for opportunities to create two potential winning moves on your next turn, known as a \"fork.\" This keeps your opponent on the defensive and can lead to an inevitable win.\n   - Placing an 'O' in a position that sets up two winning combinations simultaneously can be powerful.\n\n4. **Endgame Tactics**:\n   - In the latter stages of the game, pay close attention to both your and your opponent\u2019s potential winning moves. If a win is not possible, aim for a draw if your opponent plays optimally.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Make Move Decision:\nGiven that we're at the starting point with an empty board, the best strategy is to start in the center. Since all positions are available, I will place my 'O' in the center (position 4).\n\nSo, my move is: **[4]**.\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] ### Generate Knowledge:\nCurrent situation: Player 0 opened in the center (O in 4).
