I will make a new offer:\n\n**New Offer:**\n- I will offer 8 Sheep (value 96) and 4 Wheat (value 20) in return for 2 Ore (value 68).\n\nThis way, I am trading away a total value of 116 for an incoming value of 68. This isn't beneficial, so I will look instead at other options. \n\n**Final Decision:**\nAfter analyzing the trade possibilities again more closely, I'll try the following to see if Player 1 might be more interested: \n\n**Updated Offer:**\n- Offering 4 Wheat and 3 Sheep (total value 54) in exchange for 1 Brick (value 21).\n\nSo I'll make this offer:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick]' \n\nThis may appeal to Player 1 if they need Wheat and Sheep while I gain a Brick which contributes to future trades or strategy.
