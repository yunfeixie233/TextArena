      "response": "To analyze the current situation after the trades:\n\n**Current Resources and Values:**\n- Wheat: 7 (Value: 6) \n- Wood: 6 (Value: 9)\n- Sheep: 7 (Value: 13)  (Reduced from 16 due to trades)\n- Brick: 2 (Value: 26)  (Gained through trades)\n- Ore: 18 (Value: 38)  (Gained through trades)\n\n**Total Value Calculation:**\n- Wheat: 7 * 6 = 42\n- Wood: 6 * 9 = 54\n- Sheep: 7 * 13 = 91\n- Brick: 2 * 26 = 52\n- Ore: 18 * 38 = 684\n\n**Total Current Value:** 42 + 54 + 91 + 52 + 684 = 873\n\nNow, I'll consider potential offers. I have 7 Sheep and can afford to trade some more. \n\n**Current Strategy:**\n- Since I have more Ore and Brick, I can consider trading to get more valuable outputs or convert the remaining Sheep into something of higher value, ideally focusing on gaining more Bricks or Ore.\n\n**Next Move:**\nGiven the current situation, I see an opportunity to offer:\n- [Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]\n\nThis trade converts 5 Sheep (value 65) into 1 Brick (value 26) and 1 Ore (value 38), allowing a net gain of value.\n\n**Response:**\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]",

They offer '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' because 1 Ore (value 35) is worth more than 3 Wheat (value 12).\n\nExample 2: Player receives offer '2 Wood -> 4 Sheep'.

      "response": "Based on the trade offer evaluation:\n\n- **Receiving**: 5 Sheep  \n  Value = 5 \u00d7 18 = 90  \n- **Giving**: 1 Brick + 1 Ore  \n  Value = (1 \u00d7 28) + (1 \u00d7 32) = 60  \n- **Net gain**: 90 \u2212 60 = +30 value  \n\nThis trade increases my total resource value significantly. Even though Sheep has a lower per-unit value (18) compared to Brick (28) and Ore (32), the volume of Sheep received (5 units) outweighs the combined value of the resources surrendered.  \n\nAdditionally, after prior trades, my resource quantities remain sufficient:  \n- Brick: 5 \u2192 **4** (after trade)  \n- Ore: 6 \u2192 **5** (after trade)  \n- Sheep: 36 \u2192 **41** (after trade)  \n\nSince the goal is to maximize total value, accepting this offer is advantageous.
