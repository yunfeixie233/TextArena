      "response": "Let's quickly assess the situation.\n\nMy end-of-turn holdings  \n- Wheat 21 (6) \u2013 least valuable and plentiful  \n- Wood 6 (10) \u2013 moderate value, small stock  \n- Sheep 12 (13) \u2013 moderate value, plentiful  \n- Brick 7 (20) \u2013 high value, stock low  \n- Ore 25 (32) \u2013 highest value, stock high\n\nWhat has happened so far  \n- I\u2019ve tried three times to trade away Wheat + either Wood or Ore for Brick (+ sometimes Sheep). All rejected.  \n- Player 1 keeps trying to get my Brick for bundles whose per-unit value is below Brick\u2019s and well below the market exchange on the board. His last offer: 8 Wood + 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick. Value offered: 8\u00b710 + 3\u00b713 = 80. Value requested: 2\u00b720 = 40.  \nHe\u2019s offering almost twice the numeric value, but that is because my Brick and Ore are the scarcest high-value items in the game so far and he badly needs them. In a rational deal, however, I should be getting *more* value, not merely equal or slightly above.\n\nShould I still deal? Declining keeps the outsized value (Brick) out of his deck, which also hurts him.  \nBut note my own Brick count is only 7, and I may want more Brick myself for later turns. Hence value goes up even further for Brick right now. Conversely, I\u2019m excessively rich in Wheat and have spare Ore\u2014those are exactly the low-density deals Player 1 keeps refusing because they include Wheat.\n\nBest course: I\u2019d like more Brick, and I\u2019d like to dispose of Wheat without giving away Brick. However, the current offer forces me to give away precisely the highest-value resource I have. Giving 8 Wood + 3 Sheep is hardly worse for me, but it gives HIM the single most valuable commodity on the market at a steep discount. Declining is strictly better.\n\n[Deny]",
