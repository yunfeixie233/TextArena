We should aim to increase the total value.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of our Wheat (low value) for a more valuable resource. We have 10 Wheat, and giving some away could be beneficial if we receive a more valuable resource.\n\nFor example, offering 4 Wheat (value = 24) for 1 Brick (value = 27) could be a good trade because we are gaining value (27 - 24 = 3).\n\nNew Offer: [Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\n\nThis trade aims to exchange a less valuable resource for a more valuable one, potentially increasing our total resource value.\n\nAction: [Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
