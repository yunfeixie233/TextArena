However, if you think you can get more than your current value from other players, you can modify your offers accordingly.\n\nNow, here\u2019s a good initial offer you might consider based on the value of Brick:\n\n### Final Move\nTo start off with an advantageous negotiation, I would propose:\n\"[Offer: 6 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]\"\n\nThis exchange offers a total of 60 value from resources offered (6 Wheat at 6 each + 2 Wood at 10 each) for 78 in return (3 Brick at 26 each). \n\nLet\u2019s see how this trade goes!",

      "observation": "\n You are Player 0 in the Negotiation Game.\nYour task is to trade such that the total value of your resources increases.\nThe resources and associated values you currently have are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 19   Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 5    Value: 10\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 11   Value: 16\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 13   Value: 26\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 10   Value: 37\n\nHere are some examples of good trading decisions:\n\nExample 1: A player has 5 Wheat (value 4 each) and sees opponent needs Wheat. They offer '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' because 1 Ore (value 35) is worth more than 3 Wheat (value 12).\n\nExample 2: Player receives offer '2 Wood -> 4 Sheep'. They calculate: 2 Wood = 20 value, 4 Sheep = 60 value. Since they're giving less value than receiving, they respond '[Accept]'.\n\nExample 3: Player has excess low-value resources and offers '[Offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]' to convert multiple cheap resources into fewer valuable ones.\n\nUse the following special tokens for actions:\n  - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]': [Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\n  - '[Accept]': To accept an incoming offer.\n  - '[Deny]': To deny an incoming offer (default).\nThe game lasts for 10 turns in total.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 6 Wheat, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 3 Brick\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood -> Requested items: 3 Brick\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 3 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Brick\n Player 0 accepted the trade offer from Player 1.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 2 Brick\n Player 0 accepted the trade offer from Player 1.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 3 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Brick",
      "response": "At this point in the game, let's evaluate the trades that have occurred and focus on the current offer from Player 1.\n\n1. **Current Resources After Trades:**\n   - Initially:\n     - Wheat: 19\n     - Wood: 5\n     - Sheep: 11\n     - Brick: 13\n     - Ore: 10\n   - After accepting two trades from Player 1, where I gave away a total of 6 Wheat and received a total of 4 Brick:\n     - Wheat: 19 - 6 = 13\n     - Wood: 5 (unchanged)\n     - Sheep: 11 (unchanged)\n     - Brick: 13 + 4 = 17\n     - Ore: 10 (unchanged)\n\n2. **Current Offer from Player 1:**\n   - Offered items: 3 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Brick\n   - **Value Calculation:**\n     - 3 Wheat: 3 * 6 = 18\n     - 1 Brick: 26\n\n   The value of 3 Wheat (18) is less than the value of 1 Brick (26), so the trade is beneficial.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will accept Player 1's trade offer.\n\n**Response:**\n'[Accept]'",
