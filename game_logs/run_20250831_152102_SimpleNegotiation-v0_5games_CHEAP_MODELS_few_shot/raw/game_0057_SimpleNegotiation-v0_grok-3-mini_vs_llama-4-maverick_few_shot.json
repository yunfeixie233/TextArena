      "observation": "\n You are Player 1 in the Negotiation Game.\nYour task is to trade such that the total value of your resources increases.\nThe resources and associated values you currently have are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 8    Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 20   Value: 10\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 18   Value: 14\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 17   Value: 28\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 20   Value: 34\n\nHere are some examples of good trading decisions:\n\nExample 1: A player has 5 Wheat (value 4 each) and sees opponent needs Wheat. They offer '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' because 1 Ore (value 35) is worth more than 3 Wheat (value 12).\n\nExample 2: Player receives offer '2 Wood -> 4 Sheep'. They calculate: 2 Wood = 20 value, 4 Sheep = 60 value. Since they're giving less value than receiving, they respond '[Accept]'.\n\nExample 3: Player has excess low-value resources and offers '[Offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]' to convert multiple cheap resources into fewer valuable ones.\n\nUse the following special tokens for actions:\n  - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]': [Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\n  - '[Accept]': To accept an incoming offer.\n  - '[Deny]': To deny an incoming offer (default).\nThe game lasts for 10 turns in total.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Brick\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 1 Brick -> Requested items: 2 Sheep\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 2 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Sheep",
      "response": "Let's analyze the current situation and the last offer made by Player 0.\n\nCurrent resources and values:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 2    Value: 5 (since 6 Wheat were given away in the first two trades)\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 18   Value: 10 (since 2 Wood were given away in the first two trades)\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 18   Value: 14\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 17   Value: 28\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 22   Value: 34 (since 2 Ore were received in the first two trades)\n\nLast offer from Player 0: \nOffered items: 3 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Sheep\n\nLet's evaluate this offer:\n- Player 0 is offering 3 Wheat. Since Wheat is valued at 5, 3 Wheat = 3 * 5 = 15 value.\n- Player 0 is requesting 1 Sheep. Since Sheep is valued at 14, 1 Sheep = 14 value.\n\nThe value received (15) is greater than the value given (14), so accepting this trade would be beneficial.\n\nThe response to Player 0's offer should be: [Accept]\n\nSince the task is to respond to the current offer and potentially make a new offer, after accepting, let's examine our resources again and consider making a new offer.\n\nAfter accepting the last offer, the resources will be:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 5    Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 18   Value: 10\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 17   Value: 14\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 17   Value: 28\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 22   Value: 34\n\nTo make a new offer, we should look for opportunities to increase our total resource value. One possible strategy is to offer resources that are relatively less valuable for more valuable ones.\n\nWe have a significant amount of Wood (value 10) and some Wheat (value 5), which are relatively less valuable compared to Ore (value 34) or Brick (value 28). \n\nLet's consider offering some Wood for a more valuable resource. One possible offer could be:\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n\n Calculation: \n- 2 Wood = 2 * 10 = 20 value\n- 1 Brick = 1 * 28 = 28 value\n\nSince 28 (value received) is greater than 20 (value given away), this is a beneficial trade.\n\nSo, the actions for this turn are:\n1. Accept the last offer from Player 0.\n2. Make a new offer to Player 0.\n\nActions:\n[Accept]\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
