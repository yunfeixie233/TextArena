I will offer a combination of my excess resources for something more valuable.\n\nI'll proceed with the following trade offer:\n\n**[Offer: 8 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 2 Ore]**\n\nThis trade offers a conversion where I will exchange a combination of surplus resources for valuable Ore, which enhances my resource value. If Player 1 accepts this, it will significantly improve my overall resources and values. \n\nLet\u2019s see how Player 1 responds to this offer.",
