Prioritize converting lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) into higher-value resources (Ore, Brick).\n2. Maintain a good stock of high-value resources.\n3. Be open to exchanging resources for a net gain in value.\n\nGiven my current holdings, I have a good amount of Sheep, Brick, and Wood. My Ore count is lower, and its value is very high. Wheat is also in decent supply but has a low individual value.\n\nI will try to trade some of my abundant low-value resources (Sheep, Wood) for high-value Ore or Brick, or even a mix to consolidate my inventory into more valuable items.\n\nI will offer a combination of Sheep and Wood in exchange for Ore, as Ore has the highest value. I also have a lot of Sheep.\n\nLet's try to offer a profitable trade:\nOffer: 5 Sheep (5 * 16 = 80 value) + 2 Wood (2 * 9 = 18 value) = 98 value\nRequest: 2 Ore (2 * 39 = 78 value) + 1 Brick (1 * 20 = 20 value) = 98 value\n\nThis trade is balanced in terms of value, but I'm converting more plentiful resources into fewer, higher-value ones. This might be appealing to another player who needs Sheep or Wood. It also consolidates my inventory into more valuable resources.\n\nLet's refine the offer to ensure a clear value gain for me, even if it's a small one. I want to offer resources where I have a large quantity, and request resources I need more of or that are significantly more valuable.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep and Brick, and a decent amount of Wood. I have the least amount of Ore, which is also the most valuable. I want to aim for more Ore.\n\nLet's try this:\nOffer: 8 Sheep (8 * 16 = 128 value)\nRequest: 3 Ore (3 * 39 = 117 value)\n\nThis offer gives 128 value for 117 value. The goal is to offload abundant resources and gain more valuable ones. While the requested value is slightly lower, it allows me to get high-value Ore for plentiful Sheep.\n\nAnother option:\nOffer: 5 Sheep (5 * 16 = 80 value)\nRequest: 2 Brick (2 * 20 = 40 value) + 1 Ore (1 * 39 = 39 value) = 79 value\nThis is again close to even value, consolidating.\n\nLet's make sure I'm definitely gaining value or consolidating. I have a lot of Sheep. I want more Ore.\n\n[Offer: 8 Sheep -> 3 Ore]",
