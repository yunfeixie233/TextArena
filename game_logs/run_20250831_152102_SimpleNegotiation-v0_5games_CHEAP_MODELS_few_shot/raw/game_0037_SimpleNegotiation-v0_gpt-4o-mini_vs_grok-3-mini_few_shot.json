They offer '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' because 1 Ore (value 35) is worth more than 3 Wheat (value 12).\n\nExample 2: Player receives offer '2 Wood -> 4 Sheep'.

Assume the opponents may ask for a mix of resources. I can make strategic offers and accept trades that improve my total value.\n\n### Trading Strategy:\n\n1. **Offer Analysis**:\n   - I could offer a combination of low-value resources in exchange for high-value resources. For example, 5 Wheat can be traded for 1 Ore since it's worth significantly more in value.\n   - Alternatively, I can trade multiple lower-value items for fewer high-value items, for example, trading 10 Wheat and 2 Wood to acquire 1 Brick.\n\n2. **Negotiation Offers**:\n   - I will propose an initial offer that seems attractive based on my available resources:\n   - **Offer 1**: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]\n   - This offer trades relatively low-value resources (5 Wheat at 5 each = 25, and 2 Wood at 12 each = 24) for 2 Ore (74 total value) which is definitely advantageous.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Incoming Trades**:\n   - I will calculate if an incoming trade seems favorable based on the total values exchanged.\n\nFrom this strategy, my initial move would be:\n\n### My initial action:\n- **Offer**: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]\n\nI am concluding with the first action, ready to adjust times depending on opponents' responses.",

Calculate the value of my current resources.\n   - Wheat: 3 * 5 = 15\n   - Wood: 2 * 12 = 24\n   - Sheep: 17 * 17 = 289\n   - Brick: 22 * 28 = 616\n   - Ore: 3 * 37 = 111\n   - **Total Value: 15 + 24 + 289 + 616 + 111 = 1055**\n\n2. Evaluate potential trade offers. I have a surplus of Sheep and want to trade for potentially higher value resources or improve my resource distribution.\n\n**Suggested Offer:**\nI will offer some of my excess Sheep for Ore, as it's a higher-value resource compared to others. Specifically:\n\n**Offer:** \n- [Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis offers a decent trade-off since 5 Sheep (value 85) is less than 1 Ore (value 37). If the offer is accepted, I will improve my resource distribution while also aiming to increase my total resource value. \n\nI'll wait for Player 1's response to my offer.",
