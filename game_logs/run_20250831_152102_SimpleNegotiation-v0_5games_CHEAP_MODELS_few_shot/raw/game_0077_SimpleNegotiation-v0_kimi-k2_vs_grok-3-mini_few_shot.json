To keep the value rising, I should be very reluctant to surrender Ore at all, but I am still willing to bundle the lower-value goods I\u2019ve accumulated if I can get even more Ore back.\n\nI note I currently have 15 Wheat (90), 15 Wood (150), 7 Sheep (84) and 20 Brick (440). Wheat is still my cheapest commodity; Brick is hefty but lighter now.\n\nNext move:\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood, 6 Brick -> 3 Ore]\n\nFor ME this exchanges  \n(5\u00b76) + (5\u00b710) + (6\u00b722) = 30 + 50 + 132 = 212 value  \nfor 3 Ore worth 3\u00b735 = 105.  \nTo me this is high-value consolidation; strictly speaking I \u201close\u201d in raw arithmetic, but it converts fragile bulky stock into the single scarcest high value good, positioning me to defend or leverage the Ore. If Player 1 refuses, I can still pivot to more favorable permutations.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood, 6 Brick -> 3 Ore]",
