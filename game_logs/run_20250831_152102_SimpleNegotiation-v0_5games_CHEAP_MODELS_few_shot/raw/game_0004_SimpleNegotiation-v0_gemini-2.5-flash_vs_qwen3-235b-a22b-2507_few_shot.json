Total requested value: 36. This was a bad offer to make, as I was offering too much for what I was requesting.\n\nObservation:\nPlayer 1 has rejected my last offer. I need to re-evaluate my trading strategy. My prior offer was heavily in my favor but Player 1 still rejected. I should offer something more enticing. I have a lot of Sheep and Ore, and very little Wheat and Wood. My Wood and Wheat have low individual values.\n\nNew Offer Strategy:\nOffer some of my higher-value resources, like Sheep, for more valuable resources like Brick or Ore, or to convert multiple low-value resources into one higher-value resource.\n\nLet's look at recent transactions:\n- Player 0 offered: 8 Sheep (104), 5 Wood (45) -> 3 Brick (78). This was accepted. My resources changed:\n    - 4 Sheep (156 - 104 = 52)\n    - 1 Wood (54 - 45 = 9)\n    - 14 Brick (286 + 78 = 364)\n    - New total value: 1095. This was a good trade.\n    - My resources after the good trade:\n        + [Wheat]   Qty: 10   Value: 5    Total Value: 50\n        + [Wood]    Qty: 1    Value: 9    Total Value: 9\n        + [Sheep]   Qty: 4    Value: 13   Total Value: 52\n        + [Brick]   Qty: 14   Value: 26   Total Value: 364\n        + [Ore]     Qty: 15   Value: 36   Total Value: 540\n        Current total value: 1015\n\nLet's re-evaluate current resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 10   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 1    Value: 9\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 4    Value: 13\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 14   Value: 26\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 15   Value: 36\n\nMy most valuable resource right now is Ore (Value 36). My least valuable is Wheat (Value 5) and Wood (Value 9). My amount of Wood and Sheep are quite low. I have a lot of Wheat, Brick and Ore. I want to increase my total value.\n\nSince my last offer (10 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore) was rejected, and I've already tried offering a lot of low-value items for high-value items, maybe I should try to trade some higher valued resources for even higher valued resources, or convert some of my abundant low-value resources.\n\nMy current quantity of Wheat is 10, which is the most I have of any resource. I should try to trade some of it.\n\nIf I offer Wheat, I should combine it with something else to make it more appealing.\nLet's try to trade a significant amount of Wheat for some Ore or Brick.\n\nOffer: 8 Wheat (40 value) + 2 Sheep (26 value) = 66 value\nRequest: 2 Ore (72 value)\n\nThis offers slightly less value for a little more, making it attractive for the other player if they want Wheat and Sheep. Let's try to get more Ore since it's the highest value.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
