They offer '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' because 1 Ore (value 35) is worth more than 3 Wheat (value 12).\n\nExample 2: Player receives offer '2 Wood -> 4 Sheep'. They calculate: 2 Wood = 20 value, 4 Sheep = 60 value. Since they're giving less value than receiving, they respond '[Accept]'.\n\nExample 3: Player has excess low-value resources and offers '[Offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]' to convert multiple cheap resources into fewer valuable ones.\n\nUse the following special tokens for actions:\n  - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]': [Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\n  - '[Accept]': To accept an incoming offer.\n  - '[Deny]': To deny an incoming offer (default).\nThe game lasts for 10 turns in total.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 5 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 8 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 6 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 5 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Brick\n Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 7 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.",
      "response": "My current resources and values after the prior exchanges:\n\n- Wheat: 21 \u2212 (6 + 5 + 7) = 3 left (value 5 each)  \n- Wood: 13 (value 12)  \n- Sheep: 22 (value 13)  \n- Brick: 9 + 1 = 10 (value 20)  \n- Ore: 7 + 1 + 1 = 9 (value 40)\n\nChecklist:\n1. I am driving the entire market; Player 1 never initiates, so each turn I must decide only what to propose next.\n2. I still have low-value resources I can convert upward (excess Wood/Sheep).\n3. Ore remains my highest-value resource, so targeting more Ore is still attractive.\n\nQuick conversion table (my outgoing vs. incoming):\n\u2013 1 Ore (value 40) vs. 6 Wheat (value 30) is already expired; I have little Wheat left.  \n\u2013 1 Brick (value 20) vs. 5 Wheat (value 25) also expired.  \n\u2013 Wood 13 \u2192 possibly 1 Ore each 3 Wood (value 36 vs 40) if Player 1 is willing.  \n\u2013 Sheep 22 \u2192 possibly 1 Ore each 4 Sheep (value 52 vs 40) still profitable, but the margin is thin.\n\nBest marginal offer:\nI have far more Sheep than I need; I can spare several without hurting flexibility. Moving 4 Sheep for 1 Ore still nets me value.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
