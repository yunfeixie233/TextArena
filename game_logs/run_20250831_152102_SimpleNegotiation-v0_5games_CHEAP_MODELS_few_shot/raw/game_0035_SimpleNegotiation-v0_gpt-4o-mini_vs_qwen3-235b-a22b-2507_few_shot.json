      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I'll analyze my current resources and strategize my offers based on their values.\n\nHere's a breakdown of my current resources:\n\n- Wheat: 12 (Value: 6 each, Total: 72)\n- Wood: 12 (Value: 10 each, Total: 120)\n- Sheep: 20 (Value: 14 each, Total: 280)\n- Brick: 15 (Value: 21 each, Total: 315)\n- Ore: 8 (Value: 32 each, Total: 256)\n\nIn assessing my resources, I notice I have a good amount of Sheep and Wood, which may be used to trade for higher-value resources like Ore and Brick.\n\n### Potential Trading Strategies:\n\n1. Given the higher value of Ore and Brick, I will focus on trading my excess Wood and Sheep to acquire these resources.\n2. I might also consider trading excess quantities of my resources for more Brick, as I have a moderate amount already and it's valuable.\n\n### Example Offer:\n\nI will make an initial offer that aims to convert my low-value resources (Wood and/or Sheep) into something more valuable (like Ore or Brick).\n\n**First Offer:**\nGiven that 1 Ore is much more valuable than 3 Wheat or 2 Wood, I could propose:\n\n'[Offer: 5 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick]'\n\nThis offers 50 value (5 Sheep) + 30 value (3 Wood) = 80 total value for 21 value (1 Brick). It\u2019s a net loss, so this offer needs to be adjusted.\n\nLet\u2019s refine that!\n\n**Revised Offer:**\nInstead, I'll offer:\n\n'[Offer: 8 Wood, 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore]'\n\nHere:\n- 8 Wood = 80 value + 4 Sheep = 56 value = 136 total value given.\n- 2 Ore = 64 value = 64.\n\nThis is better, as I\u2019m trading away 136 value for 64 value. \n\nThis trade provides a better opportunity to consolidate lower-value resources into higher-value ones.\n\nIf you receive offers from other players during the game, I will evaluate them based on how they compare in value.\n\n**My First Move:**\n'[Offer: 8 Wood, 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore]' \n\nLet\u2019s see how it goes!",

A better approach would be to find a trade that increases your total resource value.\n\n### Next Steps:\nSince Player 1 has not made an offer, let's consider another trade proposal. You need to offer something that converts lower-value resources to higher-value ones or trades between resources that serve your needs better.\n\nGiven your high amount of Sheep, you might want to focus on converting those into either Wheat or Ore, which have higher values. \n\nLet's offer a new trade:\n\n**New Offer Proposal**:\n- Offer 8 Sheep and 2 Wood for 1 Ore\n\nThis exchange has the following values:\n- Value of 8 Sheep = 8 * 14 = 112\n- Value of 2 Wood = 2 * 10 = 20\n- Total Value Given = 112 + 20 = 132\n\n- Requested 1 Ore = 32 value.\n\nThis improves your balance significantly, receiving more value than you're giving.\n\n### Final Action:\nTherefore, I will make the following trade offer:\n\n```\n[Offer: 8 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n```",
