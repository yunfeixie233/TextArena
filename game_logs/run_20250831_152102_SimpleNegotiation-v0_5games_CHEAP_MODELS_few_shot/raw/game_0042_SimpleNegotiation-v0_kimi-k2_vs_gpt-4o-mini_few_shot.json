Ore is our crown jewel (39 each) and we still have 11 of them.\n\nGiven that all subsequent trades must be proposed by us, and Player 1 clearly prefers to accept ONLY proposals that massively favour them, the safest play is to make no offer at all in the remaining moves (stopping the bleeding). Instead we wait until Player 1 finally proposes something.\n\nTherefore:\n\n[Deny]",

For example, I can target a potential offer for Ore, as it is high-value.\n\n**Offer**: \n'[Offer: 9 Wheat -> 2 Ore]'\n\nThis trade converts surplus low-value resources into high-value commodities.
