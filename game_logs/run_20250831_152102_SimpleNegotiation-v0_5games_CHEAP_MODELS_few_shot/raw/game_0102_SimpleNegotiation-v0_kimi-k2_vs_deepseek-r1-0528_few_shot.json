Strategic evaluation:\n   - I have excess Brick (24) which I could potentially trade away since its value (20) is solid but not as high as Ore (34)\n   - Wheat dropped in value but I still have 15, so I can afford to trade some\n   - Ore is valuable - I want more if possible\n   - Wood is critically low (only 3) - I should avoid trading any away\n\n5. Optimal next move: Convert some lower-value resources into higher-value ones. Brick at 20 could be traded for Ore at 34.
