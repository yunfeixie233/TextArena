Brick and Ore are higher-value resources; thus, trading excess low-value resources like Wheat or Wood for higher-value commodities can be an effective strategy.\n\n### New Offer Proposal:\nA useful next step would be to offer some of your excess Sheep, as you have a significant quantity (20) at a reasonably high value (12 each). An offer could be:\n\n- **Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick**\n  - Value Calculation:\n    - 5 Sheep = 60 (5 * 12)\n    - 2 Brick = 40 (2 * 20)\n    - You are giving 60 value for 40 value, which isn't favorable.\n\nInstead, here\u2019s a more appealing offer:\n\n1. **Combine Sheep and additional resources to create a more balanced offer:**\n   - Offer: 10 Sheep -> 3 Ore\n   - Value Calculation:\n     - 10 Sheep = 120 (10 * 12)\n     - 3 Ore = 108 (3 * 36)\n     - You're giving 120 for 108; if accepted, you acquire higher-value resources.\n\n### Final Action:\nTo implement your next move, I will propose the following trade to maximize resource value:\n\n**Proposal:**\n\n`[Offer: 10 Sheep -> 3 Ore]` \n\nLet\u2019s see how Player 1 responds to this offer!",
