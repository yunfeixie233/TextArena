I already have ample Wheat and Wood.  \n\n**Decision:**  \n- This trade is infeasible (due to insufficient Brick) and strategically harmful (massive value loss).  \n- I will **deny** the offer.  \n\n### Response:  \n[Deny]  \n\n**Next Move Consideration:**  \nI will prepare a new trade offer in the next turn to convert excess low-value resources (e.g., Wheat/Wood) into high-value ones (Brick/Ore) to optimize my portfolio.  \n\n*(Note: This response follows the required format for a reply to an opponent's offer.)*",
