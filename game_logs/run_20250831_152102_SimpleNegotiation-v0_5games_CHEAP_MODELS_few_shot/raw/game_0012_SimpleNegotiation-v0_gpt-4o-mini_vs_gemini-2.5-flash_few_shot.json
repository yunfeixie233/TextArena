      "response": "Given the current state of the game, you have successfully made a trade where you offered 10 Wood for 2 Ore. \n\nNow, let\u2019s analyze your current inventory:\n\n- Wheat: 5 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 13 (after trading 10 for Ore) (Value: 11)\n- Sheep: 5 (Value: 13)\n- Brick: 20 (Value: 23)\n- Ore: 21 (after gaining 2 from the trade) (Value: 40)\n\nNext, you need to make strategic decisions for future trades to continue increasing your total resource value.\n\nSince you have an excess of Wood and possibly Wheat as well, you can make an offer that would convert lower-value resources into higher-value resources. \n\nI will propose the following offer to Player 1 or another player if they are available to trade:\n\n**New Trade Offer:**\n- **[Offer: 10 Wood -> 4 Sheep]**\n\nLet's evaluate this decision:\n- 10 Wood (Value: 55) vs. 4 Sheep (Value: 52)\n\nThis is a slight advantage in value for you; however, the trade could help you gather more Sheep, which hold good value and may help in future trades. \n\nIf Player 1 accepts the offer, great!
