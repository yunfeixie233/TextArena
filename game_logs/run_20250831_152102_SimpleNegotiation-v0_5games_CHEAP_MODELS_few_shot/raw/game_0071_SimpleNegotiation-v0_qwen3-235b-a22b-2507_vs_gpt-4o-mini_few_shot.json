The value calculations are as follows:\n\n- **Offer**: \n  - 10 Wood = 10 * 12 = 120 Value\n  - 3 Wheat = 3 * 6 = 18 Value\n  - **Total Offer Value** = 120 + 18 = 138 Value\n\n- **Requested**:\n  - 5 Brick = 5 * 20 = 100 Value\n\nTrading 138 Value for 100 Value seems favorable, given I am exchanging more low-value resources for fewer high-value resources.\n\n**My trading proposal will be:**\n'[Offer: 10 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 5 Brick]'",
