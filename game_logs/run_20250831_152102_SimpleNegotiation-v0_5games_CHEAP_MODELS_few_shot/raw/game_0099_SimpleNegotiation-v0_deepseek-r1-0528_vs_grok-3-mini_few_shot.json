      "observation": "\n You are Player 0 in the Negotiation Game.\nYour task is to trade such that the total value of your resources increases.\nThe resources and associated values you currently have are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 5    Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 13   Value: 9\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 14   Value: 18\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 14   Value: 29\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 6    Value: 34\n\nHere are some examples of good trading decisions:\n\nExample 1: A player has 5 Wheat (value 4 each) and sees opponent needs Wheat. They offer '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' because 1 Ore (value 35) is worth more than 3 Wheat (value 12).\n\nExample 2: Player receives offer '2 Wood -> 4 Sheep'. They calculate: 2 Wood = 20 value, 4 Sheep = 60 value. Since they're giving less value than receiving, they respond '[Accept]'.\n\nExample 3: Player has excess low-value resources and offers '[Offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]' to convert multiple cheap resources into fewer valuable ones.\n\nUse the following special tokens for actions:\n  - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]': [Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\n  - '[Accept]': To accept an incoming offer.\n  - '[Deny]': To deny an incoming offer (default).\nThe game lasts for 10 turns in total.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 1 Ore -> Requested items: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 1 Ore, 2 Wheat -> Requested items: 2 Sheep, 2 Wood\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Brick\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore",
      "response": "[Deny]  \n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]  \n\n**Explanation:**  \n- Player 1's offer of `3 Wheat, 1 Sheep` for `1 Ore` would have given me **33 points of value** (3\u00d75 + 1\u00d718) but cost **34 points** (1\u00d734), resulting in a net loss. Thus, I denied it.  \n- My new offer:  \n  - **Giving:** 2 Wood (2\u00d79 = 18 points) and 1 Wheat (1\u00d75 = 5 points) \u2192 total **23 points**.  \n  - **Requesting:** 1 Brick (1\u00d729 = **29 points**).  \n  - This trade yields a net gain of **6 points** (29 - 23) and leverages my abundant Wood (13 left) and Wheat (4 left) to acquire higher-value Brick. Player 1 has rejected similar Brick requests before, but this offer is more balanced (closer to Brick's value).",
