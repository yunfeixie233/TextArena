I have a significant amount of Wheat and some Wood, which are of lower value compared to Ore and Brick.\n\nLet's offer: `[Offer: 8 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\n- Value given: (8 * 5) + (2 * 9) = 40 + 18 = 58\n- Value received: 1 * 36 = 36\n\nThis offer is not favorable as per the initial calculation since I'm giving more value than I'm receiving. Let's adjust the strategy.\n\n### Adjusted Offer\n\nLet's re-evaluate and adjust the offer: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\n- Value given: 4 * 5 = 20\n- Value received: 1 * 22 = 22\n\nThis offer is favorable as I'm receiving more value than I'm giving.\n\n### Turn 1 Action\n\nI will make the following offer: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis is my action for Turn 1.

Since Sheep is less valuable than Brick and significantly less valuable than Ore, let's evaluate:\n- Offering 1 Sheep (13) and 1 Wood (9) for 1 Brick (22) is a good trade because 1 Sheep + 1 Wood = 22, which equals the value of 1 Brick.\n\nLet's make an offer:\n```\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n```\nThis trade aims to exchange less valuable resources for a more valuable one, thus potentially increasing our total value.\n\n### Action Taken\n\n```\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n```",

      "response": "To determine the best action, let's first update the resources and their values after the previous trades.\n\nInitially:\n- Wheat: 24 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 14 (Value: 9)\n- Sheep: 16 (Value: 13)\n- Brick: 15 (Value: 22)\n- Ore: 23 (Value: 36)\n\n1. After the first trade (8 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore):\n- Gave: 8 Wheat (8*5 = 40), 2 Wood (2*9 = 18)\n- Received: 1 Ore (1*36 = 36)\n- Total value change: -40 - 18 + 36 = -22\n- Updated quantities: Wheat = 24 - 8 = 16, Wood = 14 - 2 = 12, Ore = 23 + 1 = 24\n\n2. After the second trade (1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick):\n- Gave: 1 Sheep (1*13 = 13), 1 Wood (1*9 = 9)\n- Received: 1 Brick (1*22 = 22)\n- Total value change: -13 - 9 + 22 = 0\n- Updated quantities: Sheep = 16 - 1 = 15, Wood = 12 - 1 = 11, Brick = 15 + 1 = 16\n\n3. After the third trade (1 Brick -> 1 Ore):\n- Gave: 1 Brick (1*22 = 22)\n- Received: 1 Ore (1*36 = 36)\n- Total value change: -22 + 36 = 14\n- Updated quantities: Brick = 16 - 1 = 15, Ore = 24 + 1 = 25\n\nCurrent state:\n- Wheat: 16 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 11 (Value: 9)\n- Sheep: 15 (Value: 13)\n- Brick: 15 (Value: 22)\n- Ore: 25 (Value: 36)\n\nNow, let's analyze the latest offer from Player 1: Offered items: 5 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n\n- Gave (Player 1): 5 Wheat (5*5 = 25)\n- Received (Player 1): 1 Ore (1*36 = 36)\n- For Player 0: Receiving 5 Wheat (5*5 = 25), Giving 1 Ore (1*36 = 36)\n\nFor Player 0, this trade means:\n- Gave: 1 Ore (36)\n- Received: 5 Wheat (25)\n- Total value change: -36 + 25 = -11\n\nSince the trade results in a negative value change for Player 0, it's not beneficial.\n\nThe best response to this offer is: [Deny]\n\nLet's consider making a new offer. To increase the total value of resources, we should aim to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\nCurrent values:\n- Total value = (16*5) + (11*9) + (15*13) + (15*22) + (25*36)\n- Total value = 80 + 99 + 195 + 330 + 900 = 1304\n\nWe can look for opportunities to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values. One potential trade could be offering some Wheat or Wood (lower value) for Brick or Ore (higher value).\n\nLet's propose a new offer:\n- We can offer some of our Wheat (value: 5) or Wood (value: 9) for Brick (value: 22) or Ore (value: 36).\n\nConsidering our resources, an example could be: '[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Brick]'.\n- Gave: 4 Wood (4*9 = 36)\n- Received: 1 Brick (1*22 = 22)\nThis trade isn't favorable as we're giving more value than we're receiving.\n\nA more favorable trade could be: '[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]'.\n- Gave: 3 Wheat (3*5 = 15), 1 Wood (1*9 = 9)\n- Total given: 15 + 9 = 24\n- Received: 1 Ore (1*36 = 36)\nThis trade is favorable because we're receiving more value than we're giving.\n\nThus, the action for this turn is: [Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

However, the last trade with Player 1 involving Wheat (5 Wheat for 1 Ore) was rejected by me because the value comparison wasn't favorable (5 Wheat = 25 value, 1 Ore = 36 value, so it was a good decision).\n\nLet's examine possible trades:\n1. Offering Wheat for Ore: Not favorable unless the ratio is better than 5:1.\n2. Offering Wood for Brick or Ore: Since Wood is more valuable than Wheat but less than Brick and Ore, a trade like 'Wood for Brick' could be considered if the ratio is reasonable.\n\n### Decision\nLet's make an offer to Player 1: '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'. \n- 3 Wheat = 3 * 5 = 15 value\n- 1 Ore = 1 * 36 = 36 value\nThis trade increases my total value.\n\n### Action\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
