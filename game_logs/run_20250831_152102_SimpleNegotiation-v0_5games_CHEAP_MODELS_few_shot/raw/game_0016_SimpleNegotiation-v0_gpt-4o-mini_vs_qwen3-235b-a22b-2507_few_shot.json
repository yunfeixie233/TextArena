Offered: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> Requested: 1 Ore\n   - Resources after trade: \n     - Sheep: 7 - 4 = 3\n     - Wood: 3 - 2 = 1\n     - Ore: 14 + 1 = 15\n\n**Current Resources:**\n- Wheat: 21 (Value: 126)\n- Wood: 1 (Value: 11)\n- Sheep: 3 (Value: 48)\n- Brick: 8 (Value: 184)\n- Ore: 15 (Value: 525)\n\n**Total Value:**  \nValue = 126 (Wheat) + 11 (Wood) + 48 (Sheep) + 184 (Brick) + 525 (Ore)  \nTotal Value = 894\n\nNow, let\u2019s make an offer based on the current resources. Since I have an excess of Brick and Ore, I can offer a trade to balance my resources further while increasing value.\n\n**New Offer:**\nI'll convert some of my excess Ore into a useful resource. I will offer:\n- **[Offer: 4 Ore -> 2 Brick]**\n\nThis way, I exchange some of my higher-value Ore for Brick, which still retains a good value. \n\n**Next Action:**\n[Offer: 4 Ore -> 2 Brick]",
