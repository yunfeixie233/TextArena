      "response": "As a competitive player aiming to increase my total resource value, I analyze my current holdings and the values per unit:\n\n- **Wheat**: 6 units, each worth 1\n- **Wood**: 6 units, each worth 2\n- **Brick**: 15 units, each worth 2\n- **Sheep**: 6 units, each worth \u22482.833 (17/6)\n- **Ore**: 9 units, each worth \u22483.555 (32/9)\n\nMy total value is 97 (6 + 12 + 17 + 30 + 32). To increase this, I prioritize trading away lower-value or surplus resources for higher-value ones. Wheat has the lowest per-unit value (1), while Brick is in surplus with 15 units. Sheep (\u22482.833 each) offers a higher value, and trading for it can yield a net gain.\n\nI propose offering 2 Wheat for 1 Sheep:\n- I give 2 Wheat, total value: 2 * 1 = 2\n- I receive 1 Sheep, value: \u22482.833\n- Net value gain: approximately +0.833\n\nThis trade is attractive because I exchange low-value Wheat for a higher-value resource at a favorable ratio. If accepted, it increases my value without depleting key resources, leaving me with wheat for future trades. Given my large Brick surplus, I may target Ore (highest value) in later turns once the market responds.\n\nAction: **[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]**",

      "response": "I have analyzed the current offer from Player 1:  \n- **Offering**: 2 Sheep (total value: 2 \u00d7 17 = 34)  \n- **Requesting**: 1 Ore (value: 32)  \n\n**Calculation**:  \n- Value gained: 34 (from 2 Sheep)  \n- Value lost: 32 (from 1 Ore)  \n- **Net gain**: +2 (34 \u2212 32 = +2)  \n\n**Resource Impact**:  \n- My Sheep increase from 6 to 8 (no urgent need, but adds value).  \n- My Ore decreases from 8 to 7 (Ore is high-value, but I still retain ample supply).  \n\n**Strategic Consideration**:  \n- This trade slightly increases my total worth (sheep value per unit: 17, ore: 32, so 2\u00d717 > 32).  \n- No immediate risk of resource depletion.  \n\n**Decision**:  \nSince this trade benefits my total value, I accept.  \n\n`[Accept]`",
