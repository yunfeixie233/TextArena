They offer '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' because 1 Ore (value 35) is worth more than 3 Wheat (value 12).\n\nExample 2: Player receives offer '2 Wood -> 4 Sheep'. They calculate: 2 Wood = 20 value, 4 Sheep = 60 value. Since they're giving less value than receiving, they respond '[Accept]'.\n\nExample 3: Player has excess low-value resources and offers '[Offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]' to convert multiple cheap resources into fewer valuable ones.\n\nUse the following special tokens for actions:\n  - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]': [Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\n  - '[Accept]': To accept an incoming offer.\n  - '[Deny]': To deny an incoming offer (default).\nThe game lasts for 10 turns in total.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 1 Ore -> Requested items: 8 Wood\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Brick\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 1 Brick -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 1 Ore -> Requested items: 6 Wood\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 1 Brick -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 1 Brick, 2 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 1 Ore -> Requested items: 1 Brick, 3 Wood\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 1 Brick, 2 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore",
      "response": "[Deny]  \nI am rejecting the offer because I would lose value: receiving 1 Brick (23) and 2 Wheat (10) for a total of 33, while giving 1 Ore (37) results in a net loss of 4.  \n\n[Offer: 1 Ore, 5 Wheat -> 3 Brick]  \n**Reasoning**:  \n- **I give**: 1 Ore (value 37) + 5 Wheat (5 \u00d7 5 = 25) = total value 62.  \n- **I request**: 3 Brick (3 \u00d7 23 = 69), which exceeds what I give by 7 in value.  \nThis trade increases my total value by consolidating excess, low-value Wheat into higher-value Brick. I have ample Ore (24) and Wheat (24), so this deal optimizes my resource value efficiently.",
