It seems I miscalculated my Wheat inventory in the previous turn.\nLet's restart the inventory after the accepted trade:\nPlayer 0 offered 5 Wheat for 1 Sheep resulting in:\n- Wheat: 7 - 5 = 2\n- Sheep: 6 + 1 = 7\n- Wood: 14\n- Brick: 22\n- Ore: 14\nMy total value is 2*5 + 14*11 + 7*18 + 22*27 + 14*34 = 10 + 154 + 126 + 594 + 476 = 1360.\n\nNow, considering the current offer from Player 1: \"Offered items: 2 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Sheep\"\n\nI have 2 Wheat, so I cannot offer 2 Wheat. I must have miscalculated my inventory after the first trade. Let me be extremely careful.\n\nStart inventory:\nWheat: 7 (Value: 5)\nWood: 14 (Value: 11)\nSheep: 6 (Value: 18)\nBrick: 22 (Value: 27)\nOre: 14 (Value: 34)\nInitial Total Value: 7*5 + 14*11 + 6*18 + 22*27 + 14*34 = 35 + 154 + 108 + 594 + 476 = 1367\n\nTurn 1: Player 0 offered 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep. Player 1 accepted.\nMy new inventory:\nWheat: 7 - 5 = 2\nWood: 14\nSheep: 6 + 1 = 7\nBrick: 22\nOre: 14\nMy total value: 2*5 + 14*11 + 7*18 + 22*27 + 14*34 = 10 + 154 + 126 + 594 + 476 = 1360 (This is a decrease, but the goal is to increase total value for the *opponent*, not me specifically, or I misunderstood Example 1, but Example 2 suggests I should accept if I gain value)\nRe-reading example 1: \"1 Ore (value 35) is worth more than 3 Wheat (value 12)\". This means Player 0 *gained* value. So my goal is always to increase my total value.\nMy initial offer of 5 Wheat (25 value) for 1 Sheep (18 value) was a bad offer from my side in terms of value. I was thinking about getting rid of abundant low-value items. I should only offer if I get better value back.\n\nOkay, let's re-evaluate after the first trade. The game state provided that Player 0 made an offer of '5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep' and Player 1 accepted. This transaction *did* happen. My inventory *is* now:\nWheat: 2\nWood: 14\nSheep: 7\nBrick: 22\nOre: 14\n\nMy immediate previous action was to offer \"2 Sheep -> 1 Ore\", which Player 1 rejected.\nThis is my current state based on the chat history.\n\nNow,Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: \"Offered items: 2 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Sheep\"\n\nMy current inventory:\nWheat: 2\nWood: 14\nSheep: 7\nBrick: 22\nOre: 14\n\nPlayer 1 is offering 2 Wheat. I don't have 2 Wheat to give them because I only have 2 Wheat. They are offering 2 Wheat to *me* and asking for 1 Sheep *from* me.\n\nLet's re-read: \"Offered items: 2 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Sheep\"\nThis means Player 1 is offering ME 2 Wheat.\nAnd Player 1 is requesting FROM ME 1 Sheep.\n\nValue of items I would receive (2 Wheat): 2 * 5 = 10\nValue of items I would give away (1 Sheep): 1 * 18 = 18\n\nSince 10 < 18, I would be receiving less value than I am giving away. This offer would decrease my total value. Therefore, I should deny it.\n\nMy inventory if I were to accept:\nWheat: 2 + 2 = 4\nWood: 14\nSheep: 7 - 1 = 6\nBrick: 22\nOre: 14\nNew total value: 4*5 + 14*11 + 6*18 + 22*27 + 14*34 = 20 + 154 + 108 + 594 + 476 = 1352.\nMy current value is 1360. 1352 < 1360. So, I must deny.\n\n[Deny]",
