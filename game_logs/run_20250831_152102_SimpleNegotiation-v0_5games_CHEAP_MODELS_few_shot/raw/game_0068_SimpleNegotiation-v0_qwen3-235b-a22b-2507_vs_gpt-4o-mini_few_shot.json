      "observation": "\n You are Player 0 in the Negotiation Game.\nYour task is to trade such that the total value of your resources increases.\nThe resources and associated values you currently have are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 15   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 18   Value: 8\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 12   Value: 14\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 17   Value: 23\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 11   Value: 40\n\nHere are some examples of good trading decisions:\n\nExample 1: A player has 5 Wheat (value 4 each) and sees opponent needs Wheat. They offer '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' because 1 Ore (value 35) is worth more than 3 Wheat (value 12).\n\nExample 2: Player receives offer '2 Wood -> 4 Sheep'. They calculate: 2 Wood = 20 value, 4 Sheep = 60 value. Since they're giving less value than receiving, they respond '[Accept]'.\n\nExample 3: Player has excess low-value resources and offers '[Offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]' to convert multiple cheap resources into fewer valuable ones.\n\nUse the following special tokens for actions:\n  - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]': [Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\n  - '[Accept]': To accept an incoming offer.\n  - '[Deny]': To deny an incoming offer (default).\nThe game lasts for 10 turns in total.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Sheep\n Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 5 Wheat, 4 Wood -> Requested items: 3 Sheep, 1 Brick\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 7 Wheat, 6 Wood -> Requested items: 4 Sheep, 2 Brick\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 9 Wheat, 8 Wood -> Requested items: 5 Sheep, 3 Brick\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 4 Sheep, 2 Ore -> Requested items: 3 Brick",
      "response": "[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 3 Brick]  \n\nWait \u2014 Player 1 has already made an offer:  \n**Offered: 4 Sheep, 2 Ore \u2192 Requested: 3 Brick**\n\nI am Player 0. I need to evaluate this offer.\n\nCurrent resources (Player 0):  \n- Wheat: 15 (val 5)  \n- Wood: 18 (val 8)  \n- Sheep: 12 (val 14)  \n- Brick: 17 (val 23)  \n- Ore: 11 (val 40)  \n\nPlayer 1 is offering:  \n- 4 Sheep = 4 \u00d7 14 = 56 value  \n- 2 Ore = 2 \u00d7 40 = 80 value  \n\u2192 Total incoming value = 56 + 80 = **136**\n\nI would give up:  \n- 3 Brick = 3 \u00d7 23 = **69 value**\n\nI am giving 69 value and receiving 136 value \u2192 **Net gain of 67 value**\n\nThis is a very favorable trade.\n\n[Accept]",
