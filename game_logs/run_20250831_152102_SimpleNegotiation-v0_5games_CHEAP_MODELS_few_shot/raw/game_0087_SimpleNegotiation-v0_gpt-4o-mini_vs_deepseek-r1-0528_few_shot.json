      "response": "### Analysis of Current Situation\n- **Current Resources (After Recent Trades)**:\n  - **Wheat**: 13 units (Value: 6 each) \u2014 Total value: 78  \n    *Increased due to previous trade (1 Wood \u2192 3 Wheat with Player 0).*\n  - **Wood**: 5 units (Value: 11 each) \u2014 Total value: 55  \n    *Decreased after successful trade (3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore with Player 0).*\n  - **Sheep**: 14 units (Value: 13 each) \u2014 Total value: 182  \n    *Untraded so far; high quantity and moderate value.*\n  - **Brick**: 12 units (Value: 25 each) \u2014 Total value: 300  \n    *Previously offered for Ore but rejected.*\n  - **Ore**: 11 units (Value: 36 each) \u2014 Total value: 396  \n    *Increased through trades; high-value target.*\n\n- **Total Value**: 78 + 55 + 182 + 300 + 396 = 1,011  \n- **Goal**: Increase total value by trading away **lower-value resources** for **higher-value ones** (e.g., Ore at 36). Player 0 has previously accepted offers for Ore in exchange for Wood and rejected offers involving Brick/Sheep mixtures.\n\n### Strategy for Next Trade\n- **Why 2 Sheep for 1 Ore?**  \n  - We have excess Sheep (14 units) at moderate value (13 per unit). Trading 2 Sheep costs us 26 in value (2 \u00d7 13).  \n  - Gaining 1 Ore provides 36 in value, a net gain of **+10 value** (36 - 26).  \n  - Player 0 has shown willingness to trade Ore (e.g., accepted 3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore). Offering a simple, resource-specific deal may appeal to them.  \n- **Alternative Options Considered**:  \n  - **3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore**: Net gain of +3 value (36 - 3\u00d711 = 3), but we have less Wood (5 units) now and may need to conserve it.  \n  - **Brick-focused trades**: Previously rejected by Player 0 and risks losing high-value resources.  \n  - **Wheat-focused trades**: Wheat is our lowest-value resource (6 per unit), but Player 0 has offered to dump Wheat on us, making it unattractive.  \n\nGiven these factors, offering **2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore** maximizes potential value gain while leveraging our excess Sheep.  \n\n### Action\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
