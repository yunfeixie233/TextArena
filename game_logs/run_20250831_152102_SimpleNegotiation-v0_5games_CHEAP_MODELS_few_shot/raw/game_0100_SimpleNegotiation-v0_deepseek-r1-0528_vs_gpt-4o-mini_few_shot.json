      "response": "After reviewing my current resources and previous trade attempts, I need to maximize my total value by trading with Player 1 this turn. With only 1 Wood left and an abundance of Sheep (13) and Brick (23), I aim to acquire high-value Ore while minimizing losses. Previous successful trades involved Wood for Ore, but my Wood stock is low. Since 1 Wood (value 11) plus 1 Sheep (value 13) sums to 24 value, and 1 Ore is worth 35, offering this combination gives me a net gain of 11 if accepted. Player 1 may accept due to the immediate resource diversity. \n\nThus, I propose:\n\n[Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
