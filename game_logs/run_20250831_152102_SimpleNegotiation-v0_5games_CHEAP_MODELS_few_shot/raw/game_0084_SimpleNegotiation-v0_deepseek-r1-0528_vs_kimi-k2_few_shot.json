      "response": "Looking at the 5 completed trades, I see clear patterns:\n\n- I already gave away 5 more Wheat + 3 more Wood to obtain 2 Brick, so my low-value stash is shrinking faster than my high-value one.\n- Player 0 is reluctant to give up Brick (rejecting all single-Brick proposals while only accepting when the exchange ratio was extremely favorable to them).\n- My remaining high-value Ore (21 units @ 36) vastly outweighs my low-value Wheat (now 6 units @ 5) and Wood (now 1 unit @ 12).\n\nSince Brick has such high value (29) and my low-value resources are almost gone, the most profitable next move is to upgrade my remaining over-supplied low value resources into Brick while the ratio is still positive.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
