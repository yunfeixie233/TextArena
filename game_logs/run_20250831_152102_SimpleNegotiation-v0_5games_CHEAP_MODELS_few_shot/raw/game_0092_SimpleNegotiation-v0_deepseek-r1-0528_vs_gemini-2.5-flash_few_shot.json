This exact offer format was previously accepted by Player 1 (in the last successful trade), making it a strategic repeat to leverage proven terms. Wheat is low-value surplus (only 5 left post-trade), and Wood is moderately abundant (4\u21923). Prioritizing Ore acquisition maximizes value density.*",
