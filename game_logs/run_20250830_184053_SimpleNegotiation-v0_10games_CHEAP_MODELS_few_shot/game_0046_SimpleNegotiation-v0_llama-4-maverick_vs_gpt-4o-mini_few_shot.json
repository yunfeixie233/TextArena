      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to understand the initial total value and then decide on the trades. Let's start by calculating the initial total value of my resources.\n\n1. Wheat: 22 * 6 = 132\n2. Wood: 22 * 12 = 264\n3. Sheep: 18 * 12 = 216\n4. Brick: 24 * 28 = 672\n5. Ore: 24 * 36 = 864\n\nTotal initial value = 132 + 264 + 216 + 672 + 864 = 2148\n\nMy goal is to increase this total value through trades.\n\nGiven the values, it seems that Ore and Brick are the most valuable resources. To increase the total value, I should look to trade resources that are less valuable for either Brick or Ore, or maintain my current amount of these resources while getting rid of less valuable ones.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n\n1. I have a lot of Wheat (value 6), Wood (value 12), and Sheep (value 12), which are relatively less valuable compared to Brick (value 28) and Ore (value 36).\n\n2. A potential trade could involve offering some of the less valuable resources to get more Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's make an initial offer. I will offer 5 Wheat, 2 Wood, and 1 Sheep (total value = 5*6 + 2*12 + 1*12 = 30 + 24 + 12 = 66) to see if I can get 2 Brick (value = 2*28 = 56), which is still less than what I'm offering. However, an even better deal would be to get Ore.\n\nSo, my first offer will be:\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (10*6 + 1*12) = 72 for 1 Ore worth 36.

After third trade: Offered: 5 Wood, 2 Sheep -> Requested: 4 Brick. So, Wood: 21 - 5 = 16, Sheep: 13 - 2 = 11, Brick: 29 - 4 = 25.\n5.

Let's analyze what we have and what could be beneficial to trade.\n\n## Step 4: Determine a trade offer\nWe need to decide on resources to offer and request. Since we have a good amount of Brick and Ore, which are valuable, we should consider if we can trade something less valuable for something more valuable or equally valuable but in a better quantity.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a trade\nWe could offer some Wheat (least valuable per unit) or Wood (relatively less valuable compared to Ore or Brick) for more valuable resources. Let's consider offering Wheat or Sheep for Ore or Brick.\n\n## Step 6: Propose a trade offer\nLet's offer 4 Wheat for 1 Ore (since Ore is very valuable and we have relatively less Wheat). The offer would be: [Offer:4 Wheat ->1 Ore].\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the new total value if the trade is accepted\nIf we offer 4 Wheat for 1 Ore and it's accepted:\n- Wheat: 7 - 4 = 3\n- Ore: 24 + 1 = 25\nNew total value = (3 * 6) + (14 * 12) + (11 * 12) + (26 * 28) + (25 * 36) = 18 + 168 + 132 + 728 + 900 = 1946\n\n## Step 8: Check if the trade increases the total value\nThe new total value (1946) is greater than the current total value (1934), so the trade is beneficial.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer:4 Wheat ->1 Ore]}$",

Offered: 4 Wheat -> Requested: 1 Ore (Rejected)\n5. Offered: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> Requested: 1 Ore (Accepted)\n\n### Next Steps:\nSince we're on turn 7 and have 3 turns left, we need to strategize effectively.\n\n1. **Evaluate Current Resources and Values**: We have a good mix of resources but need to ensure we're maximizing our total value.\n\n2. **Consider Potential Trades**: We should look for opportunities to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or to consolidate resources that are highly valued.\n\n3. **Analyze Player 1's Likely Interests**: Based on previous trades, Player 1 seems willing to give up Ore for various combinations of resources. We should continue to leverage this if possible.\n\n### Proposed Trade:\nLet's examine a potential trade. We have relatively low-value Wheat and a moderate amount of Wood and Sheep. We have acquired a significant amount of Brick and Ore.\n\nGiven that Ore is highly valued and we've been successful in getting it from Player 1, let's try to offer a trade that involves resources we have in surplus or moderate quantity for Ore.\n\n### Potential Offer:\n- We can offer: 4 Wood, 1 Sheep (Value: 4*12 + 1*12 = 60)\n- We can request: 1 Ore (Value: 36)\n\nThis trade would involve: [Offer: 4 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis is a reasonable trade as we're offering resources worth 60 for Ore worth 36, but it reduces our Wood and Sheep slightly while keeping our Ore high.\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
