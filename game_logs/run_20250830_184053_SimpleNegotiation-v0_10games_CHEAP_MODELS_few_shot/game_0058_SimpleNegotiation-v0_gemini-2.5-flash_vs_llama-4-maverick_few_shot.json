However, without knowing Player 0's current resources, it's speculative.\n\nLet's make an offer that could potentially increase our total value. We could offer some Wheat (the lowest value resource) for Ore (one of the highest value resources), if we think Player 0 might have Ore.\n\nLet's propose: [Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis translates to: [Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe action in the required format is: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`. \n\nThe response is: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`.",
