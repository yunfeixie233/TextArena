I am low on Wood (only 8, value 9), but each Ore is worth 33\u201334. I want more Ore.  \n2. I have 14 Brick left (value 25), plenty to spare, and still enough Wheat (19) for a big future offer.\n\nI will now formulate a trade that keeps me competitive while using an acceptable ratio for my opponent.\n\nKey idea: Every Ore I raise my value by 33. Giving up 4 Brick (4\u00d725 = 100) and 4 Wheat (4\u00d75 = 20) for 3 Ore (3\u00d733 = 99) is roughly a fair 1-for-1 point trade to my opponent if they value Wood or Sheep. But evidently they said no last time because it asks only Ore in return. So this time I look to convert two cheap resources (Brick + Wheat) into Ore and get myself a small net-value gain while lowering the number of Ore I ask for.\n\nTherefore, I offer:\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick, 3 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\n\nThat gives me a net value gain of:\n\n\u2013 I lose 3 Brick (3\u00d725 = 75)  \n\u2013 I lose 3 Wheat (3\u00d75 = 15)  \n\u2013 I gain 2 Ore (2\u00d733 = 66)\n\nNet change: -90 + 66 = -24 value in raw points \u2013 however that\u2019s 3:2 instead of 4:3 and asking for *only* 2 Ore rather than 3, improving the perceived ratio for Player 1, so this offer is much more likely to be accepted.\n\nIf later turns open up, I can continue converting Wood or Wheat into Ore at competitive margins, but for now I\u2019ll try to secure 2 more Ore this way.\n\nMy next offer is therefore:\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick, 3 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",
