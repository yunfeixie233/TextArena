I should aim for offers where the requested value is higher than the offered value.\n\nPlayer 1 rejected my previous offer. This is good because the offer was not good for me.\n\nI need to make a new offer that increases the total value of my resources. I have a lot of Brick. Ore is one of the most valuable resources.\n\nLet's try to get Ore by offering Brick.\n\nIf I offer 3 Brick (value 72) for 3 Wheat (value 18), that would be bad.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (value 72) for 1 Ore (value 34), that would be bad.\n\nI need to request more value than I offer.\n\nLet's try to offer a resource I have plenty of and request a higher value resource.\nI have 17 Brick. I can spare some. I want to get more Ore.\n\nHow about offering something less valuable to me, for something more valuable?\nI have 12 Wheat (value 6).\nI have 7 Wood (value 12).\nI have 5 Sheep (value 14).\nI have 17 Brick (value 24).\nI have 9 Ore (value 34).\n\nPlayer 1 previously rejected my offer, so they likely found it unfavourable to them.\n\nI want to initiate a trade that is profitable for me and might be acceptable for Player 1.\nIf I offer 2 Brick (Value: 48) for 1 Ore (Value: 34), it's bad for me.\nIf I offer 1 Ore (Value: 34) for 2 Brick (Value: 48), it's good for me. This is what I want, but I doubt Player 1 will accept it directly after rejecting my last offer.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nWhat if I offer a mix of items?\nI have a lot of Brick.\nI will try to make an offer where the value of what I get is higher than what I give.\n\nPerhaps 3 Brick (Value: 72) for 1 Ore (Value: 34) + 1 Wood (Value: 12) = 46. This is still losing value.\n\nLet's rethink my strategy. I want to acquire high-value items, like Ore.\nI have plenty of Brick (17) and Wheat (12).\n\nWhat if I offer a resource that I have a low quantity of, for a high quantity of a resource I have a low quantity of?\nNo, that's not right.\n\nI should offer resources with a lower relative value or excess quantity for resources with a higher relative value or those I want more of.\n\nLet's try offering a small amount of Brick for a slightly higher overall value of other resources.\nI will try this:\nOffer: 3 Brick (Value: 72)\nRequest: 2 Sheep (Value: 28) + 1 Ore (Value: 34) = 62. Still losing value.\n\nOkay, let's try to offer quantity for quality.\nI have a lot of Brick.\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore for 3 Sheep and 2 Wood?\nValue of 1 Ore = 34.\nValue of 3 Sheep = 3 * 14 = 42.\nValue of 2 Wood = 2 * 12 = 24.\nTotal received value = 42 + 24 = 66.\nThis is profitable for me (get 66 value, give 34 value), and might be appealing to Player 1 if they need those resources.\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep, 2 Wood]",
