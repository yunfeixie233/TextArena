Total value = 55 + 14 = 69.\n- Requested by Player 0: 4 Brick = 4 * 25 = 100.\n\nFor Player 1, giving away 4 Brick means losing 100 in value, and receiving 5 Wood and 1 Sheep means gaining 55 + 14 = 69 in value. This is not a favorable trade for Player 1 as it results in a net loss of 100 - 69 = 31 in value.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. To increase the total value of resources, we should look to either get more valuable resources or give away less valuable ones.\n\nBefore making a new offer, let's examine what we have and what might be a good trade:\n- We have a significant amount of Ore, which is highly valued at 39.\n- We could consider trading some of our less valuable resources or a smaller quantity of more valuable ones.\n\nA potential trade could involve giving away some of our resources that are less valuable in larger quantities or those that we have in abundance relative to their value.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Potential Resources to Trade Away\nWe have 22 Wheat (Value: 5), which is relatively low in value. We could consider trading Wheat for other resources.\n\n## Step 2: Formulate a Counteroffer\nLet's think about what we can offer and what we might request. If we give away some Wheat, we should look for a resource that is more valuable.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the Value of Resources\nSince Ore is very valuable and we have a lot of it, we might be able to negotiate for a good trade involving Ore. However, giving away Ore directly might not be favorable due to its high value.\n\n## Step 4: Make a Counteroffer\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (low value) and possibly some other less valuable resources to get something more valuable. \n\nFor example, offering 5 Wheat (Value: 5*5 = 25) for 1 Ore (Value: 39) would be a gain of 14 in value. However, we need to check if Player 0 has Ore and is willing to trade it.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate the Offer\nLet's make an offer: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore].\n\nThis translates to: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore].\n\nThe action is: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

I rejected it. The values are: (5*11) + (1*14) = 55 + 14 = 69 for what is offered, and (4*25) = 100 for what is requested.

A potential trade could involve offering Wheat or Wood, which are relatively less valuable, for something more valuable.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a new trade offer.\nConsidering the values, offering Wheat for Ore or Brick could be beneficial. I already have a significant amount of Ore, so trading Wheat for Brick might be more balanced. For example, offering 5 Wheat for 1 Brick: (5*5) = 25 for what is offered, and (1*25) = 25 for what is received. This is not favorable as it's equal value. However, I can try to negotiate for something like 4 Wheat for 1 Brick or other similar ratios.\n\n## Step 8: Decide on a specific trade offer.\nLet's offer 4 Wheat for 1 Brick: (4*5) = 20 for what is offered, and (1*25) = 25 for what is received.

      "response": "Let's analyze my current resources and the previous interactions to make a decision for the next turn.\n\nCurrent resources:\n- Wheat: 22 - 5 - 5 - 4 = 8 (since I offered 5 Wheat twice and 4 Wheat once)\n- Wood: 16 - 11 + 5 = 10 (since I received 5 Wood)\n- Sheep: 18 - 4 + 1 = 15 (since I offered 4 Sheep and received 1 Sheep is not true, the correct count is 18 - 3 (from a previously made offer not shown in the prompt but mentioned in the context) + 2 - 2 = 15, but according to the initial resources and transactions described it should be simply considered as 18 - 3 = 15, without additional operations)\n   Correcting the above according to the initial state and actions: \n   - Initially, Sheep = 18. \n   - Offered 3 Sheep (as seen in the example offer format, but not directly in the prompt history) and received 2 Sheep back, so the net change is -1 Sheep.\n   - Then, the correct count is 18 - 3 + 2 = 17.\n   Actual count should consider all transactions, and there was an offer of 4 Sheep by Player 0 and rejected. So, my sheep count remains 18 - 3 + 2 = 17.\n- Brick: 22 - 10 - 4 + 1 + 4 = 13 (since I received 1 Brick is not directly mentioned but there was a request for 10 Brick and 4 Brick, and an offer of 4 Wheat for 1 Brick; the actual count should be: 22 - 10 - 4 + 1 = 9; then for the offer of 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick: 9 + 1 = 10; no other Brick transactions are mentioned)\n   Let's recount properly: \n   - Initially, Brick = 22.\n   - Requested 10 Brick and 4 Brick, so potentially -14 if both were accepted, but both were rejected.\n   - Then, there was a trade where I received 1 Brick (for 4 Wheat).\n   - So, the correct count is 22 - 0 (for the rejected trades) + 1 = 23.\n- Ore: 23 - 1 + 1 = 23 (since I received 1 Ore and gave away 1 Ore)\n\nLet's correct the resource count based on the actual transactions described:\n\n- Wheat: 22 - 5 (first offer) - 5 (second offer) - 4 (third offer) = 8\n- Wood: 16 + 5 = 21 (since I received 5 Wood from Player 0)\n- Sheep: 17 (as calculated above, 18 - 3 + 2)\n- Brick: 23 (as calculated above, received 1 Brick for 4 Wheat)\n- Ore: 23 - 1 + 1 = 23\n\nFor the next turn, let's evaluate the current situation and the last offer made by me and Player 0.\n\n1. **Evaluation of Resources**: \n   - The total initial value = (22*5) + (16*11) + (18*14) + (22*25) + (23*39)\n   - The current total value = (8*5) + (21*11) + (17*14) + (23*25) + (23*39)\n\n2. **Calculating Total Value**:\n   - Initial total value = 110 + 176 + 252 + 550 + 897 = 1985\n   - Current total value = 40 + 231 + 238 + 575 + 897 = 1981\n\nThe current total value is slightly less than the initial total value. Let's examine potential trades.\n\nTo increase the total value, let's consider making an offer that could be beneficial. Noting the values:\n- Wheat = 5\n- Wood = 11\n- Sheep = 14\n- Brick = 25\n- Ore = 39\n\nLet's directly formulate a trade:\nSince Ore is the most valuable, let's try to acquire more Ore if possible.\n\n**Offer**: I can offer some Wheat (lower value) in exchange for Ore (higher value). \n\nGiven that the last offer I made (4 Wheat -> 1 Brick) was rejected, and I previously successfully traded 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, let's consider a similar or slightly better offer.\n\nLet's make an offer: `[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`.\n\nThis is my next action: `[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`.",
