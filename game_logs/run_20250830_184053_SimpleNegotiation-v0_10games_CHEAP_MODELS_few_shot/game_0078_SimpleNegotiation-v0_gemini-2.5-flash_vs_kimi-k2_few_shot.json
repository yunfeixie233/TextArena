After our counter-proposal in round 4 (\u201c8 Wheat \u2192 3 Ore\u201d) was rejected, Player 0 instantly pivots and puts the SAME ratio on the table:  \n   \u201c8 Wheat \u2192 3 Ore\u201d.\n\nWhat we just learned\n\u2022 The moment Player 0 himself offered 8 wheat for 3 ore, he revealed he is willing to transact at an implicit ratio of **1 Ore \u2248 2.667 Wheat** (37:14.8).  \nTherefore Player 0\u2019s internal valuation is    wheat \u2264 14.8 per unit.\n\nWe have 25 wheat.  Three ore is worth 111 to us (3\u00d737) while 8 wheat is only worth 48 to us.  Even after giving up 3 ore we would still hold 11, so we can trade the ore later.\n\nConclusion: Player 0 just adopted our counter-price as his own, proving he is now ready to pay it.  Accepting this exact offer locks in a net value gain of  \n111 \u2013 48 = +63 for us and ends this tedious loop.\n\n[Accept]",
