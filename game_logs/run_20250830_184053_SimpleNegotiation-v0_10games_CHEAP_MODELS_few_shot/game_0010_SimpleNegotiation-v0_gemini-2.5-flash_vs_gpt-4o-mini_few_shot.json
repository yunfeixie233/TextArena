I need more Ore. I also have a lot of Wheat and Wood which have low value. I should try to trade them for higher valued resources.\n\nLast 5 turns:\n1. Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n   Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\n   My resources after trade:\n   \t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 17   Value: 6\n   \t+ [Wood]    Qty: 10   Value: 8\n   \t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 13   Value: 13\n   \t+ [Brick]   Qty: 14   Value: 22\n   \t+ [Ore]     Qty: 6    Value: 39\n   Value of offered items: (2 * 8) + (2 * 6) = 16 + 12 = 28\n   Value of requested items: 1 * 39 = 39\n   I successfully made a profitable trade!\n\n2. Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 4 Wood, 1 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n   Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n   Value of offered items: (4 * 8) + (1 * 6) = 32 + 6 = 38\n   Value of requested items: 1 * 39 = 39\n   This was a good offer for me. Player 1 rejected, meaning they might not be in a position to give up Ore or are looking for a better deal for themselves.\n\n3. Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 4 Wood, 1 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n   Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n   Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n   Value of offered items: (4 * 8) + (1 * 6) = 32 + 6 = 38\n   Value of requested items: 1 * 39 = 39\n   This is the same offer Player 0 made in the previous turn. I rejected it because it was not my turn to offer, and I don't want to accept an offer that I initiated in the first place, especially if I can make a better offer on my turn.\n\n4. Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n   Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 5 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n   Value of offered items: (5 * 13) + (1 * 6) = 65 + 6 = 71\n   Value of requested items: 1 * 39 = 39\n   This is a bad trade for me. Player 1 is asking for too much. I rejected.\n\n5. Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n   Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 5 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n   Value of offered items: (5 * 13) + (1 * 6) = 65 + 6 = 71\n   Value of requested items: 1 * 39 = 39\n   This was my previous rejected offer to player 1. I still really want Ore. Maybe Player 1 is desperate for Sheep. I offered this just to see if they would accept it from me.\n\n6. Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n   Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 5 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> Requested items: 2 Ore\n   Value of offered items: (5 * 13) + (2 * 6) = 65 + 12 = 77\n   Value of requested items: (2 * 39) = 78\n   This is a good trade for me, value wise. I rejected it because I mistakenly wrote I rejected it in game. This is where I need to be careful with the game log. I should have accepted this!\n\n7. Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n   Player 0 made no new trade offer.\n   Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\n   Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 5 Sheep, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 2 Ore, 1 Brick\n   Value of offered items: (5 * 13) + (2 * 8) = 65 + 16 = 81\n   Value of requested items: (2 * 39) + (1 * 22) = 78 + 22 = 100\n   This is a very good deal for me! I should accept it. My previous turn I said I rejected the previous offer when I should have accepted it. I need to be very careful moving forward to accept good offers.\n\nMy current resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 17   Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 10   Value: 8\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 13   Value: 13\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 14   Value: 22\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 6    Value: 39\n\nI will accept player 1's offer. My quantity of sheep is high and I have plenty of wood. I should gain 2 Ore and 1 Brick, both of which are high value.\n[Accept]",
