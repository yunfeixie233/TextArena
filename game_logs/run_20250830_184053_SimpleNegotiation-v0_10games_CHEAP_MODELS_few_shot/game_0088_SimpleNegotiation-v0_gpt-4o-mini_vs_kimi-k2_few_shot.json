Ore: Value 38 per unit. Total value (17 * 38) = 646.\n2. Brick: Value 26 per unit. Total value (11 * 26) = 286.\n\nPlayer 0 currently has much ore, and trading it for brick can be beneficial because Player 0 can trade some of the ore, which has a higher initial value, for bricks.\n\n### Offer Decision\nI will accept Player 1's trade offer because gaining 4 additional bricks can help improve resource flexibility for future trades.\n\n**Response to Player 1:**\n[Accept]",
