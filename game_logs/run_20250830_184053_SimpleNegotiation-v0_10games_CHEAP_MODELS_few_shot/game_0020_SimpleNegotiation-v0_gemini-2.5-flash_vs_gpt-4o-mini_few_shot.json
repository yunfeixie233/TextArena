      "response": "I am Player 0.\nMy current resources are:\n  - Wheat: 17 (Value: 5)\n  - Wood: 9 (Value: 10)\n  - Sheep: 12 (Value: 14)\n  - Brick: 6 (Value: 25)\n  - Ore: 17 (Value: 37)\n\nThe total value of my current resources is (17*5) + (9*10) + (12*14) + (6*25) + (17*37) = 85 + 90 + 168 + 150 + 629 = 1122\n\nI want to increase the total value of my resources. I will make an offer that aims to achieve this.\n\nMy strategy is to trade resources I have in abundance or those with lower value for resources that are more valuable.\n\nLet's look at the value ratios to make a profitable trade.\nWheat (5) < Wood (10) < Sheep (14) < Brick (25) < Ore (37)\n\nI have a lot of Wheat (17) and Ore (17). While Ore is valuable, I might be able to trade some less valuable resources for more valuable ones, or consolidate some types.\nTrading 1 unit of a lower value resource for 1 unit of a higher value resource is good.\nTrading multiple units of a lower value resource for fewer units of a higher value resource is also good, as long as the total value gained is higher than the total value given.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick or Ore, as they are the highest value resources.\nI have 12 Sheep (value 14).\nI have 6 Brick (value 25).\n\nIf I trade Wheat (5) and Wood (10) for Brick (25) or Ore (37).\nFor instance, 2 Wheat (10 value) might be exchangeable for 1 Wood (10 value).\nOr 3 Wheat (15 value) for 1 Sheep (14 value). This is not profitable.\n2 Wood (20 value) for 1 Brick (25 value). This is profitable. Give 20, get 25.\n1 Wood (10) and 1 Sheep (14) = 24 value for 1 Brick (25 value). This is profitable.\n\nLet's try to trade some of my Wood and Sheep for Brick or Ore.\n\nCurrent Value: 1122\n\nOffer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep (Value: 2*10 + 1*14 = 20 + 14 = 34)\nRequest: 1 Ore (Value: 37)\nNet profit: 37 - 34 = 3. This is a small profit, but a profit nonetheless.\n\nAnother approach: Get more of the highest value resource (Ore) by giving up less valuable ones.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Ore. I also have a decent amount of Sheep and Wood.\nI want to increase my total value.\n\nLet's make an aggressive offer aiming for a good value gain.\nPerhaps trading some of my lower value resources for more Brick or Ore.\n\nI have 17 Wheat (Value 5). I can afford to trade some.\nI have 9 Wood (Value 10).\nI have 12 Sheep (Value 14).\n\nLet's try to get more Brick.\nOffer: 2 Sheep (Value 2*14 = 28)\nRequest: 1 Brick (Value 25) and 1 Wood (Value 10) = 35. This would be profitable (gain 7) but they lose more than I gain (they lose 35, gain 28). They wouldn't accept.\n\nI need to make an offer that benefits both parties, or at least isn't a massive loss for the opponent, while still being profitable for me.\n\nLet's try to trade resources that I have a high quantity of, or that are low value, for higher value resources.\n\nConsider my Wheat (17 @ 5 = 85) and Wood (9 @ 10 = 90).\nI could try to trade 3 Wheat for 1 Wood (15 vs 10, not good for me).\n\nWhat about trading a low-value resource for a high-value resource?\nExample: 5 Wheat (value 25) for 1 Brick (value 25). This is a 0 sum trade, but it consolidates my resources. I would gain 1 Brick and lose 5 Wheat. This might be useful if I need Brick, but not for value increase.\n\nI'm aiming for a net value increase.\n\nLet's consider trading some of my low-value resources for a high-value resource.\nOffer: Wheat and Wood for Brick.\n\nOffer: 3 Wood (Value 3*10 = 30)\nRequest: 1 Brick (Value 25) and 1 Sheep (Value 14) = 39.\nThis is 30 loss for me, 39 gain for me. Net +9.\nThis is 39 loss for them, 30 gain for them. Net -9. They won't accept this.\n\nI need to make the offer more balanced for the opponent.\n\nLet's try to offer a higher value of my resources than I ask for in return, but in a way that *I* benefit from the type of resource received.\n\nI have 17 Ore. It's my highest value resource. I don't want to trade it lightly.\nI have 6 Brick. It's also high value.\nI have 12 Sheep. Good quantity.\nI have 9 Wood. Not a lot.\nI have 17 Wheat. Abundant, low value.\n\nI want more Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's try an offer that consolidates my lower-value resources into higher-value ones.\nI have a lot of Wheat. Can I trade it for something else?\nOffer: 4 Wheat (Value 20)\nRequest: 1 Wood (Value 10) and 1 Wheat (Value 5) = 15. Not profitable.\n\nOkay, let's rethink. Profitable for me MEANS the total value of resources I GAIN is GREATER than the total value of resources I GIVE.\n\nI have 9 Wood (Value 10).\nI have 12 Sheep (Value 14).\nI have 6 Brick (Value 25).\n\nLet's try to get more Brick.\nOffer: 2 Sheep (Value 2*14 = 28)\nRequest: 1 Brick (Value 25)\nThis is a loss of 3 for me. Not good.\n\nOffer: 1 Sheep (Value 14) and 1 Wood (Value 10) = 24.\nRequest: 1 Brick (Value 25).\nMy gain: 25. My loss: 24. Net profit for me: +1.\nThis is an acceptable trade for me. It might be acceptable for the opponent too, as their loss is minimal (-1 of value). They might accept it to get diverse resources or for strategic reasons.\n\nLet's propose this.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
