      "response": "[Thoughts]  \n- My highest-value resource is **Ore** (34 pts each). I\u2019d rather not trade it away unless I get valuable, scarce resources in return.  \n- Among the low-value units, **Wheat** (5 pts) is by far the worst and plentiful: I have 20 of them.  \n- **Brick** is scarce (only 6 units) but the priciest at 22 pts each; stocking up on Brick could boost my total value quickly.  \n- **Wood** (12 pts) is mid-value and I have plenty (24) so it is expendable.  \n- **Sheep** is also 12 pts but I have only 5, so I\u2019d only trade small amounts.  \n\nI want to offload Wheat and possibly Wood in exchange for Brick.  \nA 5-to-1 Wheat-for-Brick conversion rate is fair (5 pts \u2192 22 pts) but I\u2019ll start at 4 Wheat for 1 Brick to make it attractive.\n\n[Negotiation]  \n\u201cHey Player 0! I noticed you might need some Wheat or Wood for your builds. I\u2019m willing to part with 4 Wheat and 2 Wood for 1 Brick. That\u2019s 44 value incoming to me, 32 outgoing, which is favorable for you if you value Wheat/Wood right now. If that works let me know, otherwise I\u2019m open to a slight tweak.\u201d",
