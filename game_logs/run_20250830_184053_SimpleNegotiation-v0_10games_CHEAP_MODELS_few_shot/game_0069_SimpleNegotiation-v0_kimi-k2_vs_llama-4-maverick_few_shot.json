      "response": "Let me begin with a concise, objective statement: no activity from the last round changes the remaining eight pictures on the ten-round clock, so we still have eight moves to make deals.  \n\nFrom my point of view, the only thing that matters is that every card that leaves my hand and every card that enters it adjust my net score by the fixed values I revealed at the start. Those numbers are still:\n\n- Wheat\u20036  \n- Wood\u2003 9  \n- Sheep\u200218  \n- Brick\u200221  \n- Ore\u2003 34  \n\nThat last line alone tells me: Ore is king, Brick is second-best, Sheep supports both, and Wheat / Wood are the \u201csmall change\u201d of the game. I am trying to pack as much value as possible into my hand before the clock hits zero.\n\nHistory-to-date in one sentence: \n\nCross table show  \n\u2003Player 0 gave 4 Wheat + 2 Wood and took 2 Brick + 1 Ore \u2192 pure gain (net value +29 \u201336 = \u20137 \u2026 a loss, actually)  \n\u2003Player 0 later gave 3 Brick and took 2 Ore \u2192 again net 2\u00b734 \u2013 3\u00b721 = +5  \n\nTotal result after three plays: \u20137 +5 = \u20132 value so far. \n\nScores on the board (after the last acceptance)\n\u2003Wheat 15, Wood 20, Sheep 8, Brick 13, Ore 9\n\nQuick diagnosis\n- Ore went 8\u21929 (+1) \u2013 nice but well short of the nine of them I\u2019d love to end with.\n- Brick dipped from 14\u219213. I regard this as tolerable if it is the \u201cchange\u201d I pay to escape heavy Brick weight and buy high-end Ore.\n- Wheat/wood bled mercilessly; I need to stem that leak.\n- Sheep never budged \u2013 eight is comfortable, but valued solidly, so holding is fine.\n\nStrategy for the remaining eight moves:\n\n1. If I must give up value tiers, I\u2019d rather give up Wheat or Wood before anything else.  \n2. If I can buy more Ore for Wheat/Wood, do it; Brick \u2192 Ore 2:3 is already as good as it ever gets against a value sheet (doing 2 instead of 1 Ore per Brick); do not spend Brick directly any more except to flip into guaranteed Ore.  \n3. Sheep becomes expendable only if someone offers Ore 1:1 or better; I will ignore all sub-Ore Sheep-bids.  \n4. Track round count. Each Wheat-card sitting in my palm is 6 \u201cdead\u201d value, but each is also cheap to bargain with. I plan to expend at least two Wheat per round unless a better asymmetric trade (Wood/Brick for Ore) presents itself.\n\nWith that behind me, here is my next (and final) programmed move:\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
