From their first trade, Player 0 appears to value Wheat and Sheep and may be willing to part with Brick at a favorable rate. Since Brick has a high value of 28 per unit, increasing my Brick holdings would boost my total value if I can acquire it efficiently.\n\nI want to make an offer that:\n- Uses my lower-value resources (Wheat and Sheep) along with a moderate amount of Wood to avoid depleting it.\n- Targets 10 Brick from Player 0, as they demonstrated willingness to trade it previously.\n- Ensures net value gain for me.\n\nThe proposed offer:  \n- **I give:** 7 Wheat, 2 Wood, 3 Sheep  \n  (Value: 7\u00d75 = 35, 2\u00d711 = 22, 3\u00d712 = 36; total given = 93)  \n- **I request:** 10 Brick  \n  (Value: 10\u00d728 = 280)  \n- **Net gain for me:** 280 - 93 = 187 value increase.\n\nThis is attractive for Player 0 because they may value Wheat, Wood, and Sheep as they did in the first trade, and it mirrors their initial offer but with slightly more resource value from me (93 vs. the first trade's 82) to encourage acceptance. After this trade, I would still have adequate Wheat (7 left), Wood (3 left), and Sheep (8 left), while Brick would rise to 36, pushing my total value substantially higher.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat, 2 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 10 Brick]",
