I need to make a new offer that is more appealing to them, while still increasing the total value of my resources.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. My goal is to increase my total value.\n\nMy current resources and values:\n*   Wheat: 17 * 5 = 85\n*   Wood: 15 * 8 = 120\n*   Sheep: 12 * 16 = 192\n*   Brick: 18 * 20 = 360\n*   Ore: 10 * 35 = 350\nTotal Value: 85 + 120 + 192 + 360 + 350 = 1107\n\nIn the last offer, I offered:\n2 Sheep (2 * 16 = 32)\n2 Ore (2 * 35 = 70)\nTotal offered value: 102\n\nI requested:\n5 Brick (5 * 20 = 100)\n1 Wheat (1 * 5 = 5)\nTotal requested value: 105\n\nThe previous offer was slightly in my favor in terms of value (105 requested for 102 offered). Player 1 might have more of the resources I'm requesting, or they might value theirs more highly.\n\nLet's try to offer something that might be more appealing to Player 1, perhaps by offering more value or resources that are less common, and requesting resources I value highly (like Ore or Brick) or need to balance my inventory.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat and Brick. Ore is my most valuable resource.\n\nLet's consider offering some of my high quantity resources (Wheat, Brick) for high-value resources (Ore, Brick).\n\nNew Offer Idea:\nMaybe Player 1 wants some building materials (Wood, Brick) or wants to get rid of some Ore they might have.\n\nAlternative 1: Offer more Wheat/Sheep for Ore/Brick, potentially making the offer slightly more balanced or even slightly in their favor on paper to encourage acceptance, as long as it benefits me significantly.\n\nLet's try to offer some of my cheaper resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) for more valuable ones (Ore, Brick).\n\nIf I give up some Sheep and a little Ore for more Brick, that's still a good trade for me, assuming I get more value.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, as it's the highest value resource. What would I be willing to give for Ore?\nMaybe I can offer Wheat and Sheep for Ore and Brick.\n\nLet's try this:\nOffer: 3 Sheep, 5 Wheat\nValue Offered: (3 * 16) + (5 * 5) = 48 + 25 = 73\n\nRequest: 2 Ore, 1 Brick\nValue Requested: (2 * 35) + (1 * 20) = 70 + 20 = 90\n\nThis is a good value increase for me (90 requested for 73 offered).
