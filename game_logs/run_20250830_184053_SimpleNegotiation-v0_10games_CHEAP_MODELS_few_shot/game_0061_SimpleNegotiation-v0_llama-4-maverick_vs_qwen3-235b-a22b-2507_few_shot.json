      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to analyze the current situation and plan my trades accordingly. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of my current resources:\n- Wheat: 22 * 6 = 132\n- Wood: 6 * 12 = 72\n- Sheep: 20 * 16 = 320\n- Brick: 10 * 20 = 200\n- Ore: 11 * 36 = 396\n\nTotal value = 132 + 72 + 320 + 200 + 396 = 1120\n\nMy goal is to increase this total value through trades.\n\nTo start, I'll think about what resources are valuable and what I might be able to trade for something more valuable. I have a good quantity of Sheep (20) and Ore (11), which are relatively valuable. I also have a decent amount of Brick (10).\n\nFor my first move, I'll think about offering something that might be attractive to my opponent while requesting something that could increase my total value. One strategy could be to offer some of my less valuable resources or those that I have in abundance relative to their value, in exchange for resources that are more valuable or that I lack.\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (since it's one of the less valuable resources per unit) or possibly some Sheep, as I have a substantial quantity of Sheep. However, Sheep is quite valuable, so I'll be cautious about how much I offer.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering Wheat and/or some other resource for something of higher value. Let's say I offer 4 Wheat (which is relatively less valuable) and some other resource for something more valuable.\n\nHowever, I should directly examine the values and quantities. Noting that Brick and Ore are quite valuable, and I already have a good amount of Ore, I might consider trading some of my less valuable resources for more Brick or Ore, or for something that could be used to get more of these.\n\nFor the first turn, a potential offer could be: \n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\n\nThis offer gives away 4 Wheat (value = 4 * 6 = 24) and 1 Sheep (value = 16), totaling a value of 40, in exchange for 2 Ore (value = 2 * 36 = 72). This is a gain of 72 - 40 = 32 in total value.\n\nSo, my first action is: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

Given that Player 1 made no new offer and our last offer was accepted, we need to analyze our current resources and think about what we can offer or request that might be beneficial.\n\n### Potential Trades\n\nTo increase our total value, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Currently, we have a good amount of [Sheep] (Value: 16) and [Ore] (Value: 36), but we might be able to trade some of our lower-value resources or excess resources for something more valuable.\n\n### New Offer\n\nWe can see that [Ore] is quite valuable. However, we have already increased our [Ore] quantity. Let's consider trading some of our less valuable resources for something more valuable. \n\nLet's form a new offer:  \n- We can offer 3 [Wheat] (Value: 6) and 1 [Sheep] (Value: 16) for 1 [Ore] (Value: 36).  \n- The total value offered is (3*6) + (1*16) = 18 + 16 = 34.  \n- The total value requested is 1*36 = 36.\n\nThis seems like a potentially good trade as we are gaining value (36 - 34 = 2).\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's wait for Player 1's response.",

The total value given is 70, and the total value received is 180, making it a beneficial trade.\n\n## Step 3: Decide on the Action\nSince the trade is beneficial, we should accept the offer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Accept]}$",
