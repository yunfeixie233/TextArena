Specifically, trading 1 Ore (36 value) for 6 Wood (48 value) gives me a net gain of 12 overall value. This trade is strategic as it leverages my abundance of Ore and could appeal to an opponent by offering a high-demand resource like Ore in exchange for Wood, which may be more readily available or less valued by Player 0.\n\nI propose the following offer:\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 6 Wood]",
