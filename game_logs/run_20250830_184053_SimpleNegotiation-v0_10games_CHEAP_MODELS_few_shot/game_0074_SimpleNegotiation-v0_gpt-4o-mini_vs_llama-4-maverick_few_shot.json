I gained 13 units of value, which is a positive outcome.\n\nSince Player 0 made no new trade offer, I will analyze my resources again and consider making a new offer.\n\n### Resource Analysis\n\n1. **Highest Value Resources**: Ore (38) and Brick (20) are my most valuable resources.\n2. **Lower Value Resources**: Wheat (6) is my least valuable resource.\n\n### Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value, I should try to trade away lower-value resources for higher-value ones or maintain the quantity of high-value resources if possible.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n\nI have Wheat and Wood as relatively lower-value resources compared to others. I can try to trade some Wheat or Wood for Sheep, Brick, or Ore if possible.\n\nLet's consider offering 3 Wheat for 1 Sheep:\n- Giving away 3 Wheat (3*6 = 18 value) for 1 Sheep (1*18 = 18 value) doesn't gain value but maintains it. However, considering the quantity, I have plenty of Wheat.\n\nInstead, let's directly propose a trade that could potentially increase my total value.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nI will make an offer to trade 4 Wheat for 1 Ore:\n- **[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]**\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n- Giving away 4 Wheat: 4 * 6 = 24\n- Receiving 1 Ore: 1 * 38 = 38\n\nThis trade increases my total value by 14 (38 - 24).\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's see how Player 0 responds.",

      "response": "### Current Resources and Values\n\nAfter the last trade, the resources and their values are as follows:\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 15 (20 - 2 - 3), Value: 6\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 12 (13 - 1), Value: 11\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 12 (11 + 2), Value: 18\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 24, Value: 20\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 26 (25 + 1), Value: 38\n\n### Evaluating the Current Situation\n\n1. **Total Value Calculation**:\n   - Wheat: 15 * 6 = 90\n   - Wood: 12 * 11 = 132\n   - Sheep: 12 * 18 = 216\n   - Brick: 24 * 20 = 480\n   - Ore: 26 * 38 = 988\n   - **Total Value**: 90 + 132 + 216 + 480 + 988 = 1906\n\n2. **Previous Trades and Outcomes**:\n   - Player 0 initially offered: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep. Rejected.\n   - Player 1 then offered: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep. Accepted.\n   - Subsequent offers by Player 1 were: \n     - 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore (Rejected)\n     - 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep (Rejected)\n     - 1 Wood -> 1 Ore (Accepted)\n\n3. **Game State**:\n   - Turn: The game is ongoing, and it's not specified which turn it is, but based on the history, we can infer it's at least the 5th turn due to the sequence of actions described.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n\nGiven the current resources and the history of trades, we need to strategize the next move:\n\n1. **Identify Valuable Trades**:\n   - We have a good amount of Ore (26), which is highly valued. Trading away some less valuable resources for more valuable ones or maintaining the current valuable resources is key.\n   - We have a relatively balanced portfolio but could benefit from acquiring more high-value resources.\n\n2. **Potential Trades**:\n   - Consider offering some Wheat (low value) or Brick (abundant but high value) for more Ore or other high-value resources.\n   - Since Ore is very valuable and we have a good amount, consider if there's a trade that can slightly improve our position without giving away too much Ore.\n\n3. **Specific Trade Offer**:\n   - One potential trade could involve offering some Brick (since we have a lot and it's valuable) for more Sheep or Ore. However, we need to be cautious not to flood the market with our resources without getting sufficient value back.\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nLet's make a trade offer that involves giving away some Brick for Ore or Sheep, as both are valuable:\n- **[Offer: 4 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]**\n\nThis offer gives away valuable Brick but for a good cause, as it aims to increase our total value by acquiring more Ore or Sheep.\n\n### Action in Required Format\n\n`[Offer: 4 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]`",
