This is not favorable.\n\n3. **Decision on Incoming Offer**: Since the offer is unfavorable (net loss), Player 1 should reject it.\n\n4. **Propose a Counteroffer**: To increase total value, Player 1 should aim to trade away resources where they have excess or lower value for resources like Brick or Ore (highest values). Player 1 has:\n   - Excess Wood (22 units, value 12) compared to other resources.\n   - Excess Sheep (10 units, value 17). Could consider trading some Sheep for Brick or Ore.\n\n5. **Construct a Favorable Offer**: A balanced offer could trade 3 Sheep (3 * 17 = 51 value) for 1 Brick (30 value) and 1 Ore (35 value), totaling 65 value. This gives a net gain of 14 for Player 1. However, this may not be accepted. A more modest offer is 2 Sheep (34 value) for 1 Brick (30 value), a slight loss but possibly acceptable.\n\n6. **Best Practical Offer**: A reasonable offer is 4 Wood (4 * 12 = 48 value) for 1 Brick (30 value) + 1 Sheep (17 value) = 47 value. This is roughly balanced. Alternatively, 2 Sheep (34) for 1 Brick (30) + 1 Wood (12) = 42 (net -8), but this is worse.\n\n7. **Optimal Offer**: The best offer is to trade 3 Wood (36 value) for 1 Brick (30 value), as this is close and Player 1 has excess Wood. This gives -6 value for Player 1, but could be acceptable if Player 0 values Wood highly. Alternatively, 5 Wood (60) for 2 Brick (60) is perfectly balanced.\n\n8. **Final Choice**: Offer 5 Wood for 2 Brick, as it is perfectly balanced in value (60 for 60) and helps Player 1 get more high-value Brick.\n\nFinal action: [Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "Based on my analysis, Wood is extremely low-value for me (only 0.55 per unit) while Ore is my highest-value resource (3.08 per unit). Player 1 has consistently rejected my offers targeting Ore, so I'll shift strategy. Brick is my second-highest value resource at 2.80 per unit, and Player 1 owns Brick (since they've offered it before). \n\n**New Negotiation Approach**:  \nI'll offer **Sheep (1.00/unit) and Wheat (0.75/unit)** for **Brick (2.80/unit)**. Sheep is neutral value for me, and this trade concentrates value into higher-tier resources while offloading surplus. \n\n**Calculating Profit**:  \n- Offering 8 Sheep ($8 value) + 3 Wheat ($2.25 value) \u2192 **Total given: $10.25**  \n- Requesting 4 Brick ($11.20 value) \u2192 **Net gain: $0.95**  \n\n\"Player 1, my earlier Ore-focused offers seem misaligned. Let's try swapping food for construction goods: I'll send a generous bundle of Sheep and Wheat to boost your food supply if you spare 4 Brick. This helps us both balance inventories.\"  \n\n[Offer: 8 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 4 Brick]",
