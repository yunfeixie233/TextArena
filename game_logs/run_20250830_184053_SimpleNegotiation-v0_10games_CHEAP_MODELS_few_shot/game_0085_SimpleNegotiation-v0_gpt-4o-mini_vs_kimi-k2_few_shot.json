Here are a few potential trades to consider based on the values of the resources:\n\n1. **High Value from Ore and Brick**: \n   - Trading some of your high-value Ore for Brick could be beneficial. Since Brick is also relatively high in value, this could leverage an increase in your total value.\n\n2. **Evaluate Excess Sheep**: \n   - You have 10 Sheep. Since they have a good exchange value (17 each), offering some might help to gain other resources with potentially more utility or value.\n\n### Making a Trade Offer\nGiven the relatively high values of Brick and Ore, I suggest the following trade offer:\n\n**Trade Proposal**: \n\n- **Offer**: `[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]`\n\nThis offer aims to exchange 3 Sheep and 2 Ore for 5 Brick and an additional 2 Sheep. The value breakdown is as follows:\n\n- **Offered Resources Value**: \n   - 3 Sheep: 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n   - 2 Ore: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n   - **Total Offered Value**: 51 + 70 = 121\n\n- **Requested Resources Value**: \n   - 5 Brick: 5 \u00d7 26 = 130 \n   - 2 Sheep: 2 \u00d7 17 = 34\n   - **Total Requested Value**: 130 + 34 = 164\n\n### Conclusion\nI'm making the trade offer to my opponent. \n\n**Final Offer**: \n`[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]`",
