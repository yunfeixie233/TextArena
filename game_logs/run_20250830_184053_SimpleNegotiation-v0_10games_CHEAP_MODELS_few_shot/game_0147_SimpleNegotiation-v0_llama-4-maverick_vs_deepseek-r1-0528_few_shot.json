I will start by identifying the resources that are most valuable and those that are less valuable. Ore is the most valuable resource I have, followed by Brick. On the other hand, Wheat is the least valuable.\n\nTo increase the total value, I should try to trade away resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable. Here's a potential trade:\n- I have a lot of Wheat (value 6) and some Wood (value 9), so I could try to trade some of these for more valuable resources.\n\nLet's make an offer to trade some Wheat and Wood for more valuable resources. Since Brick and Ore are highly valued, I'll aim to get more of those if possible.\n\nMy first offer will be:\n`[Offer:4 Wheat,3 Wood -> 2 Brick,1 Ore]`\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (4*6) + (3*9) = 24 + 27 = 51 for resources worth (2*23) + (1*36) = 46 + 36 = 82, which is a good gain.\n\nLet's see how the opponent responds.

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the current situation and the offer made by Player 1.\n\nInitially, you have:\n- Wheat: 14 (Value: 6) = 84\n- Wood: 11 (Value: 9) = 99\n- Sheep: 12 (Value: 15) = 180\n- Brick: 11 (Value: 23) = 253\n- Ore: 16 (Value: 36) = 576\n\nTotal Value = 84 + 99 + 180 + 253 + 576 = 1192\n\nPlayer 1's offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore\n\nLet's analyze the offer:\n- You have 12 Sheep and 16 Ore.\n- If you accept, you'll give 1 Ore (Value: 36) and receive 1 Sheep (Value: 15).\n- The net change in value = 15 (received) - 36 (given) = -21.\n\nAccepting this offer will decrease your total value. Thus, it's not beneficial.\n\nHowever, let's see if we can negotiate a better deal or make a new offer.\n\n## Step 1: Evaluate Player 1's Offer\nPlayer 1 is offering 1 Sheep for 1 Ore. The value of 1 Sheep is 15, and the value of 1 Ore is 36. This is not a good deal for you as it results in a loss of 21 value units.\n\n## Step 2: Consider a Counteroffer\nTo make a beneficial trade, we need to either increase the resources we receive or decrease the resources we offer while keeping the trade appealing to Player 1. \n\n## Step 3: Analyze Resources and Possible Trades\nYou have a surplus of Ore relative to its value compared to other resources like Sheep. You could think of offering Ore for other resources that are more valuable or at least make a fair trade.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a New Offer or Decision\nLet's consider offering 1 Ore for more Sheep or other resources. Since Player 1 is willing to give 1 Sheep for 1 Ore, they might be interested in more Sheep if it means giving more Ore or other valuable resources.\n\n## Step 5: Make a New Offer\nLet's propose: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]. This maintains the ratio but doubles the quantity. It means giving 2*15 = 30 value in Sheep and receiving 2*36 = 72 value in Ore, resulting in a net gain of 42.\n\nGiven that the initial offer from Player 1 was 1 Sheep for 1 Ore, let's try to negotiate a bit better deal.\n\nThe response to Player 1's offer could be a counteroffer: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

We are rich in Ore, so offering Ore could be a good start. However, we need to be cautious not to give away too much value.\n\n## Step 4: Propose a New Offer\nOne strategy is to offer something of relatively lower value in exchange for something of higher value or equal value but beneficial to us.\n\nFor example, offering some Wheat or Wood (lower value resources) for Brick (higher value than Wood and Wheat) could be a good trade.\n\nLet's consider: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]\n\n- **Value given away:** (5 Wheat * 6) + (2 Wood * 9) = 30 + 18 = 48\n- **Value received:** 3 Brick * 23 = 69\n\nThis seems like a potentially good trade as we gain 21 in value.\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]",

We have tried to trade Wheat and Wood for Brick and Ore.\n2. We have tried to trade Sheep for Ore, offering varying quantities.\n\nGiven that we have rejected the last offer, it's time to make a counteroffer or a new offer. \n\nLet's analyze what we can offer or request:\n- We are rich in Ore but have been trying to get more Brick or Ore in previous trades, which hasn't been successful.\n- The value of Ore is high, so giving it away isn't favorable unless we get something of significantly higher total value in return.\n\nLet's examine if there's a beneficial trade:\n- We could try trading some of our less valuable resources or surplus resources for something more valuable or of higher quantity.\n\nOne potential trade could involve our Wheat or Wood (lower value resources) for more Brick (since Brick is more valuable than both Wheat and Wood). \n\nFor example, we could consider:\n- Offering some Wheat and/or Wood for Brick since Brick is more valuable.\n\nLet's propose a trade:\n- We have Wheat (Value: 6) and Wood (Value: 9), and we could offer some of these for Brick (Value: 23).\n\nAn example offer: \n- '[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Brick]'\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n- We're offering \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\) in value.\n- We're requesting \\(1 \\times 23 = 23\\) in value.\n\nThis isn't a good trade for us as it results in a loss.\n\nHowever, if we adjust the quantity:\n- '[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\nValue calculation:\n- Offering: \\((2 \\times 9) + (1 \\times 6) = 18 + 6 = 24\\)\n- Requesting: \\(1 \\times 23 = 23\\)\n\nStill not very favorable.\n\nLet's directly make a more balanced offer, considering our previous attempts and the values:\n- '[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick]'\n\nValue calculation:\n- Offering: \\((3 \\times 6) + (2 \\times 9) = 18 + 18 = 36\\)\n- Requesting: \\(2 \\times 23 = 46\\)\n\nThis is a slightly more favorable trade, as we're gaining \\(46 - 36 = 10\\) in value.\n\nThus, our action for this turn could be:\n'[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick]'.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick]}$",
