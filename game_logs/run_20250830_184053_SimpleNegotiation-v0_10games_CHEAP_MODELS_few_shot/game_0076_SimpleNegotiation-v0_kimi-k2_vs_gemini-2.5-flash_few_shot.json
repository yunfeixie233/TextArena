I should reduce the quantity of low-value resources I'm giving or increase the high-value resources I'm requesting. \n\n4. **New Offer**: I will reduce the Wood and Wheat given, and slightly adjust the Ore/Brick requested to make it more appealing.

Right now every extra Ore is worth triple every extra Wood. A deal they might swallow is one that leaves them with short but still positive value:\n\nOffer 7 Wood \u2013 the cheapest thing I own lots of \u2013 for 2 Ore (66 value for me) and 1 Sheep (15 for them).  Value shift: I give 77, get 81 \u21d2 \u21914 net, which is acceptable.  From their viewpoint they give 48 O-S value and receive 77 W value \u2026 massive surplus. They might finally accept.\n\nIf they deny, the worst I\u2019m out is 1 turn out of 10.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Sheep]",
