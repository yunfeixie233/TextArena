My current Wheat quantity is 6, and I value it at 6 per unit. So, the value of 10 Wheat to me is 10 * 6 = 60. However, I only have 6 Wheat, so receiving 10 Wheat would increase my quantity to 16. This is a good increase in a resource I value.\n\nThe opponent is requesting 3 Brick. My current Brick quantity is 25, and I value it at 25 per unit. So, the value of 3 Brick to me is 3 * 25 = 75.\n\nFrom my perspective:\nI gain value: 10 Wheat * 6 (my value for Wheat) = 60\nI lose value: 3 Brick * 25 (my value for Brick) = 75\n\nThis offer results in a net loss of 15 value for me (60 - 75 = -15). Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow, I need to make an offer. I want to increase my total value.\nMy goal is to acquire more Ore, as it has the highest value to me (40). I have 17 Ore.\nBrick is also very valuable to me (25), and I have 25 units.\nWheat is the least valuable to me (6), and I only have 6 units. It's a low quantity, but also low value.\n\nLet's try to trade some lower-value resources for higher-value ones, specifically Ore or Brick.\nI have a lot of Sheep (24) and Wood (20), which have values of 16 and 9 respectively. These might be good to trade away.\n\nLet's propose an offer to get some Ore.\nI could offer a combination of Wood and Sheep for Ore and/or Brick.\n\nWhat if I try to get some Ore by offering Sheep and Wood?\nFor example, I could offer 5 Sheep (5 * 16 = 80 value) and 5 Wood (5 * 9 = 45 value), total 125.\nWhat could I get for that? Maybe 3 Ore (3 * 40 = 120 value). This is close to a fair trade for me, slightly in my favor.\n\nLet's try a different approach, given I have low Wheat (6) and low initial value for it. This isn't a resource I necessarily want more of, given its low value.\n\nLet's focus on offloading Sheep or Wood.\n\nOffer: 5 Sheep, 5 Wood -> 3 Ore\nMy side: 5 Sheep (value 5*16 = 80) + 5 Wood (value 5*9 = 45) = 125\nTheir side: 3 Ore (value 3*40 = 120)\nThis seems like a reasonable offer. I'm trading 125 value for 120 value, which is slightly in their favor based on my valuations, but hopefully appeals to them if they value Sheep/Wood less or Ore more. My goal is to get more Ore, which is my highest value resource.\n\nLet's check quantities. I have 24 Sheep, so 5 is fine. I have 20 Wood, so 5 is fine. I have 17 Ore, so 3 would increase it to 20.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 5 Wood -> 3 Ore]",

This was a good trade for me, getting a high-value resource for lower-value ones.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nI have 25 Brick. Offering 2 Brick (50) for 1 Ore (40) might be reasonable for Player 0, and if accepted, would still increase my total value, even if the individual trade value is slightly negative for me. But the goal is *total* value.\n\nHow about offering Wheat or Wood?\n6 Wheat (36) + 5 Wood (45) = 81. I could try to exchange this for 2 Ore (80).\nThis would deplete my low-value resources and increase my high-value ones.\n\nLet's consider what Player 0 might need. I don't have information about Player 0's inventory.\n\nLet's try an offer that is clearly beneficial for me if accepted, and see if Player 0 takes it.\nI have plenty of Brick. I could offer Brick for Ore.\nValue of 1 Brick = 25. Value of 1 Ore = 40.\nOffering 1 Brick for 1 Ore is amazing for me, highly unlikely to be accepted.\nOffering 2 Brick for 1 Ore (50 -> 40) is also good for me in terms of *total inventory value*, as it gets me a high-value resource.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, since it's the highest value resource.\nI have a good quantity of Sheep, which is a mid-value resource.\n1 Sheep = 16.\nMaybe offer a larger quantity of lower-value resources for a single high-value resource.\nFor example, 3 Sheep (48) for 1 Ore (40). This is a good deal for Player 0. It would increase my Ore quantity and overall resource value.\n\nI will offer some Sheep and Wood for Ore.\nSheep (16), Wood (9).\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]\nValue on my side: 3*16 + 2*9 = 48 + 18 = 66\nValue on their side: 1*40 + 1*25 = 65\nThis is a very balanced trade. It helps me obtain a high value resource (Ore) and maintain my Brick count.\n\nLet's re-evaluate my current inventory strategically.\nWheat: 6 (low)\nWood: 15 (low)\nSheep: 19 (medium)\nBrick: 25 (high)\nOre: 20 (very high)\n\nI want more Ore. I have plenty of Brick. I have moderate Sheep, and plenty of Wood and Wheat.\n\nWhat if Player 0 needs Brick or Sheep?\nI will try to get more Ore by offering a good deal in lower-value resources.\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]\nMy side: 6 * 6 (36) + 5 * 9 (45) = 81\nTheir side: 2 * 40 = 80\nThis sounds like a very fair and balanced offer. It will convert my lowest value resources into high-value Ore. This is beneficial for my overall inventory value.\n\nLet's go with this.\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
