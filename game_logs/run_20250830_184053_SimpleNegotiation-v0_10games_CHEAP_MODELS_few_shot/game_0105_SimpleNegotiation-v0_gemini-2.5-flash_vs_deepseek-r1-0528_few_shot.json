My goal is to increase the total value of my resources.\nThe previous trade was: Player 0 offered 5 Brick for 1 Ore. Player 1 accepted.\nThis means I gave away 5 Brick (5 * 20 = 100 value) and gained 1 Ore (1 * 39 = 39 value). This was a net loss of 61 value.\nThis was a mistake on my part, I should have offered less Brick or asked for more Ore.\n\nI have an abundance of Brick (12 quantity) and a decent amount of Ore (13 quantity). Sheep and Wood are relatively lower in quantity. Wheat is also in decent quantity.\nOre has the highest value per unit. Brick has a lower value per unit.\n\nI need to make an offer that increases my total value.\nSince Player 1 accepted my previous offer, they might be open to trading Brick for Ore. However, I need to make sure the trade is in my favor.\n\nLet's rethink my strategy. I want to gain more high-value resources like Ore or Sheep, and give away lower-value resources like Brick.\n\nConsidering Player 1's previous acceptance, they might value Brick highly or need it. I need to get more value out of my Brick.\nPerhaps Player 1 has a lot of Wheat or Wood that they are willing to trade for my Brick or Ore.\n\nI will try to trade my Brick for Ore again, but at a more favorable ratio for me. Or I could try to get some Sheep as well.\n\nI will offer Brick for Ore, but at a 3:1 ratio (3 Brick for 1 Ore).\n5 Brick for 1 Ore meant I paid 100 for 39.\n3 Brick for 1 Ore would mean I pay 60 for 39. Still a loss for me.\n\nI need to get more for my Brick, or give less valuable items.\nMaybe I can offer Wheat and Brick for Ore or Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get Sheep. Sheep has a value of 12.\nIf I trade 1 Brick (20) for 1 Sheep (12), I lose value.\nIf I trade 1 Wheat (6) for 1 Sheep (12), I gain value.\n\nMy goal is to increase total value.\nLet's analyze my resources:\n[Wheat]   Qty: 8    Value: 6 (Total: 48)\n[Wood]    Qty: 7    Value: 9 (Total: 63)\n[Sheep]   Qty: 7    Value: 12 (Total: 84)\n[Brick]   Qty: 12   Value: 20 (Total: 240)\n[Ore]     Qty: 13   Value: 39 (Total: 507)\n\nI have a lot of Brick. I want to convert some of it into higher-value items.\nLet's try to get Ore again, but for a smaller amount of Brick. What if I offered 2 Brick for 1 Ore? That's sacrificing 40 value for 39 value, still a tiny loss for me. No good.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore for something I need more of, like Wood or Sheep? But Ore is my most valuable item.\n\nI could try to trade some of my higher quantity items for lower quantity items that have higher value for me.\nI'll try to trade Brick for Sheep at a 1:1 ratio. I give away 20 value and get 12 value. Still bad.\n\nI need to get more value than I give.\nWhat if I try to get Wood?\n1 Brick (20) for 2 Wood (18) is a loss.\n1 Brick (20) for 1 Wood (9) is a huge loss.\n\nPerhaps Player 1 is looking for Brick. I have a lot of it. I should leverage that.\n\nI will offer 2 Brick for 1 Sheep. This is a bad trade for me if Player 1 also has Brick and values it less.\n2 Brick (40) for 1 Ore (39) is a bad deal.\n\nI need to get at least equal or more value than I give.\nConsider the previous trade Player 1 accepted: 5 Brick for 1 Ore.\nThey received 100 value and gave 39 value. They had a huge gain.\n\nI should try to reverse this. I will offer 1 Ore for multiple Brick.\nHowever, I want to keep my Ore as it's the highest value.\n\nLet's try to trade Brick for something else.\nI have 12 Brick. I can spare a few.\nWhat if I offer Brick for Wood? I have 7 Wood.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 3 Wood]\nMy value: 2 Brick * 20 = 40.\nRequested value: 3 Wood * 9 = 27.\nThis is a bad trade for me.\n\nI need to make an offer that nets me value.\nHow about trading Wheat for something else? It's my lowest value resource.\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood]\nMy value: 2 Wheat * 6 = 12.\nRequested value: 1 Wood * 9 = 9.\nThis is a bad trade for me.\n\nOkay, I need to be smarter. I should try to trade what I have in abundance (Brick) for what Player 1 might value highly, that also gives me net value.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 is short on Brick or simply likes it.\nMy Brick value is 20. My Ore value is 39. My Sheep value is 12. My Wood value is 9. My Wheat value is 6.\n\nLet's try to get Sheep.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep]\nMy value: 1 Brick * 20 = 20.\nRequested value: 2 Sheep * 12 = 24.\nThis is again of 4 value! This would be a good trade for me.\nI have 12 Brick, so I can afford this.\n\nLet's try this.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep]",
