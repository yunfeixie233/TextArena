      "response": "### Negotiation Game Analysis\n\n#### Initial Resources and Values\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 24, Value: 6 per unit. Total Value: 24 * 6 = 144\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 11, Value: 10 per unit. Total Value: 11 * 10 = 110\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 12, Value: 13 per unit. Total Value: 12 * 13 = 156\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 15, Value: 24 per unit. Total Value: 15 * 24 = 360\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 18, Value: 32 per unit. Total Value: 18 * 32 = 576\n\nTotal Initial Value: 144 + 110 + 156 + 360 + 576 = 1346\n\n#### Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value of resources, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given the current values:\n\n1. **Highest Value Resources**: Ore (32 per unit) is the highest value resource, followed by Brick (24 per unit).\n2. **Lowest Value Resources**: Wheat (6 per unit) is the lowest value resource.\n\n#### Initial Offer\n\nConsidering the values, a logical initial trade would involve offering resources of lower value in exchange for resources of higher value. \n\nLet's propose a trade that involves giving away some of the lower-value resources to gain higher-value ones. \n\nFor instance, we could offer Wheat (lower value) in exchange for Ore or Brick (higher value). However, we need to be cautious as we have a considerable amount of Ore already.\n\nLet's analyze a potential trade:\n\n- Offer: **[Wheat]** (lower value) in exchange for **[Brick]** or **[Ore]** (higher value).\n\n#### First Turn Action\n\nLet's make an initial offer to see if we can get a better deal. We have plenty of Wheat and could offer some of it for a resource that is more valuable.\n\nExample Offer: `[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Brick]`\n\nThis implies offering 8 units of Wheat (Value: 8 * 6 = 48) for 2 units of Brick (Value: 2 * 24 = 48). This is a value-neutral trade but can be a starting point for negotiation.\n\nLet's adjust the offer slightly to gain more value. \n\nExample Offer: `[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Brick]`\n\nThis implies offering 10 units of Wheat (Value: 10 * 6 = 60) for 3 units of Brick (Value: 3 * 24 = 72), gaining a net value of 12.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n`[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Brick]`\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.",

The current state of my resources is:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 24 - 8 = 16   Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 11   Value: 10\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 12   Value: 13\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 15 + 2 = 17   Value: 24\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 18   Value: 32\n\nThe trade history shows that:\n1. I offered 8 Wheat for 2 Brick, and Player 1 accepted.\n2. I offered 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, and Player 1 rejected.\n\nGiven that Player 1 accepted the first offer but rejected the second, it suggests that they might be looking for Wheat, but there's a limit to how much they're willing to give in return. Since the second offer was rejected, it's possible that the price (5 Wheat for 1 Ore) was not favorable for them.\n\nTo make the next move, let's consider the current values and the previous interactions.\n\n### Potential Next Steps:\n\n1. **Maintain the Status Quo**: Do nothing and wait for Player 1 to make an offer. This could give us more insight into their strategy or needs.\n   \n2. **Make a New Offer**: We need to consider what we can offer that might be attractive to Player 1 while still benefiting us. Since they accepted an offer involving Wheat, we can continue exploring trades involving Wheat.\n\n### Analysis of Resources:\n- We have a relatively high quantity of Wheat (16), and its value is 6. It's not very valuable to us compared to other resources.\n- We have a good amount of Brick (17) after the last trade, and its value is 24. We might not want to give away too much Brick.\n- Ore is very valuable (Value: 32), and we have 18 of it. We were trying to acquire more Ore in the last trade.\n\n### New Offer Consideration:\nLet's consider making an offer that involves Wheat again since Player 1 showed interest in it. However, we need to be cautious about the terms.\n\nAn example of a potential offer could be trading some Wheat for a resource that is valuable to us, like Ore. However, we've already tried to trade Wheat for Ore and were rejected. Let's think about other possibilities.\n\n### Possible Offer:\nLet's make an offer that involves giving away some Wheat (since it's relatively less valuable) and trying to get Ore or another valuable resource.\n\nExample: '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThis is a more conservative offer than the previous one (5 Wheat for 1 Ore), as we're offering less Wheat for the same amount of Ore.\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, -> 1 Ore]' is the action I want to take. \n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'",

I offered 8 Wheat and received 2 Brick.\n   - [Wheat]   Qty: 24 - 8 = 16\n   - [Brick]   Qty: 15 + 2 = 17\n   New value = (16 * 6) + (17 * 24) + (11 * 10) + (12 * 13) + (18 * 32) = 96 + 408 + 110 + 156 + 576 = 1346\n\n2. I offered 3 Wheat and received 1 Ore.\n   - [Wheat]   Qty: 16 - 3 = 13\n   - [Ore]     Qty: 18 + 1 = 19\n   New value = (13 * 6) + (17 * 24) + (11 * 10) + (12 * 13) + (19 * 32) = 78 + 408 + 110 + 156 + 608 = 1360\n\nCurrent total value = 1360\n\nThe current quantity and value of my resources are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 13   Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 11   Value: 10\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 12   Value: 13\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 17   Value: 24\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 19   Value: 32\n\nTo maximize my total value, I should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value with a better ratio. One possible trade could involve offering some Wheat (Value: 6) for other resources.\n\nLet's consider making a new offer:\n- I can offer 2 Wheat (Value: 12) for 1 Brick (Value: 24), which is a good gain.\n- Alternatively, I can offer 1 Sheep (Value: 13) for 1 Ore (Value: 32), but it seems less favorable as I'm giving up a resource of value 13 for one of value 32, which is not a good trade.\n\nConsidering the available resources and values, a reasonable offer could be:\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\n\nThis is my action for this turn.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 1 Brick, 0 Ore]\n\nLet's simplify it according to the given format:\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "Let's analyze the current situation and determine the best course of action for the next turn.\n\n### Current Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: 24 - 8 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 = 2 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 11 (Value: 10)\n- Sheep: 12 (Value: 13)\n- Brick: 15 + 2 = 17 (Value: 24)\n- Ore: 18 + 1 = 19 (Value: 32)\n\n### Previous Offers and Responses:\n1. Offered 8 Wheat for 2 Brick, Accepted.\n2. Offered 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, Rejected.\n3. Offered 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, Rejected.\n4. Offered 3 Wheat for 1 Ore, Accepted.\n5. Offered 2 Wheat for 1 Brick, Rejected.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The opponent is willing to trade Brick and Ore for Wheat, but the rate seems to vary.\n- The last accepted trade was 3 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n- The opponent has shown a preference for Wheat, as they accepted trades involving Wheat.\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven that we are running low on Wheat and the opponent has shown interest in it, we should consider offering something other than Wheat. We should also analyze the value of the resources we are offering and requesting to ensure a beneficial trade.\n\n### Potential Trade:\nLet's consider offering some of our less valuable resources for something more valuable. For example, we could offer some Wood (Value: 10) for a more valuable resource.\n\n### Proposed Trade:\n- Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore\n\nThis trade involves offering 2 Wood (total value = 2 * 10 = 20) for 1 Ore (value = 32). The trade seems beneficial as we are gaining value (32 - 20 = 12).\n\nHowever, let's check if there's a more valuable or reasonable trade we can propose.\n\n### Alternative Trade:\n- Offer: 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick\n\nSheep (Value: 13) is less valuable than Brick (Value: 24). Offering 1 Sheep for 2 Brick could be a good trade as it increases our total value.\n\n### Decision:\nLet's propose: [Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick]\n\nThis combines the idea of trading less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nThe response should be: [Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick]",
