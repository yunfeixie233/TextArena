Receiving 2 Sheep (2 \u00d7 17 = 34 value) results in a net gain of +2 value for me.  \n- **Opponent incentive**: If the opponent values Wheat and Wood for their utility or has excess Sheep, this trade could address their needs while being value-close (32 vs. 34), making it potentially acceptable.  \n\nThis offer optimizes my resource value with minimal risk.
