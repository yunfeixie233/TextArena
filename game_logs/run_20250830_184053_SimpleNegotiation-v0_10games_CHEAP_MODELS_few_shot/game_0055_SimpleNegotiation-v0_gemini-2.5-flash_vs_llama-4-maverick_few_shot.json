      "response": "To evaluate the offer made by Player 0, let's first calculate the value of the resources being offered and requested.\n\nPlayer 0 is offering: 5 Wheat\n- The value of Wheat is 5, so 5 Wheat = 5 * 5 = 25\n\nPlayer 0 is requesting: 2 Ore\n- The value of Ore is 35, so 2 Ore = 2 * 35 = 70\n\nThe offer is: [5 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\n\nTo assess this trade, let's compare the values:\n- You are giving up 2 Ore, valued at 70.\n- You are receiving 5 Wheat, valued at 25.\n\nSince 70 (value of what you're giving) is greater than 25 (value of what you're getting), this trade is not in your favor.\n\nLet's formulate a response based on the game's instructions and the available tokens.\n\nGiven that the offer is not beneficial, you should deny it. The default action is '[Deny]', so you don't need to explicitly state it unless you want to make a counteroffer or accept.\n\nHowever, to actively respond, you could make a counteroffer. Let's examine your resources and consider a trade that could be beneficial.\n\nYou have:\n- Wheat: 10 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 12 (Value: 8)\n- Sheep: 25 (Value: 12)\n- Brick: 12 (Value: 27)\n- Ore: 9 (Value: 35)\n\nA potential counteroffer should involve resources that you have in surplus or those that are less valuable to you, in exchange for something more valuable.\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat or Wood (since they are less valuable) for something more valuable like Ore or Brick.\n\nFor example, you could offer 5 Wood (valued at 8 each, so 5*8 = 40) for 1 Ore (valued at 35). Although this isn't a great trade for you either, it's closer to being neutral. However, you might want to aim for a slightly better deal.\n\nLet's directly make a counteroffer that could be reasonable:\nYou have 10 Wheat, and offering some of it for a more valuable resource could be a good start.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis translates to: '[Offer: 4 Wheat, 0 Other Resources -> 1 Ore]'\n\nSo, the action in the required format is:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'",
