Giving 4 Sheep and 1 Wood totals **75** (64 + 11). Receiving 4 Brick (valued at 29 each) gives **116**. This results in a net gain of **41** value points.  \n- **Benefit to Player 1**:  \n  Based on past acceptances of Sheep-for-Brick trades (e.g., 5 Sheep for 3 Brick), Player 1 likely values Sheep highly. Offering 4 Sheep at a slightly better rate (with added Wood) may entice acceptance while still maximizing our value.  \n- **Resource Management**:  \n  We retain ample Brick (13 \u2192 17) and Ore (18) while reducing lower semi-valued assets. Wood (7 \u2192 6) and Sheep (4 \u2192 0) are less critical given their lower per-unit value.  \n\nThis offer optimizes our position without overextending scarce resources. If accepted, our total value rises to 1219\u2014strengthening our end-game score.  \n\n*Proposed trade:*  \n**Offering**: 4 Sheep, 1 Wood  \n**Requesting**: 4 Brick",
