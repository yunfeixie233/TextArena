I offered 5 Sheep (value 60) for 2 Ore (value 74). This would have increased my value by 14.\n\nPlayer 1 made no new trade offer.\n\nLet's try to offer a better deal for Player 1, or try to get something cheaper from them.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat, which has a low value. I also have a decent amount of Brick, which has a higher value. Ore is my most valuable resource.\n\nLet's try to trade some Wheat for something more valuable. I have 24 Wheat (value 144).\n\nPerhaps I can offer a larger quantity of lower-value resources for a smaller quantity of higher-value resources.\n\nHow about offering Wheat for Sheep or Wood?\nWheat (value 6), Wood (value 10), Sheep (value 12), Brick (value 22), Ore (value 37).\n\nLet's try to get Ore again, as it's the most valuable.\n\nI could try to offer Brick for Ore, as Brick is also valuable, but less than Ore.\nOffer 1 Brick (value 22) for 1 Ore (value 37). This is a good deal for me.\nBut Player 1 will probably not accept that.\n\nLet's think about what Player 1 might want. I don't know Player 1's resources.\n\nI will try to offer something with a higher value to get a slightly higher value in return.\nLet's offer some Brick for Ore again, but maybe more Brick to entice them.\n\nOffer: 2 Brick (value 44) for 1 Ore (value 37). This is not good for me as I am decreasing my total value.\n\nI must increase my total value.\nSo Requested Resources total value must be greater than Offered Resources total value.\n\nLet's reconsider the ratio between my resources.\nI have plenty of Wheat. I will try to offer a substantial amount of Wheat for something more valuable.\nWhat if I offer 5 Wheat (value 30) for 1 Brick (value 22)? This is a bad deal for me.\n\nI need to offer less value than I receive.\n\nLet's try to offer a mix of sheep and wheat for Ore.\nOffer: 3 Sheep (value 36) + 5 Wheat (value 30) = 66\nRequest: 2 Ore (value 74)\nThis would increase my value by 8.\n\nLet's try a simpler offer first.\nOffer Wheat for a more valuable resource.\n\nOffer: 8 Wheat (value 48) for 2 Brick (value 44). This is a bad deal for me.\n\nI need to make sure the value of what I'm getting is higher than what I'm giving.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again.\nOffer: 3 Sheep (value 36) for 1 Ore (value 37).\nThis is a good deal for me, as I gain 1 value point. Player 1 just rejected 5 Sheep for 2 Ore. This is a slightly better ratio for Player 1 (3 Sheep for 1 Ore is 36 value offered for 37 value gained). The previous one was 5 Sheep (60) for 2 Ore (74), meaning 30 per Ore vs 36 per Ore. This is worse for Player 1 by the way. My initial proposal was: Offer 5 Sheep (value 60) for 2 Ore (value 74) which is 30 value for 1 Ore vs 37 value for 1 Ore. So 5 Sheep is 2.5 Sheep/Ore. Now I propose 3 Sheep for 1 Ore, which is 3 Sheep/Ore. This is still not enticing for Player 1.\n\nI need to offer something that is *more* attractive to Player 1, or at least a good value for me while still being acceptable for Player 1.\n\nLet's think about offers that Player 1 might *want* from my current resources, while still benefiting me.\n\nWhat if I offer some valuable resource (like Ore or Brick) for a resource I have in abundance (like Wheat)? This would be bad for me generally.\n\nOkay, let's try to offer something that benefits me significantly, and see if Player 1 accepts it.\nI have a lot of Wheat. Let's try to trade a significant amount of Wheat for something with higher value.\n\nOffer: 10 Wheat (value 60) for 2 Brick (value 44). Still a bad deal for me.\n\nThe format is `[Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]`\n\nI want to offer a quantity of low-value resource for a smaller quantity of a high-value resource.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat for Sheep.\nOffer: 3 Wheat (value 18) for 2 Sheep (value 24).\nThis is a good deal for me, gaining 6 value. It's offering a lot of low-value Wheat for some Sheep. Player 1's resources are unknown, but Sheep is a common resource.\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]",
