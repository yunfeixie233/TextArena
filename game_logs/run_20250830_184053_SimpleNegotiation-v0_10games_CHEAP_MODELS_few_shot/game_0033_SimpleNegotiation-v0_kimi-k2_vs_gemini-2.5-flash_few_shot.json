      "response": "Let\u2019s look at tonight\u2019s situation first.  \nOpponent keeps repeating the same proposal: 2 Sheep \u2194 1 Ore + 1 Wood.  \nFrom my standpoint that is:\n\n\u2022 I would give away 35 (Ore) + 8 (Wood) = 43 value  \n\u2022 I would receive       14 \u00d7 2 = 28 value  \nNet loss of 15 value \u2013 clearly unacceptable.\n\nPrevious offers from my side have all been rejected, so the last thing\nI know about Player 1 is that they probably value Ore very highly and\nvalue Wheat/Wood rather low.  I still want more Ore if I can get it at\nan acceptable rate.\n\nMy cards:\n- Wheat: 10 (value 5 each)  \n- Wood: 25 (value 8 each)  \n- Sheep: 15 (value 14 each)  \n- Brick: 17 (value 27 each)  \n- Ore:   14 (value 35 each)\n\nMission: package some of my low-value Wheat/Wood/Sheep in a way that\nis AT LEAST as good for Player 1 as their last rejected proposal,\nwhile still improving my own total value.\n\nLet\u2019s test.\n\nA.  Give 3 Sheep (value 42) and ask for 2 Ore (value 70).  \n   Net value +28 for me and +28 compared to what they would have\n   received from the 2 Sheep/1Ore+1Wood offer (28 vs 28).  \n   This is exactly the same benefit to Player 1 they already turned\n   down \u2013 so I fear it will be turned down again.\n\nB.  Give 10 Wheat (50) + 6 Wood (48) = 98 value  \n   Ask for 3 Ore (105) = 7 value surplus.  \n   That move hurts me \u2013 avoid.\n\nC.  Give 3 Brick (81) for 2 Ore (70).  \n   Net \u201311 value for me \u2013 avoid.\n\nD.  Give 4 Sheep (56) for 3 Ore (105).  \n   Net +49 for me, but gives opponent only 56 value instead of 64\n   from previous proposals \u2013 almost certain rejection.\n\nE.  Must increase the goodies the opponent gets WITHOUT pushing me\n   into the red.  Add low-value cards:\n\n   Offer 5 Wheat (25) + 3 Wood (24) + 3 Sheep (42) = 91  \n   Ask for 4 Ore (140)\n\n   That yields +49 for me while giving the opponent almost the same\n   total value (91) they could have had from their last 2S\u21921O+1W\n   trade after doing it twice (2\u00d728 = 56), yet I cover them all in\n   one shot.  Betters their value and keeps me green.\n\nBut I am required to keep my response short on the thought process; the\noffer itself is enough.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 4 Ore]",
