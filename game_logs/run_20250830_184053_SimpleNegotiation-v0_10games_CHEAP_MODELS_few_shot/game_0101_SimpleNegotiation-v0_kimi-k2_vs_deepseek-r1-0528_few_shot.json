I should try to acquire more Wood if the trade is favorable.\n   - I have excess Brick (value 27) and some Sheep (value 14) which I can use to trade for higher-value resources like Ore (value 40) or Wood (value 9).\n   - Player 1 may now have Wood and Wheat (they gave up Ore and Brick in the last trade). I should offer a trade that gives them Brick or Sheep in exchange for Wood or Ore.\n\n3. **Trade Proposal**:\n   - Offer to give 5 Brick (value 27 * 5 = 135) for 4 Ore (value 40 * 4 = 160). This is a good deal for me as I gain 25 in value.\n   - Alternatively, offer 3 Sheep (14 * 3 = 42) for 5 Wood (9 * 5 = 45), gaining 3 in value.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - The first trade (5 Brick for 4 Ore) is better (net gain of 25 vs. 3).
