      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n- Current resources and their values:\n  - [Wheat]: 6, Value: 6\n  - [Wood]: 19, Value: 12\n  - [Sheep]: 24, Value: 12\n  - [Brick]: 22, Value: 21\n  - [Ore]: 12, Value: 34\n\n### Negotiation Strategy\nTo maximize the total value of resources, we need to identify which resources are more valuable and try to accumulate more of those. The current total value is (6 + 12 + 12*2 + 21*2 + 34*2) = 6 + 12 + 24 + 42 + 68 = 152.\n\nThe most valuable resources are Ore (34 per unit) and Brick (21 per unit). We should aim to accumulate more of these if possible.\n\n### Initial Offer Consideration\nLet's examine potential trades that could increase our total value:\n1. We have a surplus of Sheep (24) and Wood (19), which are relatively less valuable compared to Ore and Brick. We could offer some of these to get more Ore or Brick.\n\n### First Turn Action\nConsidering the resources we have and their values, a reasonable initial offer could involve trading some of our less valuable resources for more valuable ones. \n\nLet's propose: `[Offer: 5 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]`.\n\nThis offer gives away:\n- 5 Sheep = 5 * 2 = 10 value (since Sheep is worth 12/24 = 0.5 per unit, but we are considering it as 2 units for simplicity in relative value comparison, the actual value per Sheep is 12/24 = 0.5)\n- 3 Wood = 3 * (12/19) = approximately 1.89 value per unit, so 3 Wood = 3 * 0.63 = 1.89 (but we'll consider the total value directly)\n\nIn exchange for:\n- 2 Ore = 2 * 34 = 68 value\n- 1 Brick = 1 * 21 = 21 value\n\nTotal value given away = (5 * 0.5) + (3 * 12/19) = 2.5 + 1.89 = 4.39 (using the actual quantity and value per unit for calculation: 5 Sheep = 5, 3 Wood = 3 * (12/19))\nTotal value received = 2 * 34 + 1 * 21 = 68 + 21 = 89\n\nThis seems like a beneficial trade.\n\n### Action\n`[Offer: 5 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]`",
