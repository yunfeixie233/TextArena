Ore has almost the same unit value but I have plenty (10). In Catan-style trading, both brick and ore usually have eager buyers. The card that feels \u201cover-weighted\u201d is **sheep** (18 value for 11 units) when compared to Wheat (low score but only 8 units). Thus, sheep or ore seem like good candidates to ship out if I can snag more brick.\n\nI open with an exploratory proposal that looks generous for brick-hungry players, yet improves my own value by locking in the high-value brick:\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Ore \u2192 4 Brick, 1 Sheep]\n\nThat is, I give up 4 Sheep and 2 Ore, keep 7 Sheep afterwards, and net **three additional brick**.\n\nQuick delta to my own future holdings if accepted:  \n- Give away 4\u22c51.64 + 2\u22c54 = 18.56 value  \n- Receive 4\u22c54.2 + 1\u22c51.64 = 18.44 value  \n\nSo the offer is essentially value-neutral in the short term, but it turns two \u201caverage\u201d resources into red-hot brick and keeps my brick count rising toward 9. Over the coming turns I expect to swap duplicate brick for anything scarce my opponent brings up, or to simply use the high-value brick as leverage.\n\nVoice:  \n\u201cLooking for brick upgrades over here. I\u2019m offering 4 Sheep plus 2 Ore for any 4 Brick you can spare\u2014sweet deal for both sides since you stay at five brick while I climb. Any takers?\u201d\n\n(Waiting for response \u2026)",
