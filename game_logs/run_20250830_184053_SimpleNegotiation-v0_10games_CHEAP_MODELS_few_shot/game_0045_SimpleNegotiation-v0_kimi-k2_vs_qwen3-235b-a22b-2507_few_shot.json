      "response": "Let me review what has happened so far.\n\n- Turns 1 & 2: I exchanged a few messages, then proposed  \n  (3 Wheat, 2 Wood \u2192 2 Brick).  \n  Was rejected.\n\n- Turns 3 & 4: I proposed  \n  (5 Wheat, 3 Wood, 3 Sheep \u2192 6 Brick).  \n  Again rejected.\n\nObservations  \n1. I start with only 9 Brick, and Brick is worth 21 apiece\u2014by far my best-per-unit resource, so gaining more is the quickest way to raise total value.  \n2. Player 1 never counter-offers, so I must deduce acceptable ratios from rejections.  \n3. Brick is my scarcest resource, so the opponent may value it higher than Brick\u2019s intrinsic 21\u2014thus I need to over-pay.  \n4. The ratio that did NOT work was roughly  \n   0.75 Brick / 1 Wood & 1 Wheat or 1.5 Brick / (1 Wheat + 1 Wood + 1 Sheep).  \n\nA generous but still value-positive offer for me:\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood, 4 Sheep -> 8 Brick]\n\nThat gives them a huge raise in quantity: 14 resources for 8 Brick.  \nThe face value ratio is 14 resources for 168 value (8 \u00d7 21), while my offered bundle at market prices is only (6\u00d76 + 4\u00d710 + 4\u00d715) = 36 + 40 + 60 = 136.  \nSo, accepting gives Player 1 a 32-value surplus over what they give up.  \nFor me, the trade moves value from lower-ticket goods to higher-ticket Brick, raising total value for both sides\u2014precisely what the game is about.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood, 4 Sheep -> 8 Brick]",
