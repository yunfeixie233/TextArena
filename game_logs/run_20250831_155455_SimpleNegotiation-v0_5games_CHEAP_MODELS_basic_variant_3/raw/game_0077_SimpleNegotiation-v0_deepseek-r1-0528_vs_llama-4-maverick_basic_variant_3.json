      "response": "To evaluate the offer made by Player 0, let's first analyze the proposed exchange and the current state of my resources.\n\nThe offer is: 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep\n\n- Value of 1 Brick = 28\n- Value of 3 Sheep = 3 * 14 = 42\n\nSince 42 (value of what I'm asked to give) is greater than 28 (value of what I receive), accepting this trade would decrease the overall worth of my resource collection.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that could be beneficial.\n\nCurrent quantities and values:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 11   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 14   Value: 12\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 22   Value: 14\n- [Brick]   Qty: 15   Value: 28\n- [Ore]     Qty: 7    Value: 38\n\nTo make a smart trade, I should look for an opportunity where I can exchange resources in a way that either maintains or increases the total value.\n\nGiven that Player 0 is willing to trade Brick (Value: 28) for Sheep (Value: 14), it indicates they might be interested in Sheep or have a surplus of Brick. Let's think of a counteroffer.\n\nIf I offer them something they might be willing to accept in return for a resource I need, it could be beneficial. One possible trade could involve giving them Wheat (low value) or Sheep (since they're already trading for Sheep) and getting something more valuable in return.\n\nHowever, my Sheep are relatively valuable to them (as seen from their initial offer), and I shouldn't give away too many. Let's directly analyze making a counteroffer using the format provided.\n\nLet's propose a trade that gives them something of moderate value in exchange for a resource I need.\n\nConsidering my resources and the initial offer, a possible counteroffer is:\n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\n\n- Value of 4 Sheep = 4 * 14 = 56\n- Value of 2 Brick = 2 * 28 = 56\n\nThis is a fair trade in terms of value, as it maintains the overall worth.\n\nHowever, I can adjust the quantities to gain a slight advantage or make it more appealing.\n\nLet's directly make a counteroffer:\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\n\n- Value of 2 Sheep = 2 * 14 = 28\n- Value of 1 Wheat = 1 * 5 = 5\n- Total value given = 28 + 5 = 33\n- Value of 1 Brick = 28\n\nThis trade is slightly unfavorable to me due to the higher total value I'm offering. Let's adjust it.\n\nA more balanced or slightly favorable trade could be:\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\n\n- Value of 1 Sheep = 1 * 14 = 14\n- Value of 1 Brick = 1 * 28 = 28\n\nThis trade increases my collection's value.\n\nThus, my response will be:\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",

Using it for a trade might not be the best unless we get something of significantly higher total value.\n\nLet's consider proposing a trade that involves Wheat since it's the least valuable resource and we have a moderate quantity of it.\n\nIf we offer 4 Wheat (total value = 4*5 = 20) and request 1 Wood (total value = 1*12 = 12), it doesn't seem like a good trade because we're giving away more value than we're getting (though not by much, but still not beneficial).

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the current state of resources and the recent trades.\n\nInitial Resources:\n- Wheat: 11 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 14 (Value: 12)\n- Sheep: 22 (Value: 14)\n- Brick: 15 (Value: 28)\n- Ore: 7 (Value: 38)\n\nAfter the trades:\n1. Initially, Player 0 offered 1 Brick for 3 Sheep. We rejected it.\n2. Then, we offered 4 Sheep for 2 Brick. Accepted. So, we lost 4 Sheep and gained 2 Brick.\n   - Sheep: 22 - 4 = 18\n   - Brick: 15 + 2 = 17\n3. We offered 5 Sheep for 1 Ore. Accepted. So, we lost 5 Sheep and gained 1 Ore.\n   - Sheep: 18 - 5 = 13\n   - Ore: 7 + 1 = 8\n4. We offered 3 Wheat for 1 Brick. Rejected.\n5. Player 0 offered 1 Wheat for 1 Wood. We rejected it.\n6. No new trades were made by either party in the next turn.\n7. Now, Player 0 offers 5 Wheat for 4 Wood.\n\nCurrent state after previous trades:\n- Wheat: 11 - 3 = 8 (since we offered 3 Wheat but it was rejected, the quantity remains the same as we didn't actually lose the Wheat)\n- Wood: 14\n- Sheep: 13\n- Brick: 17\n- Ore: 8\n\nLet's adjust the quantities according to the actual trades made:\n- After giving 4 Sheep and getting 2 Brick: Sheep = 18, Brick = 17\n- After giving 5 Sheep and getting 1 Ore: Sheep = 13, Ore = 8\n\nSo, the actual current state is:\n- Wheat: 11\n- Wood: 14\n- Sheep: 13\n- Brick: 17\n- Ore: 8\n\nConsidering the new offer: 5 Wheat for 4 Wood.\n- We have 11 Wheat, so giving 5 is feasible.\n- We have 14 Wood, so giving 4 is feasible for us if we were on the other side of the trade.\n\nThe offer is for us to give 5 Wheat (Value: 5 each) = 25 total value, and get 4 Wood (Value: 12 each) = 48 total value. This seems like a good trade as we gain value (48 - 25 = 23).\n\nResponse: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 4 Wood]\n\nLet's recheck the command format to ensure it matches the required template: \n[Offer: Items_You_Provide -> Items_You_Request]\n\nThe response in the required format is: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 4 Wood]",
