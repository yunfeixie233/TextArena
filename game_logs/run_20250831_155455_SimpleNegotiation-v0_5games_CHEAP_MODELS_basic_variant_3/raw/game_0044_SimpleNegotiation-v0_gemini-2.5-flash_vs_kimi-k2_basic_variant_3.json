My Sheep quantity is low, but its value is relatively high per unit. Ore and Brick are high-value items, and I have a decent amount of Ore.\n\nMy first offer will aim to convert some of my abundant Wheat and Wood into more valuable Brick or Ore, or potentially more Sheep since I have few. I want to ensure my proposed offers are appealing while still benefiting me significantly.\n\nLet's start with a relatively balanced offer that pushes for higher value items.\n\n[Offer: 12 Wheat, 12 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",
