      "response": "After analyzing my current resource holdings and values, I need to propose a trade that has the potential to increase my overall worth. Although the previous offer of 2 Wheat for 1 Wood was rejected, I suspect Player 1 may want a more favorable exchange to accept. Wheat is a low-value resource for me (5 per unit), and I have a surplus of 25 units. Wood carries a higher value (9 per unit) but I also have a reasonable amount (20 units), so gaining more Wood at a small calculated loss could facilitate future trades for higher-value resources like Ore or Sheep. By offering more Wheat for Wood, I provide Player 1 with an opportunity to gain surplus value, increasing the chances of acceptance.\n\nI propose the following trade to Player 1:\n\n- I will give 5 Wheat (value 5 x 5 = 25).\n- I request 2 Wood (value 9 x 2 = 18).\n\nThis results in a net loss of 7 in total value for me (25 - 18 = -7) but grants Player 1 a net gain of 7. Since Wheat is abundant in my collection, I can absorb this loss and use the additional Wood to potentially negotiate higher-value trades in future turns. The goal is to build goodwill and encourage a more balanced exchange later, while slowly accumulating resources that might yield better opportunities.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Wood]",
