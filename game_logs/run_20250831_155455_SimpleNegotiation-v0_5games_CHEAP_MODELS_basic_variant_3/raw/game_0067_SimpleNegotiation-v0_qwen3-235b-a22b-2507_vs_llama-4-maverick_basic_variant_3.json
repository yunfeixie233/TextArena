      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first assess the current situation and the values involved.\n\n### Current Holdings and Values\n\n1. Wheat: Qty = 21, Value = 5\n2. Wood: Qty = 20, Value = 9\n3. Sheep: Qty = 15, Value = 14\n4. Brick: Qty = 10, Value = 29\n5. Ore: Qty = 12, Value = 40\n\n### Total Value of Current Holdings\n\nTo understand the total value, we multiply the quantity of each resource by its value and sum them up.\n\n- Total Value = (21*5) + (20*9) + (15*14) + (10*29) + (12*40)\n- Total Value = 105 + 180 + 210 + 290 + 480\n- Total Value = 1265\n\n### Analyzing the Previous Offer\n\nPlayer 0 made an offer: `4 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 6 Wood, 2 Brick`\n\nLet's calculate the total value of the items offered and requested:\n\n- Value of items offered by Player 0 = (4*14) + (1*40) = 56 + 40 = 96\n- Value of items requested by Player 0 = (6*9) + (2*29) = 54 + 58 = 112\n\nSince the value of the items requested (112) is greater than the value of the items offered (96), this trade is not favorable for Player 1. Player 1 rejected it, which was a correct decision based on the values.\n\n### Formulating a New Trade Offer\n\nTo make a smart trade, we should look for opportunities that either:\n1. Increase the quantity of higher-value resources.\n2. Maintain or slightly decrease the total quantity of resources while increasing the total value.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n\n1. **Trading lower-value resources for higher-value ones**:\n   - We could offer Wheat (Value = 5) or Wood (Value = 9) for resources like Brick (Value = 29) or Ore (Value = 40).\n\n2. **Example Trade**:\n   - Offering 5 Wheat (Value = 5*5 = 25) and 2 Wood (Value = 2*9 = 18) for 1 Brick (Value = 29) could be considered. Total value given = 25 + 18 = 43, and the value received = 29. This isn't favorable.\n   - A potentially favorable trade could involve offering resources of lower value for Ore or Brick.\n\nLet's propose a trade that could be beneficial or at least neutral in terms of value but beneficial in terms of strategy or resource diversification.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n\nLet's consider offering: `5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore`\n\n- Value of items offered = (5*5) + (3*9) = 25 + 27 = 52\n- Value of 1 Ore = 1*40 = 40\n\nThis trade isn't favorable because we're giving up more value than we're getting.\n\nLet's adjust our strategy and directly propose a trade based on value optimization.\n\n### Alternative Trade\n\nOffer: `[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\n- Value of 2 Sheep = 2*14 = 28\n- Value of 1 Ore = 40\n\nThis trade is favorable because we're getting a resource worth 40 in exchange for resources worth 28, gaining 12 in value.\n\nLet's execute this trade proposal.\n\n`[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\n### Monitoring the Response\n\nWe will wait for Player 0's response to this offer. If they accept, we'll gain 1 Ore, increasing our total value. If they deny, we'll need to reassess and propose another trade.",

We should re-evaluate our resources and consider a different trade that might be more appealing or analyze the potential for a different type of exchange.\n\n#### New Trade Proposal:\nLet's consider offering something that hasn't been proposed yet and might be more appealing. We could offer Ore for Brick since Ore is valuable, and Brick is relatively valuable as well.\n\n#### Proposed Trade:\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]\n\nThis proposal is to exchange 1 Ore (Value: 40) for 2 Brick (Total Value: 2*29 = 58), which increases our Brick quantity and potentially benefits from the trade. \n\n### Command:\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]",
