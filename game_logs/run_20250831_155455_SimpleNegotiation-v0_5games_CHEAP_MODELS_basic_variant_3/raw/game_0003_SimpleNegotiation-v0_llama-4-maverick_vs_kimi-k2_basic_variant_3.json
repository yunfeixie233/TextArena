Given the values, Ore and Brick are the most valuable resources I have, while Wheat is the least valuable.\n\n3. **Proposing a Trade**:\n   I will start by proposing a trade that involves giving away some of my less valuable resources (in relative terms) and acquiring more valuable ones. Since Wheat is the least valuable resource per unit and I have a considerable amount of other resources, I'll consider trading Wheat for something more valuable.\n\n   Let's propose: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n   - This means I'm offering 4 Wheat (total value = 4 * 5 = 20) in exchange for 1 Ore (value = 33).\n   - The net gain in value if accepted would be 33 - 20 = 13.\n\n   Given that Ore is quite valuable and I don't have an abundance of it relative to its value, requesting 1 Ore for 4 Wheat seems like a reasonable starting proposal.\n\n   Thus, my action is: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`.",
