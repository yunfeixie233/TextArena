      "response": "To maximize the value of my resource collection, I will analyze the current quantities and values of the resources I hold and look for opportunities to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or to consolidate resources in a way that could be beneficial.\n\nCurrently, I have:\n- Wheat (Value: 5)\n- Wood (Value: 8)\n- Sheep (Value: 15)\n- Brick (Value: 28)\n- Ore (Value: 39)\n\nThe resources with the highest values are Ore and Brick. I should look to keep or acquire more of these. Conversely, Wheat and Wood have lower values, so it might be beneficial to trade them away if possible.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n\n1. I have a significant quantity of Wheat (21), which is one of the lower-value resources. Trading some Wheat for a resource with a higher value could be beneficial.\n\n2. I also have a considerable amount of Wood (18), another relatively lower-value resource.\n\n3. My Sheep (18) could potentially be traded for something of higher value since Sheep is worth less than Brick and Ore.\n\nLet's propose a trade that could increase the overall worth of my collection. \n\nSince Ore is the highest value resource and I already have a good quantity of it (22), I might not want to give it up. However, I can consider giving away some of the lower-value resources to get more Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's start by offering:\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n\nThis trade involves giving away resources of lower value (Wheat = 5, Wood = 8) to get Brick (Value = 28), which is a higher-value resource. The total value given away is (4*5) + (3*8) = 20 + 24 = 44, and the value received is 1*28 = 28. This isn't a good trade due to the value imbalance.\n\nLet's reconsider and think of a more balanced trade.\n\nI have plenty of Wheat and some Wood, so I could think about trading some of these for Sheep or other higher-value resources.\n\nLet's propose:\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]\n\nHere, I'm giving away 6 Wheat (Value = 5*6 = 30) for 2 Sheep (Value = 15*2 = 30). This trade maintains the value but doesn't increase it. It's not beneficial in terms of increasing the overall worth.\n\nLet's think about another option.\n\nConsidering the high value of Ore and Brick, let's try to get more of either. \n\nLet's propose:\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nHere, I'm giving away (3*8) + (2*15) = 24 + 30 = 54 worth of resources for 1 Ore (Value = 39). This isn't a good trade.\n\nLet's adjust our strategy to be more reasonable and propose a trade that involves giving away lower-value resources for higher ones in a more balanced ratio.\n\nLet's propose:\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n\nIn this trade, I'm giving (4*5) + (2*8) = 20 + 16 = 36 for 1 Brick (Value = 28). This is still not a good trade.\n\nRevisiting, let's directly aim to acquire more Ore or maintain my current high-value resources.\n\nLet's propose a more appealing trade:\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nHere, I'm offering (5*15) = 75 worth of Sheep for 1 Ore (Value = 39). This is not a good trade for me as it results in a loss.\n\nLet's analyze again.\n\nConsidering a more balanced trade:\nIf I offer resources that are not too valuable to me but could be valuable to the other player, it might initiate a beneficial exchange.\n\nLet's think about giving away some Wheat or Wood for Ore or Brick.\n\nA more reasonable trade could be:\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nHere, I'm giving (8*5) + (1*8) = 40 + 8 = 48 for 1 Ore (Value = 39). Still not ideal.\n\nLet's directly propose something more straightforward and see how the other player responds.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\n\nThis command follows the required format and proposes a trade that may or may not be accepted by the other player.\n\nMy current proposal is: \n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
