      "response": "After carefully evaluating my current resource values (Wheat: 5, Wood: 12, Sheep: 18, Brick: 25, Ore: 35), I recognize that trading must increase my total worth. The previous offer of 2 Sheep for 1 Ore was rejected, indicating Player 1 may have limited Ore or prioritizes other resources. \n\nTo propose a mutually beneficial exchange, I aim to leverage my surplus resources. I have abundant Wood (23) and Wheat (17), but these are lower-value. Sheep (18) hold moderate value, though I wish to avoid depleting them excessively. \n\nNew strategy: Offer Wheat and Wood for a Sheep. This exchange appeals if Player 1 values wood and wheat for specific needs. Specifically:\n\n**Offer: 1 Wheat + 2 Wood for 1 Sheep**  \n- My cost: (1 \u00d7 5) + (2 \u00d7 12) = 29  \n- My gain: 1 \u00d7 18 = 18  \n- *Net loss of 11? This miscalculation must be corrected.*\n\nRevised fair offer:  \n**Offer: 4 Wheat + 1 Wood for 1 Sheep**  \n- My cost: (4 \u00d7 5) + (1 \u00d7 12) = 32  \n- My gain: 18 \u2192 Loss of 14. Unfavorable. \n\nAdjusted to win-win:  \n**Offer: 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat for 1 Brick**  \n- My cost: 18 + 5 = 23  \n- My gain: 25 (net +2)  \n- Player 1\u2019s view: Gains 23 vs. Brick\u2019s 25? Loss of 2. Unlikely.\n\nFinal aggressive proposal, betting Player 1 may urgently need resources:  \n**[Offer: 1 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]**  \n- My cost: 12 + 20 = 32, gain 18 (net -14) \u2192 Still flawed.\n\nOptimal identified trade:  \n**[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep]**  \n- My cost: 15 + 24 = 39, gain 18 (net -21). Too costly.\n\nAfter recalculation, I\u2019ve decided a conservative approach maximizes value retention given uncertainty about Player 1\u2019s holdings.

      "response": "After careful evaluation of my current resources and previous rejected offers, I aim to propose a fair-value trade that might appeal to Player 1. My goal is to leverage my surplus Wheat (17 units, low individual value of 5) to acquire higher-value resources. Specifically, I target Brick (value 25) to enhance my collection's cumulative worth.\n\nI propose the following exchange:  \n**5 Wheat (total value 25) for 1 Brick (value 25)**. This trade is value-neutral and mutually equitable. Since I possess ample Wheat, parting with 5 units won't deplete my stock deeply (remaining: 12 Wheat), while gaining a Brick would increase my holdings in a higher-tier resource.\n\nThe offer is structured as:  \n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`  \n\nThis approach is strategic:  \n- **Fairness**: The offer ensures a balanced value exchange (25 \u2794 25), reducing Player 1's incentive to reject.  \n- **Value Growth Focus**: Brick holds higher utility per unit (25) than Wheat (5), positioning me to benefit long term.  \n- **Risk Mitigation**: Wheat is my most abundant low-value resource; sacrificing it minimally impacts my flexibility while testing Player 1's willingness to trade Brick.  \n\nI remain open to subsequent negotiations.
