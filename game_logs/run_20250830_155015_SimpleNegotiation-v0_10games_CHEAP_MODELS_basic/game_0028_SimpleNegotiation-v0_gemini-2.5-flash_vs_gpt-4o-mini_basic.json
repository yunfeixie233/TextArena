I need to be more strategic.\n\nLet's re-evaluate what I want and what I'm willing to give. I want to increase my total value. Ore and Brick are high value. Wheat and Wood are low. Sheep is medium.\n\nConsider this: I have a lot of Wheat and Wood. Perhaps Player 1 needs them.\nI want more high-value resources.\n\nLet's try to trade a significant amount of low-value resources for a smaller amount of high-value resources.\n\n[Offer: 20 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]\nValue offered: (20 * 6) + (10 * 11) = 120 + 110 = 230\nValue requested: (2 * 38) + (1 * 27) + (1 * 17) = 76 + 27 + 17 = 120\n\nThis is a terrible offer for me. I'm offering too much.\n\nLet's try to offer a profitable trade where I gain more value than I lose.\n\nCurrent resources:\nWheat: 25 (Value: 6)\nWood: 17 (Value: 11)\nSheep: 5 (Value: 17)\nBrick: 11 (Value: 27)\nOre: 12 (Value: 38)\n\nI want to acquire more Ore and Brick. I have a decent amount of Brick and Ore, but I can always get more. My Sheep is low.\n\nLet's make an offer where I trade some lower value resources and a small amount of higher value resources for more higher value resources.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (10 * 6) + (5 * 11) + (2 * 17) = 60 + 55 + 34 = 149\nValue requested: (1 * 27) + (1 * 38) = 27 + 38 = 65\n\nThis is still not good. The previous offer was 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Brick, 2 Ore. This was rejected.\n\nLet's try to get rid of Wheat specifically as it's my lowest value resource.\n\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 15 * 6 = 90\nValue requested: 1 * 38 = 38\n\nThis is also a terrible offer for me if they accept. I am trying to increase my total value.\n\nLet's look at the previous accepted offer from Player 0 as an example during previous rounds. The game starts fresh so previous rounds are not necessarily relevant.\n\nI need to make an offer that is appealing to Player 1, while still increasing my total value.\nPlayer 1 rejected the previous offer of 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Brick, 2 Ore.\nValue of 10 Wheat + 5 Wood = 60 + 55 = 115\nValue of 3 Brick + 2 Ore = 81 + 76 = 157\nMy offer meant I was acquiring 157 in value for 115, a net gain of 42. Player 1 likely saw this as them losing 42 in value.\n\nI should make an offer that is closer to parity or slightly negative for me to incentivize Player 1 to accept, but overall results in a net gain for me if resources are re-evaluated.\nThe goal is to increase the total value of my resources.\n\nLet's try to get just one high value resource, maybe by giving up some medium and low value ones.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nValue Offered: (5 * 11) + (3 * 17) = 55 + 51 = 106\nValue Requested: (1 * 27) = 27\nThis is very bad for me.\n\nMy goal is to increase total value. I have a lot of low-value items. I want to convert them into high-value items.\n\nConsider trading:\n10 Wheat (60)\n10 Wood (110)\nTotal value: 170\n\nWhat can I get for it? Ideally high-value items.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]\nValue Offered: (10 * 6) + (10 * 11) = 60 + 110 = 170\nValue Requested: (2 * 38) + (1 * 27) = 76 + 27 = 103\n\nThis trade loses me 67 in value, on paper. Player 1 might accept it as they gain value.\nThen I would have:\nWheat: 15\nWood: 7\nSheep: 5\nBrick: 11 + 1 = 12\nOre: 12 + 2 = 14\n\nNew total value: 15*6 + 7*11 + 5*17 + 12*27 + 14*38\n= 90 + 77 + 85 + 324 + 532 = 1108\n\nThis is lower than my current total value (1175). I must acquire more value than I give up.\n\nLet's try for a small gain for me, but maybe a larger gain for player 1, to ensure acceptance.\n\nMy previous offer was 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Brick, 2 Ore (115 -> 157, net +42 for me). This was rejected.\nSo Player 1 does not want to give up 157 value for 115 value.\n\nPerhaps Player 1 values my resources more than I value theirs.\n\nLet's try to offer mostly high value resources for even higher value resources, for a net gain.\nBut I don't want to offer my high value resources unless absolutely necessary.\n\nLet's re-think. How about giving up some Brick and getting something else, perhaps more Ore?\nI have 11 Brick (27 each) and 12 Ore (38 each).\n\nWhat if I offer a smaller amount of my low-value resources for a high-value resource?\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (7 * 6) + (3 * 11) = 42 + 33 = 75\nValue requested: 1 * 38 = 38\nThis is also a terrible value trade for me.\n\nI need to make an offer where the \"Requested Items\" total value is GREATER than the \"Offered Items\" total value.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick]\nValue offered: (5 * 6) + (5 * 11) = 30 + 55 = 85\nValue requested: (1 * 17) + (1 * 27) = 17 + 27 = 44\nThis is bad for me. I keep proposing bad trades for myself. I need to flip it.\n\n**I want my value requested to be HIGHER than my value offered.**\n\nLet's propose a trade that should be hard for Player 1 to refuse, by offering them more.\nThen, if accepted, my value increases.\n\nLet's try to convert low-value resources into high-value resources.\n\n[Offer: 15 Wheat, 7 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]\nValue Offered: (15 * 6) + (7 * 11) = 90 + 77 = 167\nValue Requested: (1 * 27) + (1 * 38) = 27 + 38 = 65\n\nThis is still me losing a lot of value. My previous rejected offer was a gain for me.\nThe previous turn, Player 1 rejected an offer where I would have gained 42 value. This means P1 would have lost 42 value.\n\nI must propose something that results in a gain for me, and ideally a small loss or slightly positive for Player 1, without knowing their values.\n\nLet's try a small trade with high-value items, where I get more.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nValue Offered: 1 * 27 = 27\nValue Requested: 1 * 38 = 38\nNet gain for me: 38 - 27 = 11.\nThis is a good trade for me if accepted. It's a small loss for Player 1.\nThis seems like a reasonable offer.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
