      "response": "### Initial Analysis\n\n**Current Resources and Values:**\n- **Wheat**: 13 units \u00d7 5 = 65 total value\n- **Wood**: 22 units \u00d7 8 = 176 total value\n- **Sheep**: 21 units \u00d7 17 = 357 total value\n- **Brick**: 20 units \u00d7 28 = 560 total value\n- **Ore**: 17 units \u00d7 36 = 612 total value\n\n**Total Current Value**: 65 + 176 + 357 + 560 + 612 = 1,770\n\n**Goal**: Increase total value through trading. To do this, I should aim to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones where possible, considering the quantities of each resource.\n\n### Resource Values Ranking (Highest to Lowest):\n1. Ore (36)\n2. Brick (28)\n3. Sheep (17)\n4. Wood (8)\n5. Wheat (5)\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Ore and Brick** are the highest-value resources. I should aim to accumulate more of these.\n- **Sheep, Wood, Wheat** are lower-value. These are good candidates to offer in trades.\n- Since I have a decent amount of Sheep (21), Wood (22), and Wheat (13), I can afford to trade some of these for higher-value resources.\n\n### Potential Trades:\n1. **Sheep for Ore/Brick**: Sheep is 17, Ore is 36 (more than double). Trading Sheep for Ore is highly beneficial.\n2. **Wood for Brick**: Wood is 8, Brick is 28. Trading Wood for Brick is very good.\n3. **Wheat for anything higher**: Wheat is the lowest at 5, trading it for anything higher is good.\n\nHowever, I need to consider what the opponent might want. They probably have similar value scales, so they might not easily give up high-value resources. I should propose trades where I offer a fair or slightly favorable deal to them to encourage acceptance, while still gaining value for myself.\n\n### First Offer:\nI have plenty of Sheep (21), and it's mid-value (17). Ore is high (36), and Brick is high (28). \n\nA possible trade: Offer Sheep and/or Wood for Ore or Brick.\n\n**Offer Idea**: 3 Sheep (3\u00d717=51) for 2 Ore (2\u00d736=72). This would net me +21 value (72-51=21), while the opponent gains 51 and loses 72, which is -21 for them. They might reject this as it's not beneficial to them.\n\nInstead, I need to give them something more appealing. Maybe offer more Sheep per Ore, like 3 Sheep (51) for 1 Ore (36). This is +36 -51 = -15 for them, still not great.\n\nAlternatively, offer Wood for Brick: 4 Wood (4\u00d78=32) for 1 Brick (28). Net +28 -32 = -4 for them, still unfavorable.\n\nThis suggests direct trades of lower for higher might not work. I need to offer combinations where the opponent sees value.\n\n**Better Offer**: Offer multiple lower-value resources for higher ones. For example:\nOffer 5 Sheep (5\u00d717=85) for 2 Ore (2\u00d736=72) + 1 Brick (28). Total requested: 72+28=100. Net for opponent: +85 -100 = -15, still not ideal.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to offer more. \n\n**Alternative Approach**: Since the values are fixed, perhaps the opponent has different value rankings or needs. I can try to see what they might need more of. \n\nBut since I don't know their initial resources, I'll proceed with a reasonable offer and adjust based on their response.\n\n**First Proposal**: \nOffer 4 Sheep (4\u00d717=68) for 2 Ore (2\u00d736=72). This is 68 vs 72, so -4 for the opponent. They might accept if they really need Sheep.\n\nBut to make it more appealing, let's add a little more or adjust:\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 1 Wheat]\n\nWait, that would be 5\u00d717=85 vs 2\u00d736+5=77. Net +8 for them. They might accept.\n\nBut I don't have info on opponent's Wheat, so offering Wheat might not help.\n\nLet me try a simpler one: 6 Sheep (102) for 2 Ore (72) + 1 Brick (28). Net 102 vs 100, so +2 for them. Close to fair.\n\nBut 6 Sheep is a lot to give. Maybe 5 Sheep (85) for 2 Ore (72) + 1 Wheat (5). Net 85 vs 77, +8 for them. If they need Wheat, this could work.\n\nBut I don't want to give Wheat since it's lowest for me.\n\n**Simpler First Offer**: 4 Sheep (68) for 2 Ore (72). Net -4 for them. Maybe they'll take if they need Sheep.\n\nLet's try this first.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
