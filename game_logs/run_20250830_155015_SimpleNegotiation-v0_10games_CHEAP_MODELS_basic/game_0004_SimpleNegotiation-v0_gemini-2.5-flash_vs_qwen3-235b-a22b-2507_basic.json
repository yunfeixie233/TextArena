I might look to trade Wheat or Wood for higher-value resources, or improve my Sheep count.\n\nLet's begin by making an offer that tries to increase my overall value by trading away some lower-value items for higher-value items or items I have fewer of.\n\nI want to get more Sheep because I only have 6, and it's a moderately valuable resource. I also have a lot of Wheat, which is my lowest value resource.\n\nTurn 1: I will offer a good amount of my lowest value resource (Wheat) for a small amount of a resource I have fewer of (Sheep), or for a higher-value resource.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Sheep]",
