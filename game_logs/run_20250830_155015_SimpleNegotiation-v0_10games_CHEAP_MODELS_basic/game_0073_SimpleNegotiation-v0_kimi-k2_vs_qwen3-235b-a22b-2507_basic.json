      "response": "Looking at these interactions, Player 1 has been consistently rejecting all offers from my side and only made one extremely one-sided offer asking for 8 Wheat and 3 Brick while only offering 3 Sheep and 5 Wood. This is clearly an unreasonable trade that heavily favors them.\n\nLet me analyze my actual goal: I want to MAXIMIZE the total value of my resources by making profitable trades. Based on the revealed values:\n\n- **Sheep** is worth 18 per unit  \n- **Brick** is worth 23 per unit  \n- **Ore** is worth 38 per unit (highest value)\n\nMy current holdings show I have 18 Ore at the highest individual value (38), suggesting Ore is the premium resource. Given Player 1's strategy of rejecting everything while making exploitative offers, they are clearly not trying to make fair trades.\n\n**Since Player 1 is offering terrible trades and rejecting reasonable ones, continuing to make offers is not beneficial.** Making any more offers wastes my turn when they have demonstrated zero willingness to negotiate.\n\n[Deny]",
