      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, the goal is to increase the total value of the resources I hold through trading with my opponent. The resources and their current values are as follows:\n- Wheat: 8 units, Value: 6 per unit\n- Wood: 9 units, Value: 12 per unit\n- Sheep: 7 units, Value: 14 per unit\n- Brick: 19 units, Value: 26 per unit\n- Ore: 12 units, Value: 39 per unit\n\nThe total value of the resources I currently hold is calculated as:\n\\[Total Value = (8 \\times 6) + (9 \\times 12) + (7 \\times 14) + (19 \\times 26) + (12 \\times 39)\\]\n\\[Total Value = 48 + 108 + 98 + 494 + 468\\]\n\\[Total Value = 1216\\]\n\n### Strategic Consideration\n\nTo maximize the total value, I need to identify which resources are undervalued or overvalued relative to others and make trades accordingly. The values per unit are already given, so I can directly compare them.\n\n1. **Value per Unit Ranking:**\n   - Ore: 39\n   - Brick: 26\n   - Sheep: 14\n   - Wood: 12\n   - Wheat: 6\n\n2. **Initial Observation:**\n   - I have a significant quantity of Brick and Ore, which are the highest value resources.\n   - Wheat is the least valuable resource.\n\n### Trade Strategy\n\nGiven that Ore and Brick are highly valued and I already possess a substantial amount of them, my strategy will be to try to acquire more of these or maintain my current holding while possibly offloading some of the less valuable resources.\n\n1. **First Turn Strategy:**\n   - I will start by offering to trade some of my less valuable resources (relative to Ore and Brick) to see if I can get a better deal.\n   - Considering Wheat is the least valuable, I might start by offering Wheat.\n\nLet's propose a trade:\n- I have Wheat (Value: 6) and Wood (Value: 12). Let's offer some Wheat for a more valuable resource.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nI'll make an offer to trade 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep, hoping to get a slightly more valuable resource or at least test the waters for potential trades.\n\n**Offer:** `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nThis is my first move, and I'm open to negotiations. If my opponent counters or accepts, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\n### Response Format\n\nAs per the instructions, my response for the first turn is: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`.",

The last trade resulted in a net gain of 1 Sheep, which is valued at 14. To continue improving our resource value, we need to analyze the current holdings and potential trades.\n\n#### Potential Trade Opportunities:\n1. **Evaluate Current Holdings:** We have a good quantity of Brick and Ore, which are high in value. Wheat is relatively low in value and quantity has decreased.\n   \n2. **Trade Strategy:** \n   - Consider trading lower-value items or surplus items for higher-value items or items that are scarce.\n   - Since we have a good amount of Brick and Ore, we might look to trade some of these if we can get an even more valuable resource or a resource that is critical for future trades.\n\n3. **Potential Trade:**\n   - One potential trade could involve offering some of our Wheat or Wood (lower/moderate value resources) for a more valuable resource. However, Wheat quantity is now low.\n   - Another strategy could be to offer some Brick (abundant) for a resource that is either more valuable or scarce.\n\n#### Proposed Trade Offer for Turn 2:\nConsidering the above analysis and the fact that we have a decent amount of Ore and Brick but a relatively lower quantity of Sheep and Wood compared to Brick and Ore, a potential trade could be:\n- Offer 2 Wood (Value: 2*12 = 24) for 1 Ore (Value: 39). This seems like a favorable trade as we gain more value than we give away.\n\nHowever, let's directly propose a trade that seems reasonable based on our resources and the goal to increase total value.\n\n### Trade Offer for Player 1:\n'[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis trade involves offering 3 Brick (Value: 3*26 = 78) for 1 Ore (Value: 39). This is not favorable as we're losing value. Let's reconsider.\n\n### Alternative Trade Offer:\nLet's think about offering something less valuable for something potentially more valuable or equally valuable.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep]'\n\nHere, we're offering 2 Wheat (2*6 = 12) and 1 Wood (12) totaling 24 in value for 2 Sheep (2*14 = 28). This trade slightly increases our total value.\n\nLet's proceed with this thought.\n\n### Action:\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep]'",
