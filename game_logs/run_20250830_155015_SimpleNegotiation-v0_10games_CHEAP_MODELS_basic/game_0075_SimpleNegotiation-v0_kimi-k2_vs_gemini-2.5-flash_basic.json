Since Player 1 keeps bidding for Ore (they tried to give me 5 Wheat + 1 Brick for 1 Ore in the last turn), they\u2019re clearly Ore-thirsty.  Sheep are cheap to me (12 pts each) and I have 23 of them.  I\u2019m willing to part with some Sheep if I can get back Ore, but at a steeper ratio than they just proposed.\n\nI\u2019ll now make a counter offer that still looks tempting for them\u20144 Sheep for 1 Ore\u2014which is more Sheep per Ore than the market ratios I\u2019ve previously proposed, but still below their own bid yardstick.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
