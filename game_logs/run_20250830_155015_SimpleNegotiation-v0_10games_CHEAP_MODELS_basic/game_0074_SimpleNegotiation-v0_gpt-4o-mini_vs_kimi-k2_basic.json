This seems unfavorable to my position.\n\nLooking at the value gaps: Wheat/Wood have the lowest unit values (0.5 and ~0.45 respectively), while Ore has the highest (1.5) followed closely by Brick (~0.96). Sheep also has good value (1.17).\n\nMy current holdings appear strong in high-value resources (Brick, Ore), though my quantities are getting somewhat reduced from these trades.\n\nSince Player 0 is focused on acquiring Brick and Ore (high-value) while offering lower-value resources, and has rejected my recent offers, I should focus on consolidating my position. I'll wait for Player 0's next move before deciding my next offer.\n\n[Deny]",
