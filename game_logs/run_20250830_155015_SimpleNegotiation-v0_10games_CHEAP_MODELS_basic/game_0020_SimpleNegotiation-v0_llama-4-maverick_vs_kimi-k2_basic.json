We should analyze the previous interactions to understand what the opponent is willing to accept and make offers accordingly.\n\n1. **Understanding Opponent's Preferences:** The opponent accepted an offer of 3 Wheat for 1 Brick. This indicates they value Brick highly and are willing to trade it for Wheat at a certain ratio.\n\n2. **Resource Valuation:** \n   - We gained 1 Brick (Value: 21) for 3 Wheat (Value: 18). This was a good trade.\n   - Our next offer was rejected: 4 Sheep (Value: 48) and 2 Wheat (Value: 12) for 2 Ore (Value: 66). The total value offered was 60, and the requested value was 66. Although the trade is almost fair in terms of value, it was rejected.\n\n3. **Potential Trades:**\n   - Since the opponent is willing to trade Brick for Wheat, we should consider other resources they might be willing to trade.\n   - We need to identify a trade that is likely to be accepted and increases our total resource value.\n\n### New Offer\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (since we have a surplus and the opponent is willing to trade for it) for another Brick or other valuable resources. However, we should also consider not offering Wheat since we've already made several offers involving it.\n\nAn alternative is to look at our other resources:\n- We have 25 Sheep. Offering some Sheep for a valuable resource could be beneficial if we can get the right ratio.\n\nLet's analyze trading Sheep for Ore since Ore is very valuable:\n- We previously offered 4 Sheep and 2 Wheat for 2 Ore and were rejected. Let's adjust the offer.\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nConsidering our resources and the previous outcomes, let's make a new offer. We will offer 3 Sheep for 1 Ore. The total value offered is 3 * 12 = 36, and the value requested is 1 * 33 = 33. This is a slightly unfavorable trade for us but still relatively balanced.\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Since I am Player 0, let's analyze the current situation:\n\nInitial Resources:\n- Wheat: 20, Value: 6\n- Wood: 13, Value: 11\n- Sheep: 25, Value: 12\n- Brick: 13, Value: 21\n- Ore: 8, Value: 33\n\nAfter the last accepted trade (3 Wheat -> 1 Brick):\n- Wheat: 20 - 3 = 17\n- Brick: 13 + 1 = 14\n\nCurrent Resources:\n- Wheat: 17, Value: 6\n- Wood: 13, Value: 11\n- Sheep: 25, Value: 12\n- Brick: 14, Value: 21\n- Ore: 8, Value: 33\n\nNow, let's analyze the new offer from Player 1: [Offered items: 2 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore]\n\nIf I accept this offer:\n- I give 1 Ore (Value: 33)\n- I receive 2 Wood (Total Value: 2 * 11 = 22)\n\nSince 22 (received) is less than 33 (given), accepting this offer would decrease the total value of my resources.\n\nLet's calculate the current total value and the new total value if the offer is accepted:\nCurrent Total Value = (17 * 6) + (13 * 11) + (25 * 12) + (14 * 21) + (8 * 33)\n= 102 + 143 + 300 + 294 + 264\n= 1103\n\nNew Total Value if accepted = (17 * 6) + (13 + 2) * 11 + (25 * 12) + (14 * 21) + (8 - 1) * 33\n= 102 + (15 * 11) + 300 + 294 + (7 * 33)\n= 102 + 165 + 300 + 294 + 231\n= 1092\n\nAs the new total value (1092) is less than the current total value (1103), it is not beneficial to accept the offer.\n\nMy response will be: [Deny] \n\nSince it's my turn, I need to make a new offer. Let's re-evaluate my resources and think about a trade that could be beneficial. One idea is to try and get more Ore since it has a high value.\n\nLet's consider making an offer to trade some of my less valuable resources for Ore.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore] \n\nThis offer is made because Sheep has a relatively lower value compared to Ore, and giving away 3 Sheep (Value: 3 * 12 = 36) for 1 Ore (Value: 33) is not beneficial. However, it's worth trying to negotiate.\n\nLet's adjust the offer: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (2 * 12) + (1 * 6) = 24 + 6 = 30 and requests 1 Ore worth 33. This could be a more reasonable trade.\n\nMy action: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
