      "response": "After reviewing my current resources and their values, I realize that increasing my total value requires acquiring more high-value resources like Ore (value 37) and Brick (value 27) by trading away lower-value resources like Wheat (value 5), Wood (value 12), or Sheep (value 16). Since I have a surplus of Wheat and Sheep, I want to test if trading Sheep for Ore in a 2:1 ratio is viable. That trade gives me a net value gain of +5 (since 2 Sheep \u00d7 16 = 32, and 1 Ore \u00d7 37 = 37). This seems fair for an opening offer, as the opponent might value Sheep more than I do, making it mutually beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I propose the following trade:\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
