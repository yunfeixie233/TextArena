It was too close to being even for them. They would want to gain value.\n\nI want to offer low-value resources like Wheat and Wood for high-value resources like Brick and Ore.\nLet's try a simpler offer to get 1 Ore.\n1 Ore is 36.\nIf I offer 3 Wood (24) and 3 Wheat (15) = 39. This is still unfavorable to me (I lose 3 value).\n\nHow about trade Sheep for Brick?\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nOffered: 16\nRequested: 28\nThis is good for me, but too bad for Player 1. They'll never accept.\n\nI need to make an offer that gives me a net gain in value, and is also palatable for Player 1.\nLet's assume Player 1 wants some combination of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep.\n\nLet's offer a combination of lower-value resources to gain one high-value resource.\nTarget: 1 Ore (36)\nOffer: X Wheat + Y Wood (total value slightly less than 36, or equal, but they *gain* the Ore)\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nOffered: (4 * 8) + (3 * 5) = 32 + 15 = 47\nRequested: 36\nThis is unfavorable for me. I lose 11 value. I want to *gain* value.\n\nOkay, I need to make an offer where I *gain* value.\nMy current value: 1106.\n\nLet's attempt a clear gain for me, but perhaps with many items from me.\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 8 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]\nOffered Value: (8 * 5) + (8 * 8) = 40 + 64 = 104\nRequested Value: (1 * 28) + (1 * 36) = 64\nThis is extremely bad for me. I would lose 40 value.\n\nI must make an offer that results in *my* total value increasing. This means (Value of requested items) > (Value of offered items).\n\nPerhaps Player 1 has plentiful Brick and Ore and wants to get rid of them.\nLet's try to get a single Ore or Brick.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nOffered: 3*8 + 2*5 = 24 + 10 = 34\nRequested: 1*28 = 28\nLoss of 6 value for me.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nOffered: 4*8 + 3*5 = 32 + 15 = 47\nRequested: 28\nLoss of 19 value for me.\n\nI need to be more careful about the value exchange.\nMaybe I should offer some Sheep.\nSheep value 16.\nBrick value 28.\nOre value 36.\n\nIf I offer X Sheep for Y Brick.\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nValue Offered: 16\nValue Requested: 28\nGain of 12 for me. This is what I want. But Player 1 would lose 12. Highly unlikely they will accept.\n\nLet's try an offer that is slightly tilted in my favor.\nI want to get Ore (36) or Brick (28).\nI have plenty of Wheat (5) and Wood (8).\n\nLet's propose: [Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (6 * 5) + (4 * 8) = 30 + 32 = 62\nValue requested: 1 * 36 = 36\nThis is bad for me. I lose 26.\n\nI am Player 0. My goal is to increase the value of my resources.\nI need a trade where the requested value is higher than the offered value.\n\nLet's target an Ore (36).\nCould I offer Sheep and Wood?\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 16 + 8 = 24\nValue requested: 36\nNet gain for me: 12.\nThis is a good offer for me. Is it acceptable to Player 1? They lose 12 value.\n\nIt's turn 2, Player 1 rejected my previous offer.\nI need to make a new offer that still benefits me, but is perhaps more appealing to Player 1 than my last one.\nThe previous offer was (total offered 65) for (total requested 64). I was gaining almost nothing.\n\nLet's try to get high-value items by giving up many low-value items.\nI have a surplus of Wheat and Wood.\n[Offer: 12 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (12 * 5) + (10 * 8) = 60 + 80 = 140\nValue requested: (2 * 28) + (1 * 36) = 56 + 36 = 92\nThis is very bad for me.\n\nI must remember to always ensure (Requested Value) > (Offered Value) for myself.\n\nLet's try for 1 Ore (36).\nWhat can I offer that sums to slightly less than 36, but is composed of lower-value items?\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 2 * 16 = 32\nValue requested: 1 * 36 = 36 (Gain of 4 for me)\nThis is a small gain for me, and Player 1 loses 4 value. This might be plausible for a small trade.\n\nLet's consider Player 1's possible needs. If they need Sheep, they might accept.\n\nLet's try this. It's a small gain, and relatively balanced.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
