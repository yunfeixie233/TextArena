Offered: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> Requested: 1 Ore (Rejected)\n2. Offered: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep -> Requested: 1 Ore, 3 Brick (Rejected)\n\n### Strategy\n\nOur goal is to increase the total value of our resources. To achieve this, we should focus on acquiring resources with higher values or increasing the quantity of resources that are already of high value.\n\n1. **Identify High-Value Resources**: Ore (Value: 37) and Brick (Value: 25) are our highest value resources. Increasing their quantity could be beneficial.\n   \n2. **Analyze Previous Offers**: Our previous offers were rejected. The first offer requested Ore, which is a high-value resource. The second offer requested Ore and Brick, both of which are high-value. The rejection suggests that the requested resources might be valuable to us but not easily parted with by Player 0.\n\n3. **Formulate a New Offer**: To make a successful trade, we need to consider what we can offer that is of relatively lower value to us but of higher value to Player 0, and what we are requesting that is of higher value to us.\n\n### New Offer\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (Value: 5) and possibly some Wood (Value: 8) for Ore (Value: 37), as Ore is our highest value resource and increasing its quantity significantly increases our total value.\n\nFor example, offering 7 Wheat (Total Value: 35) and 3 Wood (Total Value: 24) for 1 Ore (Total Value: 37) would be a gain of 37 - (35 + 24) = -22 in total value. However, this is still a relatively small loss compared to the potential gain of having more Ore or other high-value resources.\n\nLet's propose:\n- Offered: 7 Wheat, 3 Wood -> Requested: 1 Ore\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 7 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis offer is made with the intention of acquiring a high-value resource (Ore) by trading off relatively lower-value resources. It adheres to the required format for making a trade offer in the Negotiation Game.",
