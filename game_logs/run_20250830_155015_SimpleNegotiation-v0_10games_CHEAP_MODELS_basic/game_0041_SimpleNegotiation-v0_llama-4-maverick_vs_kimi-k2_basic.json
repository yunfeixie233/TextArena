This implies that either Player 1 did not need Sheep or had a better alternative to obtain Sheep, or valued Wheat more than the trade offered.\n- The second offer (4 Wood for 1 Ore) was also rejected. Given that Ore is highly valued (Value: 36), it seems reasonable to offer valuable resources for it. However, the quantity of Wood offered (4, valued at 44) might have been too high compared to the value of 1 Ore (36).\n\n#### Strategy for Next Turn\nGiven the rejections, we need to reassess what to offer. The goal is to increase the total value of resources.\n\n1. **Identify Valuable Resources to Acquire:** Resources with higher values are more desirable. Ore (Value: 36) is the most valuable, followed by Brick (Value: 21).\n\n2. **Consider Alternative Trades:** Since the previous offers were rejected, we need to think about alternative trades that could be more appealing to Player 1 while still being beneficial to us.\n\n3. **New Offer:** Let's consider offering resources that are less valuable to us in exchange for more valuable resources. For example, offering Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 11) for Ore (Value: 36) could be a good start.\n\n#### Proposed Trade for Next Turn\nLet's propose: **[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]**\n\n- We are offering 6 Wheat (Total Value: 30) for 1 Ore (Value: 36). This trade increases our total value since we gain 6 in value (36 - 30 = 6).\n\n### Action\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
