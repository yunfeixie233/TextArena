Total value I give: 140 + 32 = 172\nI receive: 3 Sheep (3 * 16 = 48), 2 Ore (2 * 35 = 70).

I want to trade resources that I have in abundance for resources that have higher value or that I need. Ore is a high-value resource. Sheep and Wheat are lower value and I have a decent quantity of Wheat.\n\nI want to acquire more Ore. I have plenty of Brick and Wheat.\nI'll offer to give some Brick and Sheep (as I have 6, and don't want to go too low) and request Ore.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore.\n[Offer: 3 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue I give: 3 Brick (3 * 28 = 84), 1 Sheep (1 * 16 = 16). Total: 100\nValue I receive: 1 Ore (1 * 35 = 35). Total: 35\nThis is still bad for me. I am losing significant value.\n\nI need to make an offer that is beneficial to me. I have a lot of Brick and Wheat. I want Ore.\n\nLet's try to offer low-value items for higher-value items.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Wood.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wheat for a smaller quantity of Ore or Brick?\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue I give: 10 Wheat (10 * 5 = 50)\nValue I receive: 1 Ore (1 * 35 = 35)\nStill negative for me.\n\nLet's consider Player 0's initial offer and try to adjust it to my favor. They offered (3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep). They want Brick and Sheep.\n\nMaybe I can offer low-value items (Wheat, Wood) for their Ore.\n\n[Offer: 15 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]\nValue I give: 15 Wheat (15 * 5 = 75), 5 Wood (5 * 10 = 50). Total = 125\nValue I receive: 2 Ore (2 * 35 = 70). Total = 70\nStill losing value.\n\nI want to make an offer that is slightly positive for me, while potentially being appealing to Player 0.\nMy goal is to increase my total resource value.\n\nI'll try to get Ore. I have 19 Ore. Having more Ore is good.\nI have 23 Brick, maybe I can trade some Brick for Ore.\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nValue I give: 3 * 28 = 84\nValue I receive: 1 * 35 = 35\n(84 - 35 = 49 loss)\n\nWhat if I offer to trade some lower value resources for a high value one, or slightly higher than an equivalent value.\nI have plenty of Wood and Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 12 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue I give: 12 * 10 = 120\nValue I receive: 1 * 35 = 35\n(85 loss)\n\nThis is harder than I thought. I need to make an offer where the value coming in exceeds the value going out for me.\n\nConsider what Player 0 requested: Brick and Sheep.\nThey offered (3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep).\nThey value Brick.\nWhat if I offer to give them Brick for their Ore?\n\nLet's try offering a relatively small amount of my lower-value resources for a high-value resource.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue I give: (5 * 10) + (5 * 5) = 50 + 25 = 75\nValue I receive: 1 * 35 = 35\nStill a loss for me.\n\nI need to make an offer that increases my total value.\nMy current total value:\n23*5 (Wheat) + 23*10 (Wood) + 6*16 (Sheep) + 23*28 (Brick) + 19*35 (Ore)\n115 + 230 + 96 + 644 + 665 = 1750\n\nLet's try a small trade that is beneficial for me.\nWhat if I offer Sheep for Brick? I value Brick more than Sheep.\nI have 6 Sheep, they are 16 value. I have 23 Brick, they are 28 value.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nValue I give: 1 * 16 = 16\nValue I receive: 1 * 28 = 28\nThis is positive for me! (28 - 16 = 12 value gain).\nThis seems like a reasonable offer to make to another player, as it's not a huge loss for them in terms of raw value.\n\nLet's try this.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",
