      "response": "After reviewing the trade history and our current resource valuation, it seems previous offers for Brick and Wood were rejected, indicating Player 0 may value these resources highly or have limited supply. We need to prioritize trades that increase our total value based on our resource valuations: Wheat (6), Wood (11), Sheep (17), Brick (27), Ore (40).  \n\nWe have excess Wheat (25) with low value, so we should offload it for resources with higher value. Sheep (22) is reasonably valued at 17, but trading it could work if we get a net gain. Given Player 0 previously accepted trades involving Sheep and Wheat, we propose a balanced Sheep-for-Wheat swap that benefits us:  \n\n**[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]**  \n\n- We give 5 Wheat (value: 5 * 6 = 30) and receive 1 Sheep (value: 17).  \n- Net value change for us: +17 - 30 = -13 (loss).  \n*Re-evaluating: This initial proposal isn't favorable for us. Adjusting to avoid value loss.*  \n\nBetter approach: Since Player 0 values Wood (as seen when they offered 3 Wheat for 1 Wood), and Wood has medium value (11) to us, we can offer Wheat for Wood at a slight gain:  \n\n**[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood]**  \n\n- We give 2 Wheat (value: 12) and receive 1 Wood (value: 11).  \n- Net value change: +11 - 12 = -1 (marginal loss, but cleans up excess Wheat for fungible Wood).  \n*Still not ideal. Aim for a net positive by leveraging our abundant Sheep.*  \n\nOptimal adjustment: Shift focus to Sheep, which Player 0 has traded before. Offer Wheat for Sheep at a rate where we gain value:  \n\n**[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]**  \n\n- We give 3 Wheat (value: 18) and receive 1 Sheep (value: 17).  \n- Net value change: +17 - 18 = -1 (minimal loss, but consolidates low-value Wheat).  \n*Getting closer to a slight gain.*  \n\nStrongest offer: Player 0 demonstrated demand for Ore by previously giving 5 Sheep for 1 Ore. Since we have moderate Ore (19) but value it highly (40), we propose a safe trade using Sheep to acquire more Ore, ensuring clear value gain:  \n\n**[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**  \n\n- We give 2 Sheep (value: 2 * 17 = 34) and receive 1 Ore (value: 40).  \n- Net value change: +40 - 34 = +6 (gain).  \n\nThis offer has a positive value impact, uses our abundant Sheep, and aligns with Player 0's past Ore-seeking behavior.
