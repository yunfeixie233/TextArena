      "response": "### Initial Situation Analysis\nLet's start by calculating the total value of my current resources:\n- Wheat: 9 * 5 = 45\n- Wood: 16 * 10 = 160\n- Sheep: 9 * 18 = 162\n- Brick: 22 * 26 = 572\n- Ore: 23 * 34 = 782\nTotal value = 45 + 160 + 162 + 572 + 782 = 1,721\n\nMy goal is to increase this total value through trading. Looking at the values per resource:\n- Wheat: 5 (lowest)\n- Wood: 10\n- Sheep: 18\n- Brick: 26\n- Ore: 34 (highest)\n\nThis suggests that Ore and Brick are my most valuable resources, while Wheat is the least valuable. Ideally, I'd want to trade away lower value resources for higher value ones.\n\n### Identifying Trade Opportunities\nI have a lot of Brick (22) and Ore (23), which are already high in value. Trading these might not be beneficial unless I'm getting an even better deal. On the other hand, I have less Wheat and Wood (though Wood has middling value). \n\nGiven that Sheep has a value of 18, which is between Brick and Ore, it might be a good candidate to trade away if I can get more valuable resources in return. Wheat is definitely the lowest value, so trading it could be beneficial if possible.\n\nHowever, looking at the quantities, I have a decent amount of Sheep (9), but I've heard that in many games, Sheep is often sought after by opponents. Maybe I can leverage this.\n\n### First Move Strategy\nI need to probe what my opponent is willing to trade. I could offer some Sheep (which has mid-range value but I have a decent amount) to get higher value resources like Ore or Brick. \n\nBut before making an offer, I should see what the opponent has or expresses interest in. However, since I don't have that info yet, I'll make an initial offer that seems fair to me based on values.\n\n### Calculating a Fair Trade\nLet's say I offer to trade some Sheep for Ore. The value ratio is Ore:Sheep = 34:18 \u2248 1.89. So, roughly 2 Sheep for 1 Ore would be approximately fair, but since we're trading to gain value, I'd want to get more than this.\n\nSuppose I offer 3 Sheep for 2 Ore. \n- Value given: 3 * 18 = 54\n- Value received: 2 * 34 = 68\nThis would net me +14 value per such trade.\n\nBut let's check my quantities: I have 9 Sheep and 23 Ore, so giving up Sheep for Ore isn't ideal since I already have plenty of Ore. Maybe this isn't the best direction.\n\nAlternative: Trade Sheep for Brick. Brick:Sheep = 26:18 \u2248 1.44. So 3 Sheep for 4 Brick would net 3*18 vs 4*26 \u2192 54 vs 104, but I'm giving away more value. That's bad.\n\nMaybe trade Wheat instead. Wheat is low value and I have 9. What's the exchange rate? Wheat:Ore = 5:34 \u2248 0.15. So 7 Wheat for 1 Ore would be roughly fair, but that's a lot of Wheat to give up.\n\nAnother angle: Look at the opponent's needs. Since I don't know what they have or want, I should try to engage in conversation to find out. \n\nBut since the game is silent except for offers, I'll make an exploratory offer that seems reasonable from my side, aiming to get more high-value resources in exchange for lower or mid-value ones where I have quantities to spare.\n\n### Initial Offer\nI have a lot of Brick (22), but its value is 26, higher than Wood and Wheat. Maybe trading some extra Brick for Ore would help since Ore is the highest value. But Brick to Ore is 26:34, so 13 Brick for 10 Ore would be ~equal value (338 vs 340), but that's a large trade.\n\nInstead, I think trading Sheep for Ore is better since Sheep is 18 vs Ore 34 and I have 9 Sheep.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
