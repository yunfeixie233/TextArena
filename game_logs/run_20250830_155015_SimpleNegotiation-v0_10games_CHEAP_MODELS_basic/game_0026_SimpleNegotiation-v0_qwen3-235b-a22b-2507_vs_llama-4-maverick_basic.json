This changed the quantities:\n   - Gained: 8 Brick (Value: 21 * 8 = 168)\n   - Lost: 5 Sheep (Value: 14 * 5 = 70), 3 Ore (Value: 37 * 3 = 111)\n   - Net gain: 168 - (70 + 111) = -13\n\n2. **Subsequent Offers and Rejections**:\n   - Made an offer: 10 Wheat for 4 Brick.

Wood is also relatively abundant.\n   - Ore is valuable, and we have a moderate quantity.\n   - We lack Brick.\n\n3. **Formulate a Trade Offer**:\n   - Since our previous offers for Brick were rejected, we need to reconsider our proposal.\n   - One potential trade could involve offering some of our less valuable resources for Brick or other valuable resources.\n\n4. **Proposed Trade**:\n   - Consider offering some Wheat and/or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's formulate a trade:\n- Offer: 7 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Brick\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 7 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Brick]`\n\n### Action for This Turn:\n`[Offer: 7 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Brick]`",

Let's reassess and make a new offer.\n\nSince the last few offers were rejected, let's think about what could be a more appealing offer. \n\n**New Offer:**\nWe need Brick, and our last offers were focused on getting Brick. Let's think about offering something that might be more valuable or appealing to Player 0.\n\nConsidering the values:\n- Offering some Wheat (low value) or Wood (moderate value) might not be enough.\n- Sheep has a moderate value, and we have a good quantity.\n\nLet's try to make a more balanced offer.\n\n**Offered Resources:** 5 Wood, 2 Sheep\n**Requested Resources:** 3 Brick\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (5 * 11) + (2 * 14) = 55 + 28 = 83 and requests resources worth 3 * 21 = 63.
