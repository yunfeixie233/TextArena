      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to analyze the current situation and decide on the best initial trade offer. \n\nThe resources and their values are as follows:\n- Wheat: Qty = 8, Value = 6\n- Wood: Qty = 6, Value = 11\n- Sheep: Qty = 11, Value = 12\n- Brick: Qty = 14, Value = 24\n- Ore: Qty = 9, Value = 39\n\nFirst, let's sort the resources by their value per unit in descending order:\n1. Ore (Value = 39)\n2. Brick (Value = 24)\n3. Sheep (Value = 12)\n4. Wood (Value = 11)\n5. Wheat (Value = 6)\n\nTo increase the total value, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. \n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n- I have a lot of Brick (Value = 24) and some Ore (Value = 39). Trading some Brick for more Ore or keeping Ore and trying to get more high-value resources is a good strategy.\n- However, I need to be cautious and look for opportunities that benefit me.\n\nGiven the resources I have, one potential trade could involve offering some of my lower-value resources (in terms of quantity or type) for more valuable ones. \n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (the lowest value resource) or other resources that are not as valuable or abundant in value as Ore and Brick.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Potential Trades\nTo start, I can think about trading some of my less valuable resources. Wheat is the least valuable per unit, so it might be a good candidate for trade.\n\n## Step 2: Formulate a Trade Offer\nLet's offer 4 Wheat (which is half of my Wheat quantity) for something more valuable. However, I need to decide what to ask for. Since Ore is the most valuable, asking for Ore could be a good strategy.\n\n## Step 3: Consider a Reasonable Trade\nIf I offer 4 Wheat, that's a total value of 4 * 6 = 24. I could ask for 1 Ore (Value = 39), but that might be too much to ask for just 4 Wheat. A more reasonable trade needs to be considered.\n\n## Step 4: Propose a Trade\nLet's think about trading some Brick for Ore or other valuable resources. However, Brick is quite valuable. \n\n## Step 5: Make an Initial Offer\nLet's consider offering some Sheep (Value = 12) or Wood (Value = 11) for Ore. For example, offering 2 Sheep (total value = 24) for 1 Ore (Value = 39) is a potential trade, but it might not be seen as a fair trade by the opponent because I'm asking for a resource worth significantly more than what I'm offering.\n\n## Step 6: Decide on an Initial Trade Offer\nLet's propose a trade that could be seen as somewhat fair or at least worth considering. Offering 3 Brick (Value = 24 * 3 = 72) for 2 Ore (Value = 39 * 2 = 78) could be a potential trade. It's not a huge gain, but it's a step.\n\nLet's make the trade offer: '[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]'.\n\n'[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]'",

Since [Ore] is the most valuable resource and we have just increased our quantity, let's think about preserving or increasing it.\n\nLet's propose a trade that could be beneficial:\n\n`[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 3 Wood]`\n\nThis offer:\n- Gives away: 4 Sheep (Value: 12 * 4 = 48) and 2 Brick (Value: 24 * 2 = 48), total value given = 96\n- Requests: 1 Ore (Value: 39) and 3 Wood (Value: 11 * 3 = 33), total value requested = 72\n\nThis is not a good trade for us as it results in a net loss.\n\nLet's reconsider:\n\n`[Offer: 2 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 4 Brick]`\n\nThis offer:\n- Gives away: 2 Wood (Value: 11 * 2 = 22) and 3 Sheep (Value: 12 * 3 = 36), total value given = 58\n- Requests: 4 Brick (Value: 24 * 4 = 96)\n\nThis trade seems more favorable as we gain more value than we give away.\n\n#### Action to Take\n\n`[Offer: 2 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 4 Brick]`\n\nLet's execute this trade offer and see how Player 1 responds.\n\nAction: `[Offer: 2 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 4 Brick]`",

Later, I offered 3 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore, 2 Wood. So, I now have 11 - 1 = 10 Brick, 11 + 1 = 12 Ore, 11 - 3 = 8 Sheep, and 6 + 2 = 8 Wood.\n\nThe updated quantities are:\n+ [Wheat] Qty:8 Value:6\n+ [Wood] Qty:8 Value:11\n+ [Sheep] Qty:8 Value:12\n+ [Brick] Qty:10 Value:24\n+ [Ore] Qty:12 Value:39\n\nNow, let's analyze the last offer made by Player1: Offered items:6 Wheat -> Requested items:1 Brick\n\nI have 10 Brick, and giving away 1 Brick will leave me with 9 Brick. The value of 1 Brick is 24.\n\nI have 8 Wheat, and receiving 6 Wheat will give me 8 + 6 = 14 Wheat. The value of 6 Wheat is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nSince 36 (value of 6 Wheat) is greater than 24 (value of 1 Brick), accepting this trade is beneficial.\n\nMy response will be: [Accept]",
