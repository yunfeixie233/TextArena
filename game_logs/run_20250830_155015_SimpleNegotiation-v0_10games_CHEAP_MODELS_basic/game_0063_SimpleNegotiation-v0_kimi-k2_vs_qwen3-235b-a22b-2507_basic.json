      "response": "I'm Player 0 in the Negotiation Game and want to maximize my total value.  \nFirst I'll compute how much value *each* resource adds to me right now:\n\n- Wheat : 25 \u00d7 6 = 150  \n- Wood  : 25 \u00d7 8 = 200  \n- Sheep : 19 \u00d7 16 = 304  \n- Brick : 12 \u00d7 25 = 300  \n- Ore   : 18 \u00d7 36 = 648  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  \nCurrent total = 150 + 200 + 304 + 300 + 648 = **1 602**\n\nTo choose good trades I need an idea of fair market values.  \nConverting each resource into equivalent Ore value (using the ratio of my personal values):\n\n| Resource | My value | Ore value ratio vs. Ore (value 36) |\n|----------|----------|-------------------------------------|\n| Ore      | 36       | 1 Ore                               |\n| Brick    | 25       | 25/36 \u2248 0.69 Ore                    |\n| Sheep    | 16       | 16/36 \u2248 0.44 Ore                    |\n| Wood     | 8        | 8/36 \u2248 0.22 Ore                     |\n| Wheat    | 6        | 6/36 \u2248 0.17 Ore                     |\n\nKey observations  \n- My Ore is extremely valuable (highest per-unit value), so giving it away is only worthwhile at a very favorable rate.  \n- Brick is the next most valuable, while Wheat and Wood are comparatively \u201ccheap\u201d.  \n- Because Sheep has the greatest gap between my valuation (16) and its exchange value in the market (see typical trade ratios\u20144 Sheep for 1 Brick in standard Settlers), it is often overvalued by opponents yet cheaper for me internally.\n\nOpening goal: convert my excess Wheat/Wood into Brick or Ore, never trade away Ore unless the multiplier is huge. Because Brick and Ore are the only two resources I\u2019m happy to acquire, I\u2019ll make a very moderate opening proposal that doesn\u2019t ask for my own Ore.\n\nTurn 1  \n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Sheep]",
