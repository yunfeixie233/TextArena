      "response": "Given the history of rejected offers, I need to propose a trade that's appealing yet still increases my total resource value. My high-value resources (Brick and Ore) are crucial, but I can afford to trade small amounts of Ore paired with low-value Wheat to make the deal more attractive without significant loss. Based on my valuation:\n- Offering **1 Ore (Value: 38) and 1 Wheat (Value: 6)** totals **44**.\n- Requesting **2 Brick (Value: 52)** gives a net gain of **+8** for me.\n- This is reasonable for the opponent too, as it\u2019s closer to equal value than previous offers.\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",
