      "response": "### Negotiation Game Strategy for Player 0\n\n#### Initial Resources and Values:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 8    Value: 6\n- [Wood]    Qty: 6    Value: 12\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 10   Value: 17\n- [Brick]   Qty: 14   Value: 27\n- [Ore]     Qty: 5    Value: 37\n\n#### Game Goal:\nThe objective is to increase the total value of resources through trades over 10 turns.\n\n#### Initial Assessment:\n1. **Total Initial Value**: Calculate the total value of the resources.\n   - Wheat: 8 * 6 = 48\n   - Wood: 6 * 12 = 72\n   - Sheep: 10 * 17 = 170\n   - Brick: 14 * 27 = 378\n   - Ore: 5 * 37 = 185\n   - **Total**: 48 + 72 + 170 + 378 + 185 = 853\n\n2. **Resource Valuation**: Understand the value of each resource per unit.\n   - The highest value resource is Ore (37), followed by Brick (27), Sheep (17), Wood (12), and then Wheat (6).\n\n#### Strategy:\n1. **Identify Potential Trades**: Look for opportunities to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n2. **Make Strategic Offers**: Since the game involves negotiation, making reasonable offers that are likely to be accepted is crucial. Start by identifying what resources can be potentially traded away for higher-value resources.\n\n#### Turn 1 Action:\nLet's start by examining potential trades. One strategy could be to trade some of the lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for higher-value resources if possible, or to consolidate resources that are already of relatively high value.\n\nGiven the current resources, a potential trade could involve offering some Wheat or Wood (lower-value resources) in exchange for Ore or Brick (higher-value resources). However, without knowing the opponent's resources, we can start by making a general offer that could be attractive.\n\nLet's make an offer that involves trading away some of our lower-value resources:\n- **[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]**\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (4*6) + (2*12) = 24 + 24 = 48 for resources worth (1*37) + (1*27) = 37 + 27 = 64, which is a potentially beneficial trade.\n\n#### Action for Turn 1:\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",

This is not a good deal for me as I am requesting less value than I'm offering.\n\nHowever, if I request something more valuable, it might be more beneficial. \nLet's consider offering 2 Brick and requesting 1 Sheep and 1 Ore is not valid as I am trying to get a more valuable resource.\n\nAn alternative could be: \n[Offer: 2 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n- Offered resources: (2*27) + (1*17) = 54 + 17 = 71\n- Requested resources: 2*37 = 74\n\nThis seems like a good trade as I'm getting more value than I'm offering.\n\nMy action is: [Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 2 Ore]",

We offered 2 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore, and Player 1 accepted.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nOur goal is to increase the total value of our resources. Let's examine our current resources and think about potential trades.\n\n1. We have a relatively low quantity of Wood (1) and a moderate quantity of Ore (3). \n2. Our Wheat quantity decreased significantly due to the last trade.\n\nTo maximize our resources' value, we should look for opportunities to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values or to gain more quantity in higher-value resources.\n\n**Potential Trade:**\nConsidering the values:\n- Offering some Wheat (value: 6) or Brick (value: 27) for Ore (value: 37) could be beneficial since Ore has a higher value.\n- However, we need to be cautious about what we offer and ensure we're not losing too much value.\n\nLet's make a trade offer. We can offer some Brick (since we have a decent quantity) in exchange for Ore.\n\n**Trade Offer:**\n`[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis simplifies the offer while aiming to increase our Ore quantity, thus potentially increasing the total value of our resources.\n\n**Action:**\n`[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds.",
