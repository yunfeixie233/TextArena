      "response": "Based on the current game state and the offers made, here\u2019s a summary of the changes in your resources:\n\n**Player 0 Resources after Trades:**\n1. After accepting the trade with Player 1 that involved 12 Wheat and 1 Wood for 5 Sheep:\n   - Wheat: 6 - 12 = -6 (You can't have negative resources, so this should be considered invalid. Assuming you gained nothing from this trade)\n   - Sheep: 25 - 5 = 20\n   - Wood: 11 - 1 = 10\n\n2. After accepting the trade with Player 1 that involved 4 Sheep for 3 Ore:\n   - Sheep: 20 - 4 = 16\n   - Ore: 11 - 3 = 8\n\nSo, the final resources after those trades should be:\n- Wheat: 6\n- Wood: 11\n- Sheep: 16\n- Brick: 8\n- Ore: 8\n\n**Next Steps:**\nFor your next move, consider the latest offer from Player 1:\n- They are offering 5 Sheep in exchange for 3 Ore.\n\nGiven your current resources:\n- Accepting this trade will reduce your 16 Sheep to 11 and increase your 8 Ore to 5, which still leaves you with 8 Brick, 11 Wood, and 6 Wheat.\n\nYou need to analyze whether the loss of Sheep (4) is worth gaining additional Ore (which adds strategic value for future trades). If you decide to accept, your new resources will be:\n\n- Wheat: 6\n- Wood: 11\n- Sheep: 11\n- Brick: 8\n- Ore: 5\n\n**If you choose to accept Player 1's latest offer, your action will be:**\n`[Accept]`\n\n**If you decide to deny the offer, your action will be:**\n`[Deny]` \n\nChoose your action wisely!",
