My previous offer of 5 Wheat for 1 Wood was slightly profitable (5 value out, 12 value in, net +7).

My goal is to increase my own value.\nPlayer 1 offered 5 Sheep, 1 Wood for 2 Brick, 1 Wheat. They value Brick highly.\nI value Brick and Ore highly. I also have a lot of Sheep and Wheat.\n\nPerhaps I can offer Sheep for Brick or Ore.\nLet's try to get some Ore. Ore is my most valuable resource per unit.\nCould I offer Sheep for Ore?\nWhat about 3 Sheep for 1 Ore?\nValue of 3 Sheep = 3 * 14 = 42\nValue of 1 Ore = 1 * 33 = 33\nThis is also losing value.\n\nI seem to be over-requesting for what I am offering. I should try to make an offer that is more attractive to the opponent but still beneficial to me.\n\nLet's look at the past successful trade: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood.\nValue offered: 5 * 5 = 25\nValue requested: 1 * 12 = 12\nThis was a loss for me (25 out, 12 in). This means the opponent got a good deal.\n\nMy goal is to increase my value. So I need to offer cheaper items and request more expensive items.\nI have a lot of Wheat (21) and Sheep (18). These are my cheapest resources. My most expensive are Ore (33) and Brick (29).\n\nWhat if I offer 11 Wheat for 2 Wood?\nValue of 11 Wheat = 11 * 5 = 55\nValue of 2 Wood = 2 * 12 = 24\nStill not good for me.\n\nMy resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 21   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 11   Value: 12\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 18   Value: 14\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 11   Value: 29\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 16   Value: 33\n\nI want to trade away low-value resources for high-value resources.\nI can give Wheat and Sheep. I want Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the rejected offer from P1: 5 Ore -> 6 Wood, 1 Brick\nP1 was offering something valuable (Ore) and requesting something less valuable (Wood, Brick).\nValue Offered by P1: 5 * 33 = 165\nValue Requested by P1: (6 * 12) + (1 * 29) = 72 + 29 = 101.\nP1 would have lost value in this trade. This is why I rejected it. I shouldn't accept trades where I lose value.\n\nI must offer enough to make it attractive to P1, but still gain myself.\nLet's try trading Wheat for Brick.\nWhat if I offer 5 Wheat for 1 Brick? Value offered 25, value requested 29 (gain of 4). This was rejected before.\nWhat if I offer 6 Wheat for 1 Brick? Value offered 30, value requested 29 (loss of 1). Not good.\n\nPerhaps I can trade away a mix of my cheaper resources for a more expensive resource.\nWhat about offering a large amount of Wheat for a single Ore?\nLet's try 7 Wheat for 1 Ore.\nValue offered: 7 * 5 = 35\nValue requested: 1 * 33 = 33\nThis is still a loss of value for me. I need to request more value than I offer.\n\nThe value of the trade for me is (value of requested items) - (value of offered items). I need this to be positive.\n\nIf I offer X Wheat for 1 Brick (Value 29):\n29 - (X * 5) > 0\n29 > X * 5\nX < 29/5 = 5.8\nSo, if I offer 5 Wheat or less for 1 Brick, it's beneficial for me. My last offer of 5 Wheat for 1 Brick was beneficial for me, but P1 rejected it. P1 probably wants more.\n\nIf I offer X Wheat for 1 Ore (Value 33):\n33 - (X * 5) > 0\n33 > X * 5\nX < 33/5 = 6.6\nSo, if I offer 6 Wheat or less for 1 Ore, it's beneficial for me.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 is also trying to maximize their value.\nIf I offer 5 Wheat for 1 Brick:\nP1 receives 5 Wheat (value 25) and gives 1 Brick (value 29). P1 loses 4 value. This is why P1 rejected it.\n\nI need to make an offer where P1 gains value, and I also gain value. This is only possible if the total value of all resources is not constant, which it is. This means it's a zero-sum game, or rather, a game where one player's gain is the other player's loss *in terms of the value difference*. The goal is to gain more *total value*.\n\nMy goal is to increase *my* total value. My opponents goal is to increase *their* total value. A trade is only possible if both players see a positive gain *in their own calculation*.\n\nWait, the values are subjective. If P1 has a lot of Brick, they might value it less than the listed value.\nI should try to offer a resource I have in abundance (Wheat, Sheep) for a resource I have less of, or that has high value to me (Brick, Ore).\n\nLet's try to offer a trade where P1 actually gains value, to entice them.\nWhat about 10 Wheat for 2 Brick?\nMy gain: (2 * 29) - (10 * 5) = 58 - 50 = +8. (Good for me)\nP1's gain: (10 * 5) - (2 * 29) = 50 - 58 = -8. (Bad for P1) - This won't work.\n\nI need to find imbalances in inventory and perceived value. I don't know Player 1's inventory or preferences.\nHowever, if I assume Player 1 also uses the same values, then for a trade to be accepted, the value provided by me must be greater than the value I receive *from my perspective*, and also the value provided by P1 must be greater than the value P1 receives *from P1's perspective*.\n\nThe only way for both players to gain value based on the fixed valuations is if one resource is valued \"too low\" by one player and \"too high\" by another. But here, the values are fixed.\n\nLet me try to trade 1 of my high-value items for several low-value items that total more than my one high-value item. This would be a loss.\n\nLet's reconsider the previous accepted trade: Player 0 offered 5 Wheat -> Player 1 requested 1 Wood.\nPlayer 0: Offered 5 Wheat (25 value), Requested 1 Wood (12 value). Player 0 lost 13 value.\nPlayer 1: Offered 1 Wood (12 value), Requested 5 Wheat (25 value). Player 1 gained 13 value.\nThis was a bad trade for me. I should not repeat this.\n\nI need to make a trade where (Requested Value) > (Offered Value) for myself.\nAnd for Player 1, (Offered Value by me) < (Requested Value by me). No.\nAnd for Player 1, (Value of items given by P1) < (Value of items received by P1).\n\nLet's look at the current resources again:\n[Wheat] Qty: 21 Value: 5\n[Wood] Qty: 11 Value: 12\n[Sheep] Qty: 18 Value: 14\n[Brick] Qty: 11 Value: 29\n[Ore] Qty: 16 Value: 33\n\nI have 21 Wheat. It's my cheapest resource. Player 1 offered to trade 5 Sheep, 1 Wood for 2 Brick, 1 Wheat. They are asking for expensive resources (Brick) and offering Sheep/Wood. This confirms they value Brick, and possibly also Wheat.\n\nIf I give away my abundant cheap items for sparse expensive items, my total value will increase.\nI must find a trade that P1 might accept.\nMaybe P1 has a lot of Sheep and Wood and wants Brick.\nP1 offered: 5 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Wheat.\nValue P1 offered = 5*14 + 1*12 = 70 + 12 = 82\nValue P1 requested = 2*29 + 1*5 = 58 + 5 = 63\nThis would be a loss for P1 (82 out, 63 in). This should have been rejected by P0, and it was. Ah, actually this was the incoming offer from P1 to P0, and P0 (me) correctly rejected it because it would be a loss for P0.\n\nLet's try to offer a trade that is very slightly beneficial to me, but also potentially beneficial to P1 if their valuation or resource needs are different.\nI have a significant amount of Wheat and Sheep. I want Brick or Ore.\n\nHow about trading 1 of my Brick for 3 Sheep and 3 Wheat?\nOffered: 1 Brick (29 value)\nRequested: 3 Sheep (3*14=42) + 3 Wheat (3*5=15) = 57 value\nPlayer 0 would lose value (29 out, 57 in). This is bad for me. I should offer low value items for high value items.\n\nLet me try to get some Ore. It's the most valuable.\nIf I offer 4 Wood for 1 Ore.\nValue Offered: 4 * 12 = 48\nValue Requested: 1 * 33 = 33\nLoss of 15 for me.\n\nThe last trade I made was a bad one for me. I need to be more careful.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of a cheap resource for a small quantity of an expensive resource?\nI have 21 Wheat. What about offering 8 Wheat for 1 Brick?\nMy value change: +29 - (8 * 5) = +29 - 40 = -11. (Loss for me). Still bad.\n\nThis game is difficult if both players play optimally by the stated values. A trade can only happen if one player accepts a loss, or if the value system is not truly universal.\nHowever, I need to make a trade. I have to try to get a better deal for myself than the last accepted trade. The last accepted trade (5 Wheat -> 1 Wood) was a loss of 13 for me. So I should aim for something that loses less, or even gains.\n\nLet's assume P1 is like me and wants to gain value.\nI have 21 Wheat. I want to turn it into something more valuable.\nWhat if I offer a quantity of Wheat that is slightly higher than the value of what I want?\nLet's reconsider 5 Wheat for 1 Brick.\nMy gain if accepted: 29 - (5 * 5) = 29 - 25 = +4. (Good for me)\nP1's gain if accepted: (5 * 5) - 29 = 25 - 29 = -4. (Bad for P1, so P1 rejected this before)\n\nI need to make the offer appealing to P1. If P1 needs Wheat, they might accept it even if it's a slight loss based on theoretical values.\nWhat if I offer 6 Wheat for 1 Brick?\nMy gain: 29 - (6 * 5) = 29 - 30 = -1 (Small loss for me, but maybe acceptable if it leads to a trade and unlocks future trades).\nP1's gain: (6 * 5) - 29 = 30 - 29 = +1 (Small gain for P1, so P1 might accept this).\nThis seems like a fair and acceptable trade for both, slightly benefiting P1 while incurring a very minor loss for me. Given that the last accepted trade was a significant loss, this seems like a better approach.\n\nLet's try this.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"Offer\",\n  \"offered_items\": [\n    {\"resource\": \"Wheat\", \"quantity\": 6}\n  ],\n  \"requested_items\": [\n    {\"resource\": \"Brick\", \"quantity\": 1}\n  ]\n}\n```",
