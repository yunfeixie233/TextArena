Brick is very valuable (21 each) and rivals Ore (32) in usefulness; more Brick would raise my value faster. Hence I\u2019d like to trade Wheat/Wood for Brick.\n\n7 Wheat and 9 Wood are worth (7\u00d75)+(9\u00d79)=35+81=116. 5 Brick are worth 5\u00d721=105. That looks fair, so I\u2019ll offer 7 Wheat, 9 Wood in exchange for 5 Brick.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat, 9 Wood -> 5 Brick]",
