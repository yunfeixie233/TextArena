      "response": "My current resources:\n        Wheat: 21 (Value: 5)\n        Wood: 15 (Value: 8)\n        Sheep: 8 (Value: 17)\n        Brick: 12 (Value: 28)\n        Ore: 24 (Value: 33)\n\nThe opponent (Player 0) offered: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep  -> Requested: 1 Ore.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the exchanged resources:\nValue offered by Player 0: 1*5 (Wheat) + 1*8 (Wood) + 1*17 (Sheep) = 5 + 8 + 17 = 30\nValue requested by Player 0 (what I would give up): 1*33 (Ore) = 33\n\nIf I accept this trade, I would lose 33 value and gain 30 value, resulting in a net loss of 3 value. This is not beneficial to me. So I will deny this offer.\n\nI need to make a counter offer that increases my total value.\n\nI have a lot of Ore and Wheat. I could try to trade some Ore for Brick, as Brick has a good value.\nI want to make sure the value I receive is higher than the value I offer.\n\nLet's try to trade something I have in abundance (like Ore) for something that is valuable to me (like Brick or Sheep).\n\nConsider selling some Ore for Brick.\n1 Ore is 33 value.\n1 Brick is 28 value.\nIf I offer 1 Ore for 2 Brick, I would offer 33 value and receive 2*28 = 56 value. That's a good trade for me, but maybe too greedy.\nIf I offer 1 Ore for 1 Brick and 1 Sheep (28 + 17 = 45 value), that's good.\n\nLet's make a more balanced but still beneficial offer. I'll offer something I have a good quantity of (Wheat or Ore) for something I might need more of, or that has good value (Brick or Sheep).\n\nHow about trading Wheat for Sheep?\n1 Wheat = 5 value\n1 Sheep = 17 value\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (15 value) for 1 Sheep (17 value), it's a small gain for me.\n\nLet's try to exchange what Player 0 wanted (Ore) but make it more advantageous for me.\nPlayer 0 wanted 1 Ore (33 value). Let's see if I can get more from them for that 1 Ore.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore for 1 Brick and 1 Wood (28+8 = 36 value)? I gain 3 value.\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore for 2 Wood (16 value) and 1 Sheep (17 value) for a total of 33 value? That's neutral. Not good.\n\nLet's think about giving up some Ore, as I have 24.\nLet's ask for high-value items like Brick or Sheep.\n\nOffer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood (33 against 36) - Small gain.\nOffer: 1 Ore -> 1 Sheep, 1 Wood (33 against 17+8=25) - Loss.\nOffer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat (33 against 28+5=33) - Neutral. Not good.\n\nLet's try to make a profitable offer with something I have a lot of.\nI have a lot of Wheat (21 stacks).\nLet's offer some Wheat for Sheep or Brick.\n\nOffer: 5 Wheat (25 value) -> 1 Brick (28 value). Gained 3 value. This is reasonable.\nOffer: 4 Wheat (20 value) -> 1 Sheep (17 value). This is a loss.\n\nLet's try to get more for my Ore.\nMy current values:\nWheat: 5\nWood: 8\nSheep: 17\nBrick: 28\nOre: 33\n\nPlayer 0 offered 1 Wheat, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep (30 value) for 1 Ore (33 value). They lose 3 value.\n\nI will deny their offer and make a counter-offer.\n\nI want to make an offer where the value I receive is greater than the value I give.\n\nHow about I offer something I have abundantly (Ore, Wheat) for something I want more of (Sheep, Brick)?\n\nLet's offer 1 Ore for 2 Sheep.\nOffer: 1 Ore (33 value) -> 2 Sheep (2 * 17 = 34 value). I gain 1 value. This is a very small gain, but still a gain. It might be appealing to Player 0 if they need sheep.\n\nLet's try something bolder.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix? Say, 1 Wood and 1 Wheat for 1 Sheep?\nOffer: 1 Wood, 1 Wheat (8+5=13 value) -> 1 Sheep (17 value). I gain 4 value. This might be a good offer from my side.\n\nLet's go with an offer that clearly benefits me.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]",
