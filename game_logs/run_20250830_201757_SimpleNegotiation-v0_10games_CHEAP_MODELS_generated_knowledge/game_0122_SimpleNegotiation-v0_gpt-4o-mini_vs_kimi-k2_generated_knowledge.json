I ACCEPT 4 Wood + 5 Wheat  \u2192 3 Ore + 2 Brick\n   - Lose: \u20134 Wood, \u20135 Wheat\n   - Gain: +3 Ore, +2 Brick\n   New stock: Wheat 16, Wood 16, Sheep 17, Brick 15, Ore 27\n\n2. I ACCEPT 3 Wood + 2 Brick  \u2192 5 Ore + 3 Wheat\n   - Lose: \u20133 Wood, \u20132 Brick\n   - Gain: +5 Ore, +3 Wheat\n   New stock: Wheat 19, Wood 13, Sheep 17, Brick 13, Ore 32\n\nCurrent resource values:\n- Wheat  19 \u2192 95\n- Wood 13 \u2192 143\n- Sheep 17 \u2192 255 (unchanged)\n- Brick 13 \u2192 377 (unchanged)\n- Ore 32 \u2192 1088\nNet increase vs. start already ~ +102 value.\n\nLatest incoming offer:\nPlayer 0 offers [3 Wheat, 2 Brick] in exchange for [3 Wood, 2 Ore].\n\nCheck values for me:\n\nGive away:\n- 3 Wheat @5 = 15\n- 2 Brick @29 = 58\nTotal given value = 73\n\nReceive:\n- 3 Wood @11 = 33\n- 2 Ore  @34 = 68\nTotal received value = 101\n\nValue delta = +28 for me.\n\nI would still come out ahead on pure point value, but each Ore I trade away is the highest-value resource I hold. Looking at how my stock has shifted, I now own only 13 Wood left. I like that I am trending Ore-heavy, which is the most efficient asset. Trading more Ore away would continue to thin my lowest-supply item (Wood) but also eats into my now-plentiful Ore. The trade is net positive, but the gain is moderate.\n\nNevertheless, the game only has four more turns and the offer\u2019s gain is solid. I\u2019ll accept.\n\n[Accept]",
