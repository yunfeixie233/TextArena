Giving away 5 Wood (total value loss: 50) and 1 Brick (value loss: 20) costs me 70. Receiving 3 Ore (value gained: 114) nets a +44 increase in my total value. This leaves me with sufficient Brick and other resources, while Ore remains high-value. Since the game ends after this turn, securing this profit is optimal. \n\n[Accept]",
