I want to trade my lower value resources for higher value resources. I previously offered 2 Wheat, 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, which was rejected.\n\nMy current resource values:\nWheat: 6\nWood: 8\nSheep: 13\nBrick: 28\nOre: 34\n\nI will try to get some Ore.\nI have a decent amount of Sheep and Wood. I still want Ore.\n\nProposal: Offer 3 Sheep, 1 Wood (3*13 + 8 = 39+8 = 47) for 1 Ore (34). This is a loss for me, but maybe Player 1 needs Sheep/Wood.\nLet's try to improve my existing resource ratios.\n\nI have 20 Wheat, 20 Sheep, 16 Wood, 16 Brick, 19 Ore.\nMy current total value is (20*6) + (16*8) + (20*13) + (16*28) + (19*34) = 120 + 128 + 260 + 448 + 646 = 1602.\nMy previous total value was 1596. So I increased my value with the last trade by 6.\n\nLet's look at Player 1's previous offers:\n- 3 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 5 Wheat (rejected by P0, Off: 3*13+3*8 = 39+24 = 63, Req: 5*6 = 30) - This was a bad offer from P1 for themselves but good for me.\n- 1 Brick, 1 Ore -> 5 Wheat (rejected by P0, Off: 28+34 = 62, Req: 5*6 = 30) - This was a very bad offer from P1.\n- 3 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore (rejected by P0, Off: 63, Req: 34) - This was a good offer for me.\n- 3 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore (rejected by P0, Off: 3*13+2*8 = 39+16 = 55, Req: 34) - This was a good offer for me.\n- 1 Brick -> 3 Wheat (current offer from P1, Off: 28, Req: 18) - This is a bad offer for me.\n\nPlayer 1 seems to want Wheat, Brick, and Ore, and is willing to give Sheep and Wood.\nPlayer 1 has more Brick than me, but less Sheep and Wood.\n\nI have plenty of Sheep (20) and Wheat (20). I could use more Ore.\nI will look for an offer where I can gain value.\n\nIf P1 wants Wheat and Brick (from their offers), maybe they would be willing to give Ore for it.\nMy Brick value is 28, Ore is 34.\nI want to get Ore.\nI will try to offer Wheat and Sheep for Ore.\n\nI'll try a small trade to gain value or balance resources.\nI have 20 Wheat and 20 Sheep.\nI could offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat (13+6 = 19) for 1 Wood (8). This doesn't make sense.\nI want to trade low value for high value.\n\nPerhaps 2 Sheep (26) for 1 Brick (28). This is good for me.\nOr 2 Wheat (12) for 1 Wood (8). This is not good.\n\nI have plenty of Wood and Sheep.\nLet's try to get Ore again. Last offer of 2 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore (12+26=38 -> 34) was rejected. It was a slight gain for me.\n\nPlayer 1 offered 3 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore earlier (55 -> 34). This was a good deal for me, but it was a big loss for Player 1, so I rejected.\n\nI will offer something that helps me increase my higher value resources.\nI will try to get more Ore or Brick.\n\nMy offer for Player 1 is: 1 Brick (28) -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wood (13*2+8 = 26+8=34). Player 1 accepted this last turn. I gained 6 value and got rid of Brick. This was a good trade.\nWait, I already made this offer and it was accepted. This is good! My current resources reflect this trade.\n\nSo Player 1 has 18 Brick and I have 16 Brick.\nPlayer 1 has 14 Wood and 16 Sheep. I have 16 Wood and 20 Sheep.\n\nI still have a lot of Sheep. 20.\nLet's try to trade Sheep for Ore.\nValue of 1 Ore is 34. Value of 1 Sheep is 13.\nI could offer 3 Sheep (3*13 = 39) for 1 Ore (34). This is a loss of 5 value.\nI could offer 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat (2*13+6 = 32) for 1 Ore (34). This is a gain of 2 value for me. I tried 2 Wheat, 2 Sheep for 1 Ore earlier.\n\nLet's try an offer that is fair or slightly beneficial to Player 1 if they seem desperate for resources.\nGiven Player 1's current offer of 1 Brick -> 3 Wheat (28->18), they seem to want Wheat, which I have.\n\nMy current offer strategy is to get Ore or Brick by giving away excess low-value items.\nI'm willing to give 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat (value 32) for 1 Ore (value 34). This makes value sense.\nI have 20 Sheep and 20 Wheat. I can afford this.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
