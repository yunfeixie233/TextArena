      "response": "Given the goal to maximize my total resource value, I analyze the previous interactions. Player 1 has consistently rejected offers focused on Brick, especially Sheep for Brick trades like 5 Sheep for 4 Brick (which would give me a +25 value gain). Their counteroffers involved trying to acquire my high-value Brick and Sheep with low-value Wheat and Wood, which I rejected due to value loss. Since Brick holds high value for me (25 per unit) while Sheep is medium (15 per unit), a direct 1:1 trade\u20141 Sheep for 1 Brick\u2014is prudent. It guarantees a modest gain (+10 value) without overextending, and its simplicity may appeal after repeated rejections.  \n\n**Offer:** [Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",
