      "response": "[Deny]  \nAfter reviewing your offer, I don't see a net gain in value for my resources. I'm still interested in trading, but I need a deal that benefits both of us. I notice you're seeking Brick and Ore, so here's a revised proposal:  \n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 4 Ore]  \n\n### Explanation:  \n- **My rationale**: I value Brick at 24 each and Ore at 33 each. This trade gives me a net value gain of **+12** (losing 5 Brick @ 120 total, gaining 4 Ore @ 132 total).  \n- **Flexibility**: If you prefer other combinations (e.g., including Sheep or Wood), counter with a balanced offer.  \n- **Goal**: My priority is acquiring higher-value resources (Ore/Brick). I\u2019m open to offers aligning with this.  \n\nLet me know if we can find synergy! \ud83d\ude80",
