      "response": "### Initial Analysis\n\n**Current Holdings:**\n- **Wheat**: 20 units at 6 value each \u2192 Total value = 120\n- **Wood**: 11 units at 11 value each \u2192 Total value = 121\n- **Sheep**: 7 units at 18 value each \u2192 Total value = 126\n- **Brick**: 20 units at 22 value each \u2192 Total value = 440\n- **Ore**: 17 units at 33 value each \u2192 Total value = 561\n\n**Total Current Value**: 120 + 121 + 126 + 440 + 561 = **1,368**\n\n**Observations:**\n- **Ore** has the highest per-unit value (33). I have 17, which is a good amount but not excessively so.\n- **Brick** is next at 22 per unit, and I have 20\u2014quite a lot. This might be a good candidate to trade away if I can get higher-value resources.\n- **Sheep** is at 18, but I only have 7, so they're quite valuable.\n- **Wood** is at 11, and I have 11\u2014not too much or too little.\n- **Wheat** is the least valuable at 6, and I have a ton (20). This seems ripe for trading away since its per-unit value is low.\n\n**Trade Strategy:**\n- **Goal**: Increase total value by trading low-value (Wheat, Wood) or excess high-value (Brick) resources for higher-value ones (Ore, Sheep, or more Wood if it's valued higher than my less valuable ones).\n- **Wheat**: Very abundant and low value. I can spare some for higher-value resources.\n- **Brick**: High value but I have a lot\u2014might be able to trade some for even higher-value Ore or more Sheep.\n- **Sheep**: High value and not too many\u2014should avoid trading these away unless for a great deal.\n- **Ore**: Highest value and I have a decent amount\u2014might not want to trade these unless getting multiples of lower-value resources in return.\n\n**First Turn Approach**:\n- Offer to trade some Wheat for something more valuable. Wheat has the lowest per-unit value, so it's easiest to trade away.\n- Maybe offer Wheat for Ore or Brick/Sheep to improve value density.\n  \n### First Offer\n\nI have 20 Wheat at 6 each. Trading away some for higher-value resources makes sense. \n\n**Possible Offers:**\n1. Offer Wheat for Ore: 2 Wheat (12 value) for 1 Ore (33 value). This is a bad deal for the opponent (they lose 33 for 12), so unlikely to be accepted. Need to be more reasonable.\n2. Offer Wheat for Brick: 3 Wheat (18 value) for 1 Brick (22 value). Closer\u2014they lose 22 for 18 but it's more balanced.\n3. Offer Wheat for Sheep: 2 Wheat (12 value) for 1 Sheep (18 value). They lose 18 for 12\u2014still slightly worse for them.\n  \nGiven that, a more balanced trade might involve trading multiple low-value for one higher-value where the count compensates the per-unit difference.\n\n**Reasonable First Offer:**\n- Trade 4 Wheat (24 value) for 1 Brick (22 value). This is slightly in my favor (net -2 for them), but not too bad.\n  \nHowever, since the goal is to increase my total value, trades should be such that the total value I receive is higher than what I give. \n\nAn alternative is to bundle Wheat and Brick to get higher-value items. For example:\n- Give 5 Wheat (30) and 2 Brick (44) \u2192 74 total offered; want in return say 2 Ore (66) and 1 Sheep (18) \u2192 84 total received. Net +10 for me, but this seems complex for a first offer.\n\n**Simpler First Offer:**\nTrade a bundle of Wheat for Ore to concentrate value:\n- [Offer: 3 Wheat (18), 1 Wood (11) \u2192 1 Ore (33)]\n\nBut 3 Wheat + 1 Wood = 29 value for 1 Ore = 33. Net +4 for me, but the opponent gets 29 for 33. Might be acceptable.\n\nBut maybe better to offer more Wheat for Ore to make it seem better:\n- [Offer: 5 Wheat (30) \u2192 1 Ore (33)] \n\nThis is 30 for 33. Opponent gets 30 for theirs, but it's a 3-point gain for me net. It's not terrible, but the opponent might see they're giving up higher-value Ore.\n\n**Another Approach:**\nSince I have a lot of Brick (20 at 22), and Ore is highest at 33, maybe offer Brick for Ore at a slight loss to me in per-unit to concentrate value.\n\n- [Offer: 2 Brick (44) \u2192 2 Ore (66)] \nThis would be great for me, but the opponent likely won't give 2 Ore (66) for 2 Brick (44).\n\nPerhaps:\n- [Offer: 3 Brick (66) \u2192 2 Ore (66)] \u2014 same total value, but this doesn't help me increase total value.\n  \n**Best First Offer:**\nGiven the above, the most reasonable first offer that slightly increases my total value is trading Wheat for Ore at a ratio that benefits me:\n\n- [Offer: 6 Wheat (36) \u2192 1 Ore (33)] \u2014 this is 36 for 33, which is a net loss per trade, but if I do it multiple times, I can reduce excess low-value Wheat.\n\nHmm, this actually decreases total value. I think I need to re-evaluate.\n\n**Re-evaluate:**\nActually, I should aim to trade resources where I give less total value than I receive. \n\nCurrent holdings:\n- Wheat: 20 at 6 (too much) \u2192 try to trade away for higher-value\n- Brick: 20 at 22 \u2192 might have excess\n\nAn offer where I give some Wheat and receive something higher would be good.\n\nExample:\n- [Offer: 4 Wheat (24) \u2192 1 Brick (22)] \nThis is 24 for 22, net -2 for me. Doesn't help.\n\nAlternative:\n- [Offer: 3 Wheat (18), 1 Brick (22) \u2192 2 Sheep (36)] \n18+22=40 for 36. Net -4 worse.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe the initial approach should be to trade excess Brick for higher-value Ore.\n\n- [Offer: 2 Brick (44) \u2192 1 Ore (33)] \u2014 44 for 33, bad for me.\n\nThis doesn't seem to work for increasing my value. Maybe the way is to trade multiple low-value for one higher-value, accepting a small loss per unit to concentrate value into fewer high-value items.\n\nFor example:\n- Give 5 Wheat (30) and get 1 Brick (22) \u2014 30 for 22, and I'm left with 15 Wheat and 21 Brick. This is a net loss of value but concentrates into Brick which is higher per unit.\n\nThis seems counterproductive for total value. Maybe the game expects trades to be balanced in value but allowing me to trade away excess quantities.\n\n**Better Strategy:**\nPerhaps the aim is to trade in a way that I trade more of a resource I have excess for a higher-value one, even if per-unit is worse, because I have less of that higher-value type afterward.\n\nGiven I have 20 Brick at 22 and want more Ore at 33, and I have 20 Wheat at 6:\n\nMaybe offer:\n[Offer: 10 Wheat (60) \u2192 2 Ore (66)] \u2014 60 for 66. Net +6 for me.\n\nThis seems fairer and benefits me value-wise.\n\n### Optimal First Offer\n\nAfter reconsidering, a balanced trade that increases my total value is:\n\n**[Offer: 10 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 2 Ore]**\n\nThis gives 10 Wheat (60 value) for 2 Ore (66 value), a net increase of 6 in total value for me. It's 60 vs 66, so the opponent is effectively trading 2 Ore for 5 each, which is below their 33 value, but since I have so much Wheat, this might be acceptable.\n\nHowever, the required format is \"[Offer: X Sheep, Y Ore -> Z Brick, W Sheep]\" etc., so I need to specify quantities in Offer.\n\nThus, the offer would be:\n\n[Offer: 0 Sheep, 0 Ore -> 0 Brick, 0 Sheep]\n\nBut that means nothing. The format is [Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]. \n\nSo for 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore, since Wheat and Ore aren't in the template, this seems impossible. The template only lists Sheep and Ore in the example.\n\nWait, the resources are Wheat, Wood, Sheep, Brick, Ore. But the offer seems to list some subset, likely Sheep and Ore as they're in the example.\n\nLooking back: \"[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]\" \u2014 this shows it can include Sheep, Ore, Brick in the offer.\n\nThus, for 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore, it's not directly possible unless Wheat is part of the offer. The example shows the offer includes quantities of Sheep and Ore given, and Brick and Sheep requested.\n\nThis implies only certain resources can be offered/received. This seems restrictive.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"Use the following special tokens for actions...-listing quantities of resources, and the format shows Sheep and Ore on the left, Brick and Sheep on right.\"\n\nThis suggests the offer format is limited to listing quantities of specific resources: Sheep and/or Ore on the left, Brick and/or Sheep on the right.\n\nThus, I cannot offer Wheat directly in the offer. \n\nThis changes things. My available resources for the offer are restricted to what can be in the format: \n\n[Offer: A Sheep, B Ore -> C Brick, D Sheep]\n\nSo only Sheep, Ore, Brick can be in offers\u2014no Wheat or Wood.\n\nGiven that, my current holdings include:\n- Sheep: 7\n- Ore: 17\n- Brick: 20\n\nThus, I can:\n- Offer Sheep and/or Ore to receive Brick and/or Sheep.\n- Or offer to give/receive Brick and/or Sheep for Sheep and/or Ore.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\nSince I cannot use Wheat or Wood in offers, my available trade resources are Sheep (18 value), Ore (33 value), Brick (22 value).\n\nGiven:\n- High Ore value (33) and I have 17\u2014might consider trading some for Brick (22) or more Sheep (18), but net value per trade would decrease.\n- Brick is 22 and I have 20\u2014might trade Brick for Ore or Sheep, but that would give me lower-value items.\nWait, this seems problematic.\n\nLet me recalculate possible trades:\n\nCurrent:\n- Sheep: 7 at 18 \u2192 total 126\n- Ore: 17 at 33 \u2192 total 561\n- Brick: 20 at 22 \u2192 total 440\n\nPossible offers:\n1. Give Ore for Brick:\n   e.g., [Offer: 3 Ore, 0 Sheep -> 4 Brick, 0 Sheep] \u2014 3*33 = 99 for 4*22 = 88. Net -11 per trade. Bad.\n2. Give Brick for Ore:\n   e.g., [Offer: 4 Brick, 0 Ore -> 3 Ore, 0 Sheep] \u2014 4*22 = 88 for 3*33 = 99. Net +11 per trade. This seems good.\n3. Give Ore for Sheep:\n   e.g., [Offer: 2 Ore, 0 Sheep -> 0 Brick, 4 Sheep] \u2014 2*33 = 66 for 4*18 = 72. Net +6 per trade. Also good.\n4. Give Sheep for Brick:\n   e.g., [Offer: 3 Sheep, 0 Ore -> 4 Brick, 0 Sheep] \u2014 3*18 = 54 for 4*22 = 88. Net +34 per trade. Best.\n\nThus, the best per-trade value increase is giving Sheep for Brick: 3 Sheep for 4 Brick gives +34 value.\n\nGiven I have 7 Sheep, I could do this once, then have 4 Sheep, 24 Brick, 17 Ore.\n\nBut since I have only 7 Sheep, can do:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 0 Ore -> 4 Brick, 0 Sheep]\n\nThis increases my total value by 34 (3 Sheep = 54 given, 4 Brick = 88 received). \n\nThen next turn could do [Offer: 4 Sheep, 0 Ore -> 5 Brick, 0 Sheep] (4 Sheep = 72 for 5 Brick = 110, +38), but I only have 4 left after first trade, so 4-4=0 Sheep left.\n\nAlternatively, do smaller increments, but the first seems optimal.\n\n### Final First Offer\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 0 Ore -> 4 Brick, 0 Sheep]",

Turn low-value Wheat (6) into higher-value Ore (33).  \n2. Alternatively, turn mid-value Brick (22) into even higher-value Ore (33).\n\nA simple ratio check:  \n5 Wheat + 1 Brick for 2 Ore is +7 (\u221230 \u221222 + 66).  \nThat is **positive +14**, yet still moderate so the opponent might accept.\n\nTherefore my next offer will be:\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 2 Ore]",
