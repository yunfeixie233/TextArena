I want to increase my valuable resources.\nPlayer 1 rejected my previous offer of 10 Wood for 2 Ore, which suggests they value Wood highly. I also have no Wood left to offer.\nPlayer 1 previously offered 5 Sheep for 3 Ore, which I accepted. This means they are interested in trading Sheep for Ore. I only have 1 Sheep left, so I cannot offer Sheep.\n\nI will try to trade some Ore for Sheep or Wood. Since I have a lot of Ore, I can afford to offer a bit more for less valuable resources if it helps me balance my portfolio.\n\n[Offer: 3 Ore -> 5 Sheep]",
