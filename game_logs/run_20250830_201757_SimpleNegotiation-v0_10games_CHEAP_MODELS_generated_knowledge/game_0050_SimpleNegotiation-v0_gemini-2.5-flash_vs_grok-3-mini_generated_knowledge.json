Perhaps I can trade some Sheep for Brick or Ore.\nSheep value: 14\nBrick value: 28\nOre value: 37\n\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (value 28) for 1 Brick (value 28), it's a neutral trade in terms of value. But it allows me to diversify my resources.\n\nConsidering Player 1 just offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, perhaps they are low on Ore or highly value Sheep.\n\nLet me make an offer that is slightly more favorable to me than Player 1's last offer, but still potentially appealing to them.\nPlayer 1 offered 1 Ore (37) for 5 Wood (40) and 10 Wheat (60). Denied.\nThis means Player 1 values Wood and Wheat highly, or is trying to get rid of Ore.\n\nMy last offer: 8 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore. Accepted.\nValue offered: (8*6) + (5*8) = 48 + 40 = 88\nValue received: 28 + 37 = 65\nThis was a bad trade for me, I lost value. I need to be more careful.\n\nLet's look at the current offer from Player 1: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore.\nMy value loss: 28 (sheep) - 37 (ore) = -9. I deny this.\n\nI have 11 Wheat, 19 Wood, 17 Sheep, 14 Brick, 13 Ore.\nI want to increase my valuable resources (Brick, Ore) without losing overall value.\n\nWhat if I try to get more Ore?\nOffer: 2 Sheep (value 28) -> 1 Ore (value 37).

My previous offer of 2 Sheep for 1 Ore was rejected, which suggests that Player 1 values Ore highly, and probably also values Sheep. I am interested in acquiring more Ore and Brick. I have plenty of Wheat and Wood. Player 1's last offer was 4 Wheat (Value 24), 2 Wood (Value 16) = 40 for 1 Ore (Value 37). This is a fair offer but I am not in need of Wheat and Wood.\n\nI have 19 Wheat, 24 Wood, 17 Sheep, 13 Brick, 12 Ore.\n\nI have accepted two of my offers so far, both involved trading Wheat and Wood for Brick and Ore, which indicates Player 1 may be interested in these. Player 1 is also offering Wheat and Wood in exchange for Ore.\nGiven my last offer of 2 Sheep for 1 Ore was rejected by P1 (Value 28 for 37), and P1 then countered with 4 Wheat, 2 Wood for 1 Ore (Value 40 for 37), P1 clearly values Ore more than I value Sheep.\nI also observe that Player 1 is consistently asking for Ore. I currently have 12 Ore. I should be careful not to trade away too much Ore if I am unable to acquire it back.\n\nI need more Brick and Ore. My goal is to increase my total value.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, since Player 1 consistently seeks it.\nPerhaps I can offer Sheep.\nSheep value: 14. Ore value: 37.\n2 Sheep = 28. (My earlier offer). Rejected.\n3 Sheep = 42. So 3 Sheep for 1 Ore would be good for me. (42 for 37)\n\nLet's also consider giving up resources I have a lot of like Wheat and Wood.\nWhat about 10 Wheat (60) + 5 Wood (40) = 100 for 1 Ore (37) + 2 Brick (56) = 93. This would be a good deal for me. But I think this would be too high for Player 1 to accept.\n\nI will try to trade Sheep for Ore, but will offer more Sheep this time due to player 1's previous rejection.\nI will offer 3 Sheep for 1 Ore. This is 42 value for 37 value (a gain of 5)\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
