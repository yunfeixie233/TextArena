One potential strategy is to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values or to accumulate resources with high values.\n\nLet's consider a trade:\n- We can offer some Wood (Value: 8) for Ore (Value: 34) since Ore is significantly more valuable.\n\nA potential trade could be: [Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nThis trade involves giving up 4 Wood (4 * 8 = 32) for 1 Ore (1 * 34 = 34), resulting in a net gain of 2.\n\nLet's format this offer according to the game's requirements:\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe action for this turn will be:\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
