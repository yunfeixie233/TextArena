To increase the total value, we need to make trades that are beneficial. We should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or at least maintain the current total value while trying to increase it in subsequent trades.\n\nLet's analyze the resources and their values:\n- Ore is the most valuable resource (Value: 39).\n- We have relatively fewer high-value resources (Wood, Sheep, Brick, Ore) compared to Wheat.\n\n### Trade Offer for Next Turn\n\nTo increase the total value, let's consider offering resources that are less valuable for ones that are more valuable. Since Ore is the most valuable and we have increased our Ore quantity, let's see if we can offer some Wheat or other less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nLet's make an offer:\n- Offered items: 4 Wood, 4 Sheep\n- Requested items: 1 Brick, 2 Ore\n\nThe rationale is to offer resources that are relatively less valuable in combination compared to what we are requesting. Wood (Value: 10) and Sheep (Value: 12) together are being offered for Brick (Value: 23) and Ore (Value: 39). The total value of offered resources is (4*10) + (4*12) = 40 + 48 = 88. The total value of requested resources is (1*23) + (2*39) = 23 + 78 = 101, which is more valuable.\n\nThus, the trade offer is: `[Offer: 4 Wood, 4 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 2 Ore]`.\n\n### Response to Potential Counteroffer or Acceptance\n\nWe will wait for Player 1's response. If they accept, we will adjust our quantities accordingly. If they deny or make a counteroffer, we will reassess and decide on the next step.\n\nFor now, let's wait for Player 1's response to our last offer.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wood, 4 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 2 Ore]`",
