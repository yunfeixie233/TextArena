To achieve this, we need to identify which resources are relatively overvalued or undervalued based on their quantity and value.\n\n1. **Resource Valuation:**\n   - The resources with higher values per unit are Ore (38), Brick (28), Sheep (12), and Wood (12), with Wheat being the lowest (5).\n   - We have a good quantity of Brick and Sheep, a moderate amount of Wood, and a relatively lower quantity of Ore.\n\n2. **Trade Strategy:**\n   - Given the high value of Ore and Brick, we should aim to maintain or increase our quantity of these resources if possible.\n   - We should consider trading resources that are less valuable or in surplus for those that are more valuable or scarce.\n\n3. **First Turn Offer:**\n   - We have 19 Wheat, which is relatively low in value. Trading some Wheat for a more valuable resource could be beneficial.\n   - Let's propose a trade that involves Wheat to gain a more valuable resource.\n\n#### Proposed Trade for Turn 1:\nConsidering the values, let's offer 5 Wheat (total value of 25) to gain a resource of higher value. Since Wood and Sheep are of moderate value and we already have a decent quantity of Sheep, let's aim to trade Wheat for Wood or another valuable resource if the opponent is willing.\n\nLet's make an offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood]`\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood]`\n\n#### Action for Turn 1:\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood]`\n\nThis action is taken to potentially increase our total resource value by trading low-value Wheat for Wood, which is more valuable.

Since you have a good amount of Wheat (low value) and a significant amount of Brick (high value), you could consider trading some Wheat or other lower-value resources for higher-value ones if possible.\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat for Ore or Brick since they are high in value, or possibly trading some of your less valuable resources (like Wheat or Sheep) for more Wood, Brick, or Ore.\n\nOne potential trade could be:\n- Offering 4 Sheep (Value: 12 each) for 1 Ore (Value: 38). \n  - You give up: 4 * 12 = 48\n  - You get: 1 * 38 = 38\n  This isn't beneficial as you're losing value.\n\nLet's think of another:\n- Offering 3 Wheat (Value: 5 each) for 1 Brick (Value: 28).\n  - You give up: 3 * 5 = 15\n  - You get: 1 * 28 = 28\n  This is a gain as you're getting more value than you're giving up.\n\nThus, a potential offer: [Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\n\nYour move: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`",

I offered 5 Wheat for 1 Wood, and it was accepted. This increased my total value (since 1 Wood = 12 value, and 5 Wheat = 25 value, it was not a good trade in terms of value but improved my resource diversity).\n2. I offered 3 Wheat for 1 Brick, and it was accepted. This also increased my Brick quantity (since 3 Wheat = 15 value, and 1 Brick = 28 value, this was a good trade).\n\n### Next Trade Strategy\n\nTo maximize my total value, I need to identify resources that are undervalued in my current portfolio and try to acquire more of the higher-value resources or maintain a good balance.\n\nMy current highest value resources are Brick and Ore. I have successfully increased my Brick quantity. Now, I should consider trades that could potentially increase my Ore or maintain a good balance.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n\nI will examine potential trades that could benefit me:\n- Offering Wheat (low value) for Ore (high value) could be beneficial.\n- My current quantity of Wheat is 11, which is still relatively high.\n\nLet's propose a trade:\n- Offer 4 Wheat (value = 20) for 1 Ore (value = 38). This would be a beneficial trade as it increases my total value.\n\nThus, my next action will be:\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`",

      "response": "### Current State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, let's first analyze the current state of resources after the last trade.\n\nInitially, Player 0 had:\n- Wheat: 19 units, Value: 5\n- Wood: 9 units, Value: 12\n- Sheep: 12 units, Value: 12\n- Brick: 14 units, Value: 28\n- Ore: 6 units, Value: 38\n\nAfter the trades:\n1. Offered 5 Wheat -> Requested 1 Wood\n   - Wheat: 19 - 5 = 14\n   - Wood: 9 + 1 = 10\n\n2. Offered 3 Wheat -> Requested 1 Brick\n   - Wheat: 14 - 3 = 11\n   - Brick: 14 + 1 = 15\n\n3. Offered 4 Wheat -> Requested 1 Ore\n   - Wheat: 11 - 4 = 7\n   - Ore: 6 + 1 = 7\n\n4. Offered 2 Wheat -> Requested 1 Brick\n   - Wheat: 7 - 2 = 5\n   - Brick: 15 + 1 = 16\n\nCurrent State:\n- Wheat: 5 units\n- Wood: 10 units\n- Sheep: 12 units\n- Brick: 16 units\n- Ore: 7 units\n\n### Resource Valuation\n\nLet's calculate the total value of the resources currently held:\n- Wheat: 5 units * 5 = 25\n- Wood: 10 units * 12 = 120\n- Sheep: 12 units * 12 = 144\n- Brick: 16 units * 28 = 448\n- Ore: 7 units * 38 = 266\n\nTotal Value = 25 + 120 + 144 + 448 + 266 = 1003\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\n\nTo maximize the total value, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or at least maintain the current value while optimizing the resource distribution for potential future trades.\n\nGiven the current state and values, Wheat is the lowest value resource. We have already traded a significant amount of Wheat. Let's consider trading some Sheep (Value: 12) or Wood (Value: 12) for a resource that could potentially be more valuable or useful.\n\nSince Player 1 has accepted all previous offers involving Wheat, let's examine the possibility of offering Sheep or Wood for higher-value resources like Ore or Brick.\n\n### Trade Offer for Next Turn\n\nLet's propose a trade:\n- Offer 2 Sheep -> Request 1 Ore\n\nRationale:\n- Sheep is valued at 12, so 2 Sheep = 24\n- Ore is valued at 38, so 1 Ore = 38\n- This trade increases the total value (24 for 38)\n\nThe proposed trade offer is: `[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`",
