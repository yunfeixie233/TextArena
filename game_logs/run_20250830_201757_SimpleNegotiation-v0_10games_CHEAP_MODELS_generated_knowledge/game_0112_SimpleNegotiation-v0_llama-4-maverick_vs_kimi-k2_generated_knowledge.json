I could try to trade some of these for more valuable resources if possible.\n\nLet's formulate a trade offer. Since I have a good amount of Wood (Value: 8) and Wheat (Value: 5), I could offer some of these for a more valuable resource. For example, I could offer some Wheat and Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's make an offer: \n- I have 21 Wheat and 19 Wood. Offering 5 Wheat (Value: 25) and 3 Wood (Value: 24) gives a total value of 49. \n- I could request 2 Brick (Value: 48), which is roughly equivalent in value.\n\nSo, my offer could be: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]`.\n\nThis is my first move: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]`.",
