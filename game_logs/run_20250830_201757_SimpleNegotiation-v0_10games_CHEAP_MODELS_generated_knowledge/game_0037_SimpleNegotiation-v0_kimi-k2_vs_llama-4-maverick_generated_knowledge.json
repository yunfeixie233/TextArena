      "response": "## Step 1: Assess the current resources and their values.\nThe current resources and their values are: Wheat (Qty: 13, Value: 5), Wood (Qty: 8, Value: 10), Sheep (Qty: 17, Value: 17), Brick (Qty: 5, Value: 27), Ore (Qty: 6, Value: 36).\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the previous trade offer made to Player 0.\nThe offer made was 4 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore. The total value of the offered resources is (4 * 5) + (3 * 17) = 20 + 51 = 71. The total value of the requested resources is (2 * 27) + (1 * 36) = 54 + 36 = 90.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the outcome of the previous trade offer.\nThe trade offer was rejected by Player 0. This means the resources were not exchanged.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the current total value of resources.\nTo calculate the total value: (13 * 5) + (8 * 10) + (17 * 17) + (5 * 27) + (6 * 36) = 65 + 80 + 289 + 135 + 216 = 785.\n\n## Step 5: Consider potential trades based on the current resources and their values.\nSince the last offer was rejected, we need to think of alternative trades. We should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value if possible.\n\n## Step 6: Identify resources that could be traded.\nWheat (Value: 5) is the lowest value resource. Wood (Value: 10) is the next lowest. We could consider trading these for higher value resources like Brick (Value: 27) or Ore (Value: 36).\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a new trade offer.\nLet's consider trading Wheat and/or Wood for Brick or Ore. A potential trade could be: Offer 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick, 0 Ore (or other combinations). However, we should directly aim for a more valuable trade. For instance, trading some Sheep (Value: 17) for Ore (Value: 36) or Brick (Value: 27) could be beneficial if the terms are right.\n\n## Step 8: Propose a specific trade offer.\nLet's think about trading some of our lower-value resources or even Sheep for higher-value resources. One possible trade is: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]. The value given is (4*5) + (1*10) = 20 + 10 = 30, and the value received is 1*36 = 36. This is a gain.\n\n## Step 9: Format the proposed trade offer according to the game's special tokens.\nThe proposed trade is: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore].\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]}$",

Our total value has decreased slightly due to the trades made.\n\n2. **Determine the Goal**: The goal is to increase the total value of resources.\n\n3. **Propose a New Trade**:\n   - We should look to trade resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable.\n   - We have a relatively high quantity of Sheep (Value: 17), and we have lost some Wheat and Wood in previous trades.\n   - Ore (Value: 36) is valuable, and we have gained some in the last trades.\n\n4. **Formulate a Trade Offer**:\n   - Considering the values, offering Sheep for Ore or Brick could be beneficial since Ore and Brick have higher values.\n   - Let's propose: '[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.\n\n   Calculation:  \n   - Giving up 2 Sheep = 2 * 17 = 34  \n   - Requesting 1 Ore = 1 * 36 = 36  \n   - Net gain = 36 - 34 = 2\n\n   This trade seems slightly beneficial.\n\n### Action\n\nLet's make the trade offer: '[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThe response will be based on the opponent's reaction.\n\n### Response Format:\n\n'[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'",
