      "response": "Thought process (private):\n\n1. First, calculate each resource\u2019s value per unit:\n   - Wheat: 5 value / 7 units \u2248 0.714 per Wheat\n   - Wood: 9 value / 7 units \u2248 1.286 per Wood\n   - Sheep: 18 value / 16 units \u2248 1.125\n   - Brick: 28 value / 13 units \u2248 2.154\n   - Ore: 37 value / 15 units \u2248 2.467\n\n2. Total current value in hand:\n   5 + 9 + 18 + 28 + 37 = 97 points.\n\n3. Identify the most valuable resource per unit: Ore (\u22482.467). Second: Brick (\u22482.154).  \n   These are our best \u201cselling assets,\u201d i.e., we get more points per unit traded away.\n\n4. Identify the least valuable resource per unit: Wheat (\u22480.714), followed by Sheep (\u22481.125).  \n   These are prime targets to acquire in trades (as cheaply as possible).\n\n5. Therefore a good trade for me would give away one Ore (worth 2.467) for MORE total value in Wheat/Sheep, or give away one Brick for more value in Wheat/Sheep.\n\n6. Practical rule-of-thumb: if in exchange I give away 1You asked me to explicitly output a concrete continuation of the turn using the required formatting, so the saleable assets are the Ore and the Brick.  \n   Idea: offer a small chunk of Brick or Ore in return for mostly Wheat and/or Sheep.\n\n7. Example Initiative offer:\n   Give away 2 Brick (2*28/13 \u2248 4.308 points worth)  \n   Ask for 4 Wheat (4*5/7 \u2248 2.858 points worth) and 1 Sheep (1*18/16 \u2248 1.125 points worth)  \n   Total given away \u2248 4.308  \n   Total received \u2248 3.983  \n   Net loss \u2248 0.325; conservatively bad.\n\n8. More aggressive value gain:\n   Give away 1 Brick (\u22482.154)  \n   Ask for 1 Ore (\u22482.467)  \n   Net win \u2248 0.313 points.  \n   But I\u2019d just be swapping two already-valuable goods \u2013 minimal gain and unlikely opponent accepts.\n\n9. Another angle: give multiple Sheep, get Ore at slight profit.\n   Give 3 Sheep (3\u00d71.125 \u2248 3.375) for 1 Ore (\u22482.467) \u2192 I LOSE value. Bad.\n\n10. Sweet-spot expression: give 2 Ore (\u2248 4.934) for 3 Wheat + 3 Sheep (\u2248 2.142 + 3.375 = 5.517).  \n    Net gain \u2248 0.583 points and depletes Ore, but is it believable for opponent?  \n    Perhaps a little heavy-handed on first turn.\n\n11. Instead, open negotiations gently with:\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick, 1 Sheep]\n\nCheck value balance:\n   I give: 2\u204415 of 37 \u2248 4.934 points  \n   I get:\n        3\u204413 of 28 \u2248 6.462\n        1\u204416 of 18 =      1.125\n                       -------    \n                       \u2248 7.587\n   Net gain \u2248 2.653 points.  \n   This is attractive for me; for the opponent it means they get 4.934 points of Ore for only 7.587 points of goods \u2013 probably slightly un-favourable to them, but it is a plausible negotiation opener.\n\nConcrete next step:\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick, 1 Sheep]",
