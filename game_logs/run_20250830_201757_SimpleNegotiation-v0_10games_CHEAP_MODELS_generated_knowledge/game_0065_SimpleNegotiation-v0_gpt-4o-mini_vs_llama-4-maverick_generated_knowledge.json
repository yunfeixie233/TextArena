They accepted our offer of 4 Sheep for 1 Ore, indicating they might be interested in Sheep. They initially offered Ore for Brick, suggesting they need Brick or are willing to give up Ore for it.\n\n### New Trade Offer\n\nLet's consider offering some Sheep (since they are willing to trade for it) and see if we can get something more valuable.\n\nCurrent quantities:\n- Sheep: 19\n- Ore: 7 (high value)\n\n**Proposed Trade**: Offer 3 Sheep -> Request 1 Brick\n\nValue given: 3 * 15 = 45  \nValue received: 1 * 25 = 25 (This is not beneficial as it decreases our total value. Let's think of another trade.)\n\nAlternative:\n**Proposed Trade**: Offer 2 Sheep -> Request 1 Ore\n\nValue given: 2 * 15 = 30  \nValue received: 1 * 38 = 38 (This is beneficial as it increases our total value.)\n\nLet's make this trade offer.\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
