One potential trade could involve offering Wheat (low value) for Brick or Ore (higher value), but we already have a lot of Ore.\n\nConsidering our resources and values, one potential trade is to offer some Wheat for Brick since Brick has a higher value than Wheat and we're currently low on Brick.\n\nLet's make an offer: \n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 4 Brick]\n\nThis offer gives away some Wheat (lower value resource we have in abundance after the last trade) in exchange for Brick (a higher value resource we're lacking).\n\nSo, the action is: [Offer: 8 Wheat -> 4 Brick]",

We have:\n- 9 Wheat (total value = 54)\n- 4 Wood (total value = 44)\nWe could offer some of these for Brick or Ore.

      "response": "### Step 1: Understand the Current State\n- I am Player 1 in the Negotiation Game.\n- My current resources and their values are:\n  - [Wheat] Qty: 19 - 10 = 9, Value: 6\n  - [Wood] Qty: 9 - 5 = 4, Value: 11\n  - [Sheep] Qty: 16, Value: 13\n  - [Brick] Qty: 13 + 10 = 23, Value: 22\n  - [Ore] Qty: 22, Value: 39\n- The game is in its 5th turn since we've had 5 turns of interactions (acceptance and subsequent offers).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Previous Turns\n- Player 0 initially offered 10 Brick for 10 Wheat and 5 Wood, which I accepted.\n- My subsequent offers were either rejected or not countered by Player 0.\n- I've been trying to negotiate trades but haven't been successful after the initial acceptance.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Current Resources and Values\n- The total value of my current resources is:\n  - Wheat: 9 * 6 = 54\n  - Wood: 4 * 11 = 44\n  - Sheep: 16 * 13 = 208\n  - Brick: 23 * 22 = 506\n  - Ore: 22 * 39 = 858\n- Total value = 54 + 44 + 208 + 506 + 858 = 1670\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Best Course of Action\n- To increase the total value, I need to consider what resources are valuable and what I can offer.\n- Ore is the most valuable resource, and I have a significant amount.\n- I should look to trade resources that are less valuable for more valuable ones or maintain my current valuable resources.\n\n### Step 5: Formulate a Trade Offer\n- Considering my resources, offering some Wheat (least valuable among my resources) for something more valuable could be a good start.\n- However, my previous offers to trade Wheat for Brick or Ore were rejected.\n- Let's analyze the values again and consider offering a different resource.\n\n### Step 6: Make a New Offer\n- I will offer some Wood (since I have a relatively low quantity and it's not the most valuable) or Sheep for a more valuable resource.\n- Let's try: '[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' because Sheep is moderately valuable and Ore is very valuable. This could be a good trade.\n\n### Action\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
