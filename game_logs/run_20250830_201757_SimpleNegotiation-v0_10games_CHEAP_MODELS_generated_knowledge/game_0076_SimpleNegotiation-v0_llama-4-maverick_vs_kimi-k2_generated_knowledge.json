Identify resources that are relatively overvalued or undervalued based on their quantity and value.\n2. Formulate trade offers that aim to exchange resources of lower value for those of higher value, or to balance quantities if a surplus or deficit is identified.\n\n### Current Resource Valuation\n- The resources with the highest values per unit are Ore (33) and Brick (30), indicating they are highly valued.\n- Sheep (16) and Wood (9) are moderately valued.\n- Wheat (5) is the lowest valued resource.\n\n### Trade Strategy for Turn 1\nTo start, we should look to trade resources that are either abundant and low in value or less abundant but still relatively low in value for resources that are high in value or scarce.\n\n### First Trade Offer\nWe can start by offering Wheat (low value) in exchange for a resource that is either equally or more valuable.\n\nLet's consider offering Wheat for Wood, as Wood is more valuable than Wheat.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n- Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood (since 1 Wood = 9 value, and 5 Wheat = 5 value, this is a favorable trade for us as we gain 4 value units)\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood]`\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.",

The game is on the 6th turn since we've had 5 turns of offers and counter-offers.\n2. We need to think about the next trade offer.\n\nTo increase the total value of resources, we should think about trading resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but more quantity.\n\nLet's consider making a new offer. We can think about trading some Wheat (Value: 5) for Wood (Value: 9), as it increases the total value.\n\nThe current state is:\n- We have 18 Wheat and 13 Wood.\n\nLet's make an offer: Offered items: 3 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Wood\n\nThe action is: [Offer:3 Wheat,0 Wood ->1 Wood,0 Sheep]\n\nCorrected format: [Offer:3 Wheat ->1 Wood]\n\nLet's proceed with the action.\n\n[Offer:3 Wheat ->1 Wood]",
