I gave 5 Brick and received 2 Ore.  \n   Brick: 16 \u2013 5 = 11  \n   Ore: 9 + 2 = 11  \n\n2. I gave 4 Brick + 1 Wood and received 3 Wheat + 2 Sheep.  \n   Brick: 11 \u2013 4 = 7  \n   Wood: 9 \u2013 1 = 8  \n   Wheat: 12 + 3 = 15  \n   Sheep: 7 + 2 = 9  \n\n3.

That is acceptable.\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]",
