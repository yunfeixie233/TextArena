      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to analyze what I have and what I can potentially gain or lose from a trade.\n\nInitially, I have:\n- Wheat: 14 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 16 (Value: 11)\n- Sheep: 24 (Value: 15)\n- Brick: 12 (Value: 24)\n- Ore: 17 (Value: 40)\n\nLet's calculate the total value of my resources:\nTotal Value = (14 * 6) + (16 * 11) + (24 * 15) + (12 * 24) + (17 * 40)\nTotal Value = 84 + 176 + 360 + 288 + 680\nTotal Value = 1588\n\nTo increase my total value, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given my resources, Ore is the most valuable, and Wheat is the least.\n\nSince I have a good quantity of Sheep and Ore, which are relatively valuable, I'll start by looking to trade some of my less valuable resources or those that are not as highly valued but are present in sufficient quantities.\n\nLet's look at potential trades:\n1. I have a lot of Sheep (Value: 15) and could potentially trade some for other resources if they are undervalued relative to Sheep.\n2. Wheat (Value: 6) is the least valuable resource. Trading it for something more valuable could be beneficial.\n\nA potential first offer could involve trading some Wheat or Wood for a resource that is valued higher than both.\n\nLet's make an offer to trade some Wheat for Brick, as Brick is significantly more valuable than Wheat.\n\n'[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Brick]'\n\nThis offer is based on the current valuation, where I'm trading 8 Wheat (Value: 6 each, so 8*6 = 48) for 2 Brick (Value: 24 each, so 2*24 = 48). It doesn't increase my total value but is a starting point for negotiation. If my opponent is willing to give more Brick or less Brick for the same Wheat, it could be a good deal.\n\nLet's see the response from the opponent. \n\nSince I don't have the opponent's response, I will wait for it to decide the next step.\n\nMy action for Turn 1: [Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",

Made an offer to Player 1: 8 Wheat -> 2 Brick. Player 1 rejected it.\n  2. Made another offer to Player 1: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Brick. Player 1 rejected it.\n\n- **Remaining Turns:** 8 turns left.\n\n### Thought Process\n\n1. **Understanding Rejections:** Player 1 rejected both offers that involved exchanging resources for Brick. This indicates that either Player 1 does not have Brick to offer or is not willing to trade Brick for the resources offered.\n\n2. **Resource Valuation:** The resources I have are valued differently. Ore is the most valuable per unit, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat. The goal is to increase the total value of resources.\n\n3. **Trade Strategy:** Since the previous offers were rejected, it's essential to analyze what could be a more appealing trade. Given that Brick is of high value and my previous offers were rejected, it might be worth considering other resources that Player 1 might be willing to trade.\n\n4. **New Offer Consideration:** \n   - I could offer resources of lower value to me and see if I can get a more valuable resource in return.\n   - Since Ore is highly valued, gaining more Ore or keeping it is crucial. Trading away Wheat or Wood might be a good start as they are less valuable.\n\n### New Trade Offer\n\nLet's consider offering some Sheep (Value: 15) for Ore (Value: 40), as this could potentially increase my total resource value.\n\n- **Offer:** 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore\n\nThis is a reasonable trade because giving away 4 Sheep (total value = 4*15 = 60) for 1 Ore (value = 40) might not be beneficial. Let's adjust the offer to be more favorable.\n\n- **Alternative Offer:** 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore\n\nGiving away 2 Sheep (total value = 2*15 = 30) for 1 Ore (value = 40) is a more reasonable trade as it potentially increases my total resource value.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds to this offer.",
