The opponent most likely values goods the same way the rules (or a Catan-style economy) do, so:\n\n- Wheat = 5  \n- Wood = 12  \n- Sheep = 13  \n- Brick = 28  \n- Ore = 34  \n\nRight now my inventory has a total value of\n\n18\u00b75 + 10\u00b712 + 25\u00b713 + 8\u00b728 + 5\u00b734  \n= 90 + 120 + 325 + 224 + 170  \n= 929 points.\n\nI look for the biggest mis-match between how I value a good and the standard value. Brick (28 pts) and Ore (34 pts) are my two highest-valued items, while Wheat (5 pts) is easily my lowest.  \nThus, I\u2019d like to trade away Wheat and/or some Sheep (13) to acquire more Brick and Ore.\n\nThe most straightforward deal is 3-for-1: three of a low-value good for one of a high-value good. Single-card offers reduce hand-size and are easy for the opponent to evaluate.  \nI\u2019ll make the first move with a simple 3 Sheep for 1 Brick proposal, since 3\u00d713 = 39 is slightly more than 28 for Brick, so it looks fair on raw points, but I\u2019m happy to adjust after hearing Player 0\u2019s response.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",
