The worst relative values are Wheat (5 pts) and Sheep (16 pts) with the smallest absolute quantities among the \u201ccheap\u201d resources.\n\nGoal: increase total value via asymmetric trades.\n\nBest things to OFFER are high-quantity, low-value goods (Wheat, Wood).  \nBest things to REQUEST are high-value, scarce goods (Brick, Ore, Sheep).\n\nChecks after the last turn (I denied the 1 Sheep \u21d2 4 Wood offer):\n- My Sheep stock is 8 \u2192 I can give none away for less than 33-value (Ore) or 26-value (Brick).  \n- My Wood is 24 \u2192 trading upward 12-value units for \u226526-value makes sense.\n- My Wheat is 22 \u2192 each 5-value unit can bundle upward.\n\nHigh-value proposal: bundle 1 Wood + 6 Wheat (12+30=42 value) for 1 Ore (33). This yields \u22129 value in face value but locks Ore\u2019s future bargaining power. Instead, try a smaller 0-exchange of 3 resources.\n\nBetter asymmetric trade \u263a  \n4 Wood (48 value) for 1 Ore (33 value) yields +33 \u221248 = \u221215 immediate but the Ore controls all upgrades and this is the tightest direct upward swap.\n\nHowever, we have 24 Wood. Losing 4 Wood keeps me with 20 Wood \u2013 still large.  \nLet me sweeten slightly for higher accept chance.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
