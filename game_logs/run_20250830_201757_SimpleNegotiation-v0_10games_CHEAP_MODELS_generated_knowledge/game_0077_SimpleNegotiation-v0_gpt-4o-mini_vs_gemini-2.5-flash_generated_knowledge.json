I also want to get rid of Wheat as it has the lowest value.\n\nLet's try to make an offer that is beneficial to me. I have a lot of Wheat and some Wood that I might be willing to trade for higher-value items.\n\nConsider trading away Wheat for Ore or Brick.\nIf I offer Wheat, I should try to get at least double or triple the value back if possible.\n\nWhat about offering Wood for Ore or Brick? Wood has a value of 10.\n\nLet's propose an offer where I give up some Wheat and get back some Ore or Brick.\n\nI'm aiming to increase my total value.\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 6 Wheat, 1 Ore -> 5 Brick. The value gain for Player 0 is 105 - 66 = 39. So Player 0 is trying to gain value.\n\nMy goal is to increase my value.\n\nLet's make an offer to gain Ore or Brick.\n\nI have 23 Wheat (115 total value). I have 13 Wood (130 total value).\nI have 16 Brick (336 total value). I have 7 Ore (252 total value).\n\nHow about an offer for ore?\nIf I offer 10 Wheat (value 50) and 2 Wood (value 20), total value 70.\nWhat could I get for that? Maybe 2 Ore (value 72)? That's a tiny gain.\nOr 3 Brick (value 63)? That's a loss.\n\nI need to be careful with the value exchange.\n\nLet's counter the current offer from Player 0. They offered 6 Wheat, 1 Ore -> 5 Brick.\nThey want 5 Brick (value 105) and offer 6 Wheat (30) + 1 Ore (36) = 66.\nThis is a bad deal for me.\n\nI need to make a better offer.\n\nLet's try to get Ore. Ore is the highest value resource.\n\nI have enough Wheat to make a substantial offer.\nWhat if I offer 15 Wheat (value 75) for 2 Ore (value 72)? This is a slight loss for me.\nI need to gain value or at least break even for high-value items.\n\nLet's reconsider what Player 0 might want. They have been asking for Brick and Sheep.\n\nLet's try to acquire Ore.\n\nMy offer should make sense for me.\n\nHow about offering some of my lower value items for higher value items from Player 0?\nThe information I have about Player 0's resources is limited. I only know what they have offered.\n\nLet's make an offer that gets me at least a small gain.\nIf I give 10 Wheat (Value 50), what can I get?\nMaybe 1 Ore (Value 36) and 1 Wood (Value 10) = 46. This is a loss.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood for Ore because Wood is 10 and Ore is 36.\n3 Wood (30) for 1 Ore (36) is a potential gain of 6.\nBut do I have enough Wood to make that kind of trade? I have 13.\n\nLet's offer a combination of lower value resources to get a higher value resource.\nThe most attractive trades are those where I give up resources I have many of and are low value, for resources I have fewer of and are high value.\n\nI have 23 Wheat. I have 16 Brick.\n\nLet's try to acquire Ore.\n\nConsider offering a mix:\nIf I offer 8 Wheat (value 40) + 2 Wood (value 20) = total value 60.\nI could ask for 2 Ore (value 72). This would be a gain of 12 for me.\nThis seems like a reasonable offer. Player 0 should have some Ore to trade.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
