The proposed trade would decrease my total value by 5, which isn't beneficial. Instead, I should either counter-offer or reject this trade to seek a better deal.\n\n3. **Counter-Offer Option**: I could propose a counter-offer where I give fewer Wood for the Sheep, but since Player 1 offered directly, the simplest action is to reject and wait for a better opportunity or initiate a new offer later.\n\n4. **Next Steps**: Since this trade is unfavorable, I will reject it and look for opportunities in the next turn where I can propose a trade that increases my total value.\n\nAnswer:\n[Deny]",
