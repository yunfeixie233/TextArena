Sheep is in the middle but abundant (24).\n\n3. **Trade Strategy**: \n   - Aim to trade low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) or surplus high-abundance resources (Sheep) for high-value resources (Ore, Brick).\n   - Trade in a way that the total value increases (i.e., the value of incoming resources exceeds the value of outgoing resources).\n\n4. **Possible Offers**:\n   - Offer Sheep (13) and Wheat (6) for Ore (34) or Brick (21).\n   - Example: Offer 4 Sheep (4 * 13 = 52) for 3 Brick (3 * 21 = 63). Net gain: 63 - 52 = +11 value.\n   - Another example: Offer 3 Wheat (3 * 6 = 18) and 1 Sheep (1 * 13 = 13) total 31 for 2 Ore (2 * 34 = 68). Net gain: 68 - 31 = +37 value.\n\n5. **Initial Offer**:\n   - Target Ore (highest value) first. Offer Sheep and Wheat since they are abundant and lower in value.\n   - Propose: 4 Sheep (52) and 1 Wheat (6) total 58 -> 2 Ore (68). Net gain: +10 value.\n\n6. **Format**: Use the required [Offer] format succinctly without extra text.\n\nFinal answer:\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",

A single Brick is worth 21, so a trade that gives me 1 Ore (34) and only 19 value away would actually be +15 for me.  \n   A 1-for-1 swap Ore \u2194 Brick is evidently not on the table (they have already rejected equivalent combos), but perhaps a slightly bigger bundle will tilt things.\n\n5. Constructing a fresh offer  \n   I can spare up to ~3 Brick without dipping below 7 (which felt safe in earlier bids).  They have shown willingness to give 6 Wood (valued 66 plus their relative surplus?), so combining Brick and Wood may produce a mutually valuable shake-up.\n\nLet\u2019s try: offer 2 Brick + 4 Sheep (2\u00d721 + 4\u00d713 = 94) in exchange for 6 Wood + 1 Ore (6\u00d711 + 34 = 100).  \nNet shift: I gain 6 value (100 \u2013 94) while they get the Brick/Sheep they\u2019ve shown appetite for.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick, 4 Sheep -> 6 Wood, 1 Ore]",
