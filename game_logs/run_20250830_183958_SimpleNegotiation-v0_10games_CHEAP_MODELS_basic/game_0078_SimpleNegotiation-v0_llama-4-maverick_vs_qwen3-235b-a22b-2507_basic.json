      "response": "### Negotiation Game Analysis\n\n#### Current Resources and Values\n\nTo begin, let's analyze the resources and their associated values that I, Player 0, currently possess:\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Quantity = 19, Value = 5\n- **[Wood]**: Quantity = 23, Value = 11\n- **[Sheep]**: Quantity = 21, Value = 17\n- **[Brick]**: Quantity = 7, Value = 29\n- **[Ore]**: Quantity = 21, Value = 33\n\nThe total value of my current resources can be calculated as follows:\n- Total Value = (19 * 5) + (23 * 11) + (21 * 17) + (7 * 29) + (21 * 33)\n- Total Value = 95 + 253 + 357 + 203 + 693\n- Total Value = 1601\n\n#### Strategy\n\nTo maximize the total value of my resources, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Based on the given values:\n- The most valuable resources are **[Ore]** (Value = 33) and **[Brick]** (Value = 29).\n- The least valuable resources are **[Wheat]** (Value = 5) and **[Wood]** (Value = 11).\n\n#### Initial Offer\n\nConsidering the values, a strategic initial trade would involve offering resources of lower value in exchange for **[Ore]** or **[Brick]**. Since I already have a significant quantity of **[Ore]**, let's focus on acquiring more **[Brick]**.\n\nLet's propose a trade that involves **[Wheat]** and potentially **[Wood]** for **[Brick]**:\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]'\n\nThis translates to: '[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]'.\n\nHowever, to follow the format, the correct representation is:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]' -> Using the special token format, it should be understood as offering 5 Wheat and 2 Wood in exchange for 1 Brick.\n\nLet's adjust our offer to fit the special token format directly:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]'\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]'",

      "response": "Since Player 1 rejected my previous offer and made no new trade offer, I need to analyze the situation and potentially make a new offer.

I previously offered 5 Wheat and 2 Wood for 1 Brick. The total value of the offered resources is (5*5) + (2*11) = 25 + 22 = 47, and the value of the requested resource is 1*29 = 29. Since 47 is greater than 29, the initial offer was not favorable.\n\nLet's adjust the offer. I need to think about what resources I can offer that are less valuable and what I can request that is more valuable or at least a good trade. \n\nOne possible trade could involve offering some Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 11) for a more valuable resource. Since Brick (Value: 29) is relatively valuable and I already have some, let's consider offering less valuable resources for something more valuable or keeping the same value but gaining quantity.\n\nConsidering my resources, I can make a new offer. For instance, I can offer some of my Wheat and Wood for Ore, as Ore is one of the most valuable resources. \n\nLet's calculate: Offering 7 Wheat (7*5 = 35) and 3 Wood (3*11 = 33) totals 68 in value. I can request 2 Ore (2*33 = 66) in return, which is close in value and a reasonable trade.\n\nSo, my new offer is: [Offer: 7 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore]\n\nThe action is: [Offer: 7 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore]",

However, let's assess the value change hypothetically ignoring the quantity issue: Lost \\(5*5 + 2*11 = 25 + 22 = 47\\), Gained \\(4*17 + 1*29 = 68 + 29 = 97\\), Net change: \\(+50\\).\n\nTo make this trade viable, Player 0 needs to have enough Wheat and Wood. Let's consider if adjusting our resources could make a similar trade viable or if we should directly respond to the offer.\n\nGiven the constraint that we cannot have negative resources and considering our goal is to increase the total value, let's directly analyze the offer from Player 1.\n\nSince accepting the offer as is results in a negative quantity of Wheat, it's not directly acceptable. However, we can consider making a counteroffer that is more balanced.\n\n## Step 1: Assess the Current Resources and Value\nWe have: Wheat: 2, Wood: 18, Sheep: 21, Brick: 7, Ore: 22 after the last offer.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate Player 1's Offer\nPlayer 1's offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 5 Wheat, 2 Wood. This cannot be accepted due to insufficient Wheat.\n\n## Step 3: Consider a Counteroffer\nTo make a trade, we should think about what we can offer that is more balanced. One idea is to adjust the quantities to be more feasible.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a Counteroffer\nLet's think about offering fewer resources to match what we have. For instance, we could offer less Wheat and Wood.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on the Action for This Turn\nSince we can't accept the offer directly due to the Wheat quantity, and given that our previous offers were rejected, we need to either make a new offer or deny the current offer.\n\nThe best answer is [Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 4 Sheep, 1 Brick].",

      "response": "Since the current turn is the 10th turn, and I have to make a decision based on the given information, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current state of my resources is:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 19 - (5 + 7 + 5 + 2 + 6) = 19 - 25 = -6 (implying I don't have enough wheat due to previous offers, but for the sake of the game, let's consider the actual quantity before any offer was accepted: 19)\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 23 - (2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1) = 23 - 9 = 14\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 21 \n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 7 \n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 21\n\nLet's correct the understanding of my current resources based on the history given:\n- Initial: Wheat = 19, Wood = 23, Sheep = 21, Brick = 7, Ore = 21\n- Offered: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood; 7 Wheat, 3 Wood; 5 Wheat; 2 Wheat, 2 Wood; 6 Wheat, 1 Wood (total: 25 Wheat, 8 Wood)\n- So, actual remaining: Wheat = 19 - 25 = -6 (theoretically, I shouldn't have made those offers, so let's assume it's still 19 for resource calculation simplicity), Wood = 23 - 8 = 15\n\nThe last offer from Player 1 was: Offered items: 7 Wheat, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 2 Brick\n\nLet's analyze the last offer made by Player 1:\n- They are offering 7 Wheat (Value: 5 * 7 = 35) and 2 Wood (Value: 11 * 2 = 22), totaling 35 + 22 = 57.\n- They are requesting 2 Brick (Value: 29 * 2 = 58).\n\nGiven my current resource state and the values:\n- Accepting this offer means I give away 2 Brick and get 7 Wheat and 2 Wood.\n\nMy current total value = (19 * 5) + (15 * 11) + (21 * 17) + (7 * 29) + (21 * 33) = 95 + 165 + 357 + 203 + 693 = 1513\n\nIf I accept the offer:\n- I lose 2 Brick = 2 * 29 = 58\n- I gain 7 Wheat = 7 * 5 = 35 and 2 Wood = 2 * 11 = 22, so total gain = 35 + 22 = 57\n- Net change = 57 - 58 = -1\n\nSince the net change is negative (-1), it is not beneficial for me to accept this offer.\n\nHowever, I need to respond. Since there's no new information that suggests making a new offer would be beneficial or that I should change my strategy at this late stage (10th turn), and considering that making a new offer is not explicitly required if I don't see a benefit, the most straightforward action based on the given format is to either accept, deny, or make a new offer. \n\nThe last offer from Player 1 is not favorable. I can either deny it or make a counteroffer. Making a counteroffer might not be useful at this stage since it's the last turn.\n\nThe action should be: '[Deny]'.\n\nSo, my response is: '[Deny]'.",
