Player 1 likely saw this imbalance and rejected it.\n\n3. **Revised Strategy**:\n   - Need to offer trades where the **value given is less than the value received**, increasing total value.\n   - Prioritize trading away high-quantity, low-value-per-unit resources (e.g., Wood, Sheep) for low-quantity, high-value-per-unit resources (e.g., Ore, Brick).\n\n4. **New Offer Construction**:\n   - **Offer Sheep (high qty, mid value) and Wood (high qty, low value) for Ore (high value) and Brick (high value)**.\n   - Example: Offer 5 Sheep (75 value) + 5 Wood (40 value) = 115 value.\n   - Request 3 Ore (108 value) + 2 Brick (54 value) = 162 value.\n   - Net gain for Player 0: 162 - 115 = 47 value.\n\n5. **Refined Offer**:\n   - Adjust quantities to make the trade more appealing to Player 1 while still favorable to Player 0.\n   - **Offer: 4 Sheep (60 value) + 6 Wood (48 value) \u2192 3 Ore (108 value) + 2 Brick (54 value)**.\n   - Net gain: (108 + 54) - (60 + 48) = 54 value for Player 0.\n\nFinal answer: [Offer: 4 Sheep, 6 Wood -> 3 Ore, 2 Brick]",

I notice every trade offer so far (even the very small ones) has been rejected, so Player 1 almost certainly also values Ore and Brick extremely highly and is unwilling to give any up.  \nTherefore I should try to acquire Ore/Brick without asking for any Ore or Brick in return.
