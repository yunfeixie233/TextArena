      "response": "Thought process (internal):\n1. I need to calculate the net value change for Player 1 if I accept the latest offer (0 offering 5 Wood, 2 Brick -> 4 Wheat, 2 Ore).\n\n2. Current values per unit:\n- Wheat: 6\n- Wood: 9\n- Sheep: 18\n- Brick: 24\n- Ore: 37\n\n3. Analyzing the offer:\n- **Giving**: 4 Wheat (4*6=24) + 2 Ore (2*37=74) \u2192 Total given value = 24 + 74 = 98\n- **Receiving**: 5 Wood (5*9=45) + 2 Brick (2*24=48) \u2192 Total received value = 45 + 48 = 93\n- Net value change = 93 (received) - 98 (given) = -5 \u2192 This is unfavorable by 5 points.\n\n4. Since this decreases my total resource value by 5, I should reject this offer.\n\n5. Instead, I should propose a counter-offer that increases my net value. Given the current stock and values:\n- I have high Wood (24) and Wheat (24) stock with low values (9 and 6 respectively).\n- Ore is overvalued for me (only 9 left with high 37 value).\n- Sheep is moderately stocked (22) with value 18.\n- Brick is relatively low stock (14) with high value (24).\n\n6. A favorable counter-offer would be to give low-value resources and gain high-value ones. For example:\n- Offer 3 Wood (value 9) and 3 Wheat (value 6) in exchange for 1 Ore (value 37) and 2 Brick (value 24). Net value change would be (37 + 48) - (27 + 18) = 40, but this may be too aggressive.\n\n7. To present a more balanced but still favorable offer:\n- Offer 5 Sheep (5*18=90) and receive 2 Ore (2*37=74) and 2 Brick (2*24=48) \u2192 Net gain of 32, but would give me considerable Ore and Brick which are valuable. However, this might not be accepted by Player 0.\n\n8. A reasonable middle-ground offer:\n- Offer 5 Wheat (30) + 2 Wood (18) in exchange for 2 Brick (48) + 3 Sheep (54) \u2192 This gives me net 108 - 48 = 60 vs my 30+18=48 \u2192 Net gain of 12, giving me more Sheep and Brick.\n\n9. After reconsidering, the most reasonable offer that has a chance of acceptance and is still favorable:\n- Offer 4 Wood (36) + 3 Wheat (18) \u2192 54 value\n- Request 2 Brick (48) + 1 Ore (37) \u2192 85 value\n- Net gain of 31 for me. This might be acceptable to Player 0 as well.\n\n10. However, to ensure acceptance, slightly reduce the request:\n- Final chosen offer: 4 Wood (36) + 3 Wheat (18) \u2192 54 value\n- Request 2 Brick (48) + 1 Ore (37) \u2192 85 value (but this is too favorable).\n\n11. Readjust to a more balanced but still positive offer:\n- Offer 5 Wood (45) + 4 Wheat (24) \u2192 69 value\n- Request 3 Brick (72) + 1 Ore (37) \u2192 109 value (net 40 gain, unlikely).\n\n12. Simplify to reasonable exchange:\n- Offer 3 Wood (27) + 2 Wheat (12) \u2192 39 value\n- Request 1 Brick (24) + 1 Ore (37) \u2192 61 value (net 22 gain).\n\nAction:\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]",
