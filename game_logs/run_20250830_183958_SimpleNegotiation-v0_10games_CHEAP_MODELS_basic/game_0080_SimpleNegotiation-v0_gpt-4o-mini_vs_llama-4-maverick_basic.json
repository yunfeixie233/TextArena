      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the offer made by Player 0.\n\nPlayer 0's offer: `[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]`\n\nLet's decode this offer:\n- Player 0 is offering 3 Sheep and 2 Ore.\n- Player 0 is requesting 5 Brick and 2 Sheep in return.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate what we have and what we would give away or receive:\n\n1. **Sheep**: We have 8 Sheep. The offer involves giving away 2 Sheep (request) and receiving 3 Sheep (offer). The net gain would be 1 Sheep. Value of Sheep = 17. So, net gain = 1 * 17 = 17.\n   \n2. **Ore**: We have 17 Ore. The offer involves giving away 2 Ore (request is actually for us, it's what we give, but in this context, it's what Player 0 is offering, so we receive). The net gain would be 2 Ore. Value of Ore = 39. So, net gain = 2 * 39 = 78.\n\n3. **Brick**: We have 17 Brick. The offer involves receiving 5 Brick (offer). The net gain would be 5 Brick. Value of Brick = 26. So, net gain = 5 * 26 = 130.\n\nLet's calculate the total value change:\n- We give away 5 Brick (value: 5 * 26 = 130) and 2 Sheep (value: 2 * 17 = 34). Total value given away = 130 + 34 = 164.\n- We receive 3 Sheep (value: 3 * 17 = 51) and 2 Ore (value: 2 * 39 = 78). Total value received = 51 + 78 = 129.\n\nThe total value change = Total value received - Total value given away = 129 - 164 = -35.\n\nSince the total value change is negative (-35), accepting this offer would decrease the total value of our resources.\n\nTherefore, the action should be: `[Deny]`. \n\nResponse: `[Deny]`",

The values per unit are: Wheat (5), Wood (12), Sheep (17), Brick (26), Ore (39).\n\n## Step 7: Identify a potential trade\nOne potential trade could involve offering Wheat or Wood (lower value) for Sheep, Brick, or Ore (higher value). Given the current quantities:\n- Offering Wheat or Wood for a higher-value resource could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 8: Formulate a trade offer\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (Value: 5) for Ore (Value: 39), as Ore has a significantly higher value per unit.\nFor example, offering 7 Wheat (total value: 35) for 1 Ore (total value: 39) would be beneficial as it increases the total value.\n\n## Step 9: Create the trade offer in the required format\n[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the current state of resources\nThe resources and associated values I currently have are:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 18   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 5    Value: 12\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 8    Value: 17\n- [Brick]   Qty: 17   Value: 26\n- [Ore]     Qty: 17   Value: 39\n\nAfter the last trade with Player 0, where I offered 5 Wheat and 2 Wood for 3 Sheep:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 18 - 5 = 13\n- [Wood]    Qty: 5 - 2 = 3\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 8 + 3 = 11\n\nSo, the updated quantities are:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 13   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 3    Value: 12\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 11   Value: 17\n- [Brick]   Qty: 17   Value: 26\n- [Ore]     Qty: 17   Value: 39\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the last trade and the current situation\nThe last trade I made was: Offered items: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 3 Sheep. Let's calculate the value change:\n- Offered: (5 Wheat * 5) + (2 Wood * 12) = 25 + 24 = 49\n- Requested: 3 Sheep * 17 = 51\nThe trade was beneficial as 51 > 49.\n\n## Step 3: Assess the current resources and think about the next move\nCurrent total value = (13 * 5) + (3 * 12) + (11 * 17) + (17 * 26) + (17 * 39)\n= 65 + 36 + 187 + 442 + 663\n= 1393\n\n## Step 4: Consider potential trades\nSince Player 0 made no new offer and rejected my last offer of 2 Brick for 2 Ore, I need to think about making a new offer. Let's consider the value of the last rejected offer:\n- Offered: 2 Brick * 26 = 52\n- Requested: 2 Ore * 39 = 78\nThis trade would have been beneficial.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on the next trade offer\nGiven that the last trade was rejected, I will try again with a similar or slightly different offer, or think of a new trade that could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 6: Make a new trade offer\nLet's make a new offer: [Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n- Offered: (1 Brick * 26) + (1 Wood * 12) = 26 + 12 = 38\n- Requested: 1 Ore * 39 = 39\nThis trade is slightly beneficial.\n\nHowever, considering the current quantities and values, let's directly check if we can make a more significant beneficial trade or stick with a variation of the previous offer.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate the trade offer in the required format\nLet's try: [Offer: 2 Brick -> 2 Ore] again or a similar variation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Brick -> 2 Ore]}$",
