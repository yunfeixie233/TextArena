      "response": "Thought process:\n\n1. **Initial Assessment**: \n   - Current resources and values:\n     - Wheat: 7 (6 each) \u2192 Total=42\n     - Wood: 12 (10 each) \u2192 Total=120\n     - Sheep: 5 (13 each) \u2192 Total=65\n     - Brick: 12 (22 each) \u2192 Total=264\n     - Ore: 9 (33 each) \u2192 Total=297\n   - Total current value: 42 + 120 + 65 + 264 + 297 = 788.\n\n2. **Previous Offer Analysis**:\n   - Offered: 4 Wood (4*10=40) + 2 Wheat (2*6=12) = 52 value given.\n   - Requested: 2 Ore (2*33=66) + 2 Brick (2*22=44) = 110 value received.\n   - Net gain: 110 - 52 = +58 value (good trade for Player 0).\n   - Player 1 rejected, likely because the trade is very favorable to Player 0.\n\n3. **Next Steps**:\n   - Need to propose a trade that is more balanced or slightly favorable to Player 1 to encourage acceptance.\n   - Identify which resources Player 1 might value more and which we can spare.\n   - We have excess Wood (12) and Wheat (7), and are relatively low on Ore (9) and Brick (12). Sheep is moderate (5).\n\n4. **New Proposal**:\n   - Offer more Sheep and less Wood/Wheat since Sheep has higher value per unit (13) and we have fewer (5).\n   - Request Brick/Ore as they are most valuable.\n   - Example: Offer 3 Sheep (3*13=39) + 1 Wood (1*10=10) \u2192 Request 2 Ore (66) + 1 Brick (22) = 88. Net gain: 88-49=+39 (more balanced than before).\n\n5. **Refine Proposal**:\n   - Reduce net gain for Player 0 to make it more appealing to Player 1. \n   - Offer 3 Sheep + 2 Wood \u2192 Request 3 Ore: \n     - Given: 3*13 + 2*10 = 39 + 20 = 59.\n     - Requested: 3*33 = 99. Net gain: +40 (still high).\n   - Alternatively, Offer 3 Sheep \u2192 Request 2 Brick (44):\n     - Given: 39, Requested: 44. Net gain: +5 (very fair).\n\n6. **Final Proposal**:\n   - Offer 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick. This is very close to even (39 vs 44), likely acceptable to Player 1. It also benefits us by exchanging Sheep (lower value) for Brick (higher value).\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",
