      "response": "Reviewing the game history and my current resources, I aim to maximize total value through favorable trades. My highest-value resource is Ore (value: 39), so acquiring more Ore remains advantageous. Past accepted trades:  \n- 3 Ore for ~85\u201391 in value (e.g., 3 Sheep + 2 Brick = 85, or 2 Brick + 5 Wood = 91).  \n- Brick is plentiful (Qty: 18, Value: 23), making it ideal for offers.  \n\nI propose trading 4 Brick (value: 4 \u00d7 23 = 92) for 3 Ore (value: 3 \u00d7 39 = 117), ensuring a net gain of 25 while aligning with prior accepted value ranges.
