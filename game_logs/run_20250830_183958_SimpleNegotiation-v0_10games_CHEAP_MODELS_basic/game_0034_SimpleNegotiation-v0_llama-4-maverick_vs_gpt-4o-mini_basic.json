      "response": "### Negotiation Game: Initial Analysis and First Turn Strategy\n\n#### Initial Resources and Values:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 13   Value: 6\n- [Wood]    Qty: 24   Value: 12\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 12   Value: 16\n- [Brick]   Qty: 23   Value: 21\n- [Ore]     Qty: 20   Value: 34\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I need to make strategic trades. Let's analyze the initial setup:\n\n1. **Total Initial Value**: Calculate the total initial value.\n   - Total = (13*6) + (24*12) + (12*16) + (23*21) + (20*34)\n   - Total = 78 + 288 + 192 + 483 + 680 = 1721\n\n2. **Identify Potential Trades**: To maximize value, I should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but more quantity if it sets up a future beneficial trade.\n\n3. **Value per Resource**:\n   - Wheat = 6\n   - Wood = 12\n   - Sheep = 16\n   - Brick = 21\n   - Ore = 34\n\nGiven these values, trading away resources with lower values for those with higher values could be beneficial.\n\n### First Turn Strategy\n\nLet's start by making an offer that could potentially increase my total value or set up for a future beneficial trade.\n\nObserving my resources, I have a significant quantity of Wheat, which is the lowest value resource. Trading Wheat for a higher value resource could be a good start.\n\n#### Offer:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'\n\nThis offer trades 5 Wheat (Value = 5*6 = 30) for 1 Sheep (Value = 16). Although it seems like a loss (since 30 > 16), it's not beneficial. Let's reconsider and think about a more strategic trade.\n\nUpon reevaluation, a more strategic initial trade would involve resources that are more aligned with optimizing my total value.\n\nLet's directly examine a potentially beneficial trade without a straightforward 'lower for higher' value swap, considering the quantities and potential future trades.\n\n### Reconsidered First Turn:\nLet's make a more balanced offer that could be attractive and doesn't directly give away value.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick]'\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n- Giving away: (2*12) + (1*16) = 24 + 16 = 40\n- Receiving: 3*21 = 63\n\nThis trade increases my total value by 23 (63 - 40 = 23).\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick]'",

We need to re-evaluate our resources and consider a trade that will increase our total value.\n\n### Potential Trades\n\nTo increase the total value, we should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but more quantity if it leads to a better future trade.\n\n1. **Identify Overvalued and Undervalued Resources**: Our resources' values per unit are: Wheat (6), Wood (12), Sheep (16), Brick (21), Ore (34). Ore is the most valuable.\n\n2. **Consider a Trade Involving Less Valuable Resources**: We could offer some Wheat or Wood for a more valuable resource if possible.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (the least valuable resource) for Sheep (more valuable than Wheat and Wood).\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nThis is a simplified example.

Let's reassess the situation and make a new offer.\n\nConsidering the current resources and their values, a potential trade could involve offering resources that are less valuable or abundant and requesting something more valuable. \n\nOne potential trade could be offering Wheat (less valuable) and possibly some Wood (moderately valuable but still relatively abundant) for something like Sheep or Ore (more valuable).\n\nLet's examine a possible trade:\n- Offer: 4 Wheat -> Request: 1 Sheep\n\nThis trade involves giving up 4 Wheat (Value: 4*6 = 24) for 1 Sheep (Value: 16). It's not favorable as it decreases the total value.\n\nLet's consider another trade:\n- Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> Request: 1 Sheep\n\nOffered: 3 Wheat (3*6 = 18) and 2 Wood (2*12 = 24), Total value given: 18 + 24 = 42\nRequested: 1 Sheep (1*16 = 16), which is not favorable.\n\nAnother possible trade:\n- Offer: 2 Wheat -> Request: 1 Brick\n\nOffered: 2 Wheat (2*6 = 12)\nRequested: 1 Brick (1*21 = 21), which could be favorable.\n\nLet's formulate the offer: '[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\nThe action for this turn will be: '[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'",
