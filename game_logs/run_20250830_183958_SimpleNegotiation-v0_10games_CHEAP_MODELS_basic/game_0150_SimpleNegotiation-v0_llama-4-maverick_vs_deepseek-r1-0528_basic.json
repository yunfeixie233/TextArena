Given the values, Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, then Sheep, then Wood, and finally Wheat.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n\n1. **Trading Wheat (Value: 6)**: It's the least valuable, so trading it away could be beneficial if we get a resource of higher value.\n2. **Trading Wood (Value: 8)**: Also relatively low in value, so potentially trading it for something more valuable is a good idea.\n\nLet's start by considering a trade that involves getting rid of some Wheat or Wood for more valuable resources.\n\n### Turn 1:\nConsidering the values, we can offer to trade some Wheat or Wood for more valuable resources. Let's start with Wheat since it's the least valuable.\n\n'[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]' is one possibility, but it might not be the most beneficial since Sheep is relatively valuable. Let's aim higher.\n\n'[Offer: 10 Wood, 6 Wheat -> 3 Brick]' could be a potential trade. Here, we're giving away resources worth (10*8) + (6*6) = 80 + 36 = 116 for 3 Brick worth (3*23) = 69. This isn't a good trade.\n\nLet's think about a more balanced trade. We have a lot of Wood, so let's consider if we can trade some for something more valuable.\n\n'[Offer: 10 Wood -> 3 Ore]' would mean giving away (10*8) = 80 for (3*36) = 108.

The value given would be 6 (for Wheat), and the value received would be 2*17 = 34. This was a potentially good trade but was rejected.\n\n## Step 2: Consider an alternative trade\nLet's think about what you have and what might be a good trade. You have a lot of Ore, which is very valuable. Player 1 is offering Sheep and Wood for Ore. While the current offer isn't great, maybe a different ratio could be more appealing.\n\n## Step: Formulate a counteroffer or a new offer\nTo utilize the resources effectively, let's consider offering something that might be more appealing to Player 1 while getting a better deal for yourself.\n\n## Step: Analyze resources for a potential trade\nYou could think about offering less valuable resources for more valuable ones or finding a balance.\n\nLet's directly formulate a response based on the current situation:\n\nGiven that the current offer from Player 1 is not favorable, and considering your resources, a potential counteroffer could involve Ore since Player 1 is interested in it. However, you need to minimize the Ore given.\n\nLet's consider an alternative:\n'[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep]' could be a potential counteroffer, as it still involves Ore but at a different ratio.\n\n## Calculation for the counteroffer:\n- Giving 1 Ore (Value: 36)\n- Receiving 2 Sheep (Value: 2*17 = 34)\n\nThis is still not very favorable as it's almost equal in value.\n\n## Better Counteroffer:\nLet's propose: '[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]'\n\n## Calculation:\n- You give: 2 Wood (2*8 = 16) and 1 Brick (23), Total = 16 + 23 = 39\n- You receive: 1 Ore (36)\n\nThis is not a good trade as you're giving more value than you're receiving.\n\n## Another Option:\n'[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood]'\n\n## Calculation:\n- You give: 1 Sheep (17)\n- You receive: 2 Wood (2*8 = 16)\n\nThis is also not favorable.\n\n## Final Thought:\nLet's analyze again and propose something reasonable.\n\n'[Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]' is not directly calculable without knowing the opponent's Brick quantity, but let's check the value:\n- Giving: 1 Ore (36) + 1 Sheep (17) = 53\n- Receiving: 2 Brick (2*23 = 46)\n\nThis is not a good trade.\n\nLet's directly choose an action:\n\nThe response is: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep]",

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first assess the current state of resources and the history of trades.\n\nInitial resources and values:\n- Wheat: 6, Value: 6\n- Wood: 20, Value: 8\n- Sheep: 15, Value: 17\n- Brick: 21, Value: 23\n- Ore: 20, Value: 36\n\nAfter accepting the trade offer from Player 1 (2 Sheep, 4 Wheat -> 2 Ore):\n- Gave: 2 Sheep, 4 Wheat\n- Received: 2 Ore\n\nNew quantities:\n- Wheat: 6 - 4 = 2\n- Wood: 20 (no change)\n- Sheep: 15 - 2 = 13\n- Brick: 21 (no change)\n- Ore: 20 + 2 = 22\n\nNew total value:\n- Wheat: 2, Value: 2\n- Wood: 20, Value: 8\n- Sheep: 13, Value: 13*17/15 = 14.73 (approx), but we'll keep it as is for simplicity: 13 Sheep is worth less than 15 Sheep.\n- Brick: 21, Value: 23\n- Ore: 22, Value: 36*22/20 = 39.6 (approx)\n\nLet's analyze the last offer made by Player 1: [Offered items: 5 Wood, 4 Wheat -> Requested items: 2 Ore]\n\nCurrent resources:\n- Wheat: 2 (not enough to fulfill the request or match the offer directly)\n- Wood: 20\n- Sheep: 13\n- Brick: 21\n- Ore: 22\n\nOffer details:\n- Offered: 5 Wood, 4 Wheat\n- Requested: 2 Ore\n\nWe don't have enough Wheat to directly accept this offer. Let's see if we can make a similar or better offer.\n\n## Step 1: Evaluate the offer from Player 1.\nThe offer is 5 Wood and 4 Wheat for 2 Ore. We lack 2 Wheat to directly accept.\n\n## Step 2: Assess our current resources and the value of the proposed trade.\nWe have 2 Wheat, so we are short 2 Wheat. We have enough Wood (20 > 5), and we have Ore (22 > 2).\n\n## Step 3: Consider making a counteroffer that we can fulfill.\nSince we're short on Wheat, we could consider offering something else in its place or making a different offer. However, we should directly evaluate if adjusting our resources to match or make a better offer is feasible.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the value of the trade.\nThe requested 2 Ore are worth 2 * (36/20) = 3.6. The offered 5 Wood are worth 5 * (8/20) = 2, and 4 Wheat would be worth 4, totaling 6 in value. This trade seems unfavorable for us since we're giving away more valuable resources (in terms of total value) than we're getting.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on a response or a new offer.\nGiven that we lack Wheat and the trade isn't very favorable, let's directly make a new offer that could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 6: Formulate a new offer based on our current resources and goals.\nLet's directly formulate an offer. We can offer Ore for other resources. Noting that our Ore is valuable, we could offer 1 Ore for a resource that's relatively valuable.\n\nLet's consider: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick] as Brick is relatively valuable.\n\nThe value of 1 Ore is (36/20) = 1.8, and 1 Brick is worth (23/21) = 1.095 (approx). So, this isn't a good trade for us as we're giving more value.\n\n## Step 7: Final decision.\nLet's directly evaluate a potential trade: We have an abundance of Wood and Brick, so let's consider offering some of these for Sheep or other valuable resources.\n\nGiven that Sheep is valuable and we are somewhat low on it after the last trade, let's make an offer to gain Sheep.\n\nLet's make an offer: [Offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Sheep]\n\nThe response format requires us to directly give the action.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Brick -> 5 Sheep]}$",

      "response": "## Step 1\nThe Negotiation Game has begun, and I am Player 0. The game's goal is to trade resources to increase the total value of my resources. I will analyze the initial resources and their values:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 6    Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 20   Value: 8\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 15   Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 21   Value: 23\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 20   Value: 36\n\n## Step 2\nThe game has already seen several turns. I will review the previous actions to understand the negotiation flow and the opponent's preferences:\n1. I offered 6 Wheat for 2 Sheep, which was rejected.\n2. Player 1 offered 1 Sheep and 1 Wood for 1 Ore, which I rejected.\n3. I offered 1 Ore for 2 Sheep, which was rejected.\n4. Player 1 offered 2 Sheep and 4 Wheat for 2 Ore, which I accepted.\n5. I repeated Player 1's last offer (2 Sheep, 4 Wheat for 2 Ore), which was rejected.\n6. Player 1 made no new offer.\n7. I offered 2 Wheat and 2 Wood for 1 Brick, which was rejected.\n8. Player 1 offered 5 Wood and 4 Wheat for 2 Ore, which I rejected.\n9. I repeated Player 1's last offer (5 Wood, 4 Wheat for 2 Ore), which was rejected.\n\n## Step 3\nAfter accepting the trade offer from Player 1 (2 Sheep, 4 Wheat for 2 Ore), my resources changed:\n- Gained: 2 Sheep, 4 Wheat\n- Lost: 2 Ore\nNew quantities:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 6 - 4 + 4 = 6    Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 20   Value: 8\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 15 + 2 = 17   Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 21   Value: 23\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 20 - 2 = 18   Value: 36\n\n## Step 4\nGiven the current state and the history of negotiations, I need to decide on the next action. My current resources are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 6    Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 20   Value: 8\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 17   Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 21   Value: 23\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 18   Value: 36\n\n## Step 5\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I should consider trading resources of lower value for those of higher value. Ore has the highest value, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat. I have already made several offers, and some were rejected. I need to come up with a new trade offer that could be attractive to Player 1.\n\n## Step 6\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- I could offer Wheat or Wood (lower value) for Sheep, Brick, or Ore (higher value).\n- Since Ore is very valuable and I have a significant amount, I should be cautious about giving it away.\n\n## Step 7\nConsidering the values and the previous rejections, a potential trade could involve offering some of my Wood (which is relatively abundant and less valuable) for Brick or Ore. However, I need to be mindful of the quantities and the fact that some of my previous offers were rejected.\n\n## Step 8\nGiven that Player 1 previously offered 2 Sheep and 4 Wheat for 2 Ore and I accepted, and later they rejected my repeat of their offer, it suggests they might be looking for something else or were not satisfied with repeating the trade. I will consider making a new offer that involves resources I have in abundance or those that are not crucial for me.\n\n## Step 9\nOne potential offer is to trade some of my Wood for Brick since Brick is more valuable than Wood. For instance, offering 5 Wood for 2 Brick could be a starting point, as it gives Player 1 a significant amount of Wood while costing me relatively less valuable resources compared to what I might gain.\n\n## Step 10\nLet's formulate the offer: '[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Brick]'.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Brick]}$",
