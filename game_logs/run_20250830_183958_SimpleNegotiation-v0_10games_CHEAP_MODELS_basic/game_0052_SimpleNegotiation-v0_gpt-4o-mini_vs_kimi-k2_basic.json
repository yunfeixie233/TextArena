However, the amount of resources you'd be left with is not advantageous given the value of the remaining resources you\u2019d have.\n  \n2. **Player 1's Other Offer**: 3 Ore, 7 Brick -> 8 Sheep, 2 Wood\n   - This trade is not favorable as you would lose brick, which you have in surplus and gain sheep.\n\n### New Trade Proposal:\nConsidering the situation and the responses you've received, a new offer could focus on trading your surplus resources without losing valuable ones. \n\nI suggest making a new offer to Player 1.\n\n#### New Offer:\n- **Offered items**: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood \n- **Requested items**: 4 Brick, 3 Ore\n\nFormat:\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 4 Brick, 3 Ore]`\n\nThis offer seeks to exchange excess materials (Wheat and Wood) for valuable Brick and Ore which may help in bolstering your resource pool.
