      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to assess the current values and determine the best course of action.

I have 14 Wheat.\n\nFor Turn 1, I'll make an offer to trade Wheat for a resource that could potentially increase my total value. Given that Ore and Brick are high-value resources, I'll try to get more of either or both if possible.\n\nI'll make an offer: `[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis offer trades 7 Wheat (value = 42) for 1 Ore (value = 35). While it seems like a potential loss, the difference isn't significant, and getting more Ore could be beneficial in future trades or maintaining my current high-value resource quantity.\n\nLet's calculate the value change:\n- Giving away 7 Wheat = 7 * 6 = 42\n- Getting 1 Ore = 1 * 35 = 35\n\nThe immediate effect is a loss of 7 value units.

      "response": "Let's analyze the game state and history.\n\nCurrent resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 9   Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 7    Value: 12\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 7    Value: 12\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 18   Value: 30\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 12   Value: 35\n\nThe game history shows that we've been trying to trade Wheat for Ore, but the previous offers were either rejected or not reciprocated with a counteroffer. Noting the consistent rejection of our offers and Player 1's initial offer of 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, which we accepted, it seems like the negotiation is centered around this trade.\n\nTo maximize the total value of resources, we should continue to try to get Ore for Wheat since Ore has a higher value (35) compared to Wheat (6). However, we need to adjust our offer to be more appealing to Player 1.\n\nLet's make a new offer. We have 9 Wheat left, and we are willing to trade some of it for Ore. Considering the previous rejection of our offers of 7 Wheat, 6 Wheat, 4 Wheat, and 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, we should consider making an offer that is at least as favorable as the one Player 1 initially made (5 Wheat for 1 Ore).\n\nHere is a potential new offer:\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis is a more aggressive offer in terms of the exchange rate but still attempts to get more Ore. \n\nResponse: [Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
