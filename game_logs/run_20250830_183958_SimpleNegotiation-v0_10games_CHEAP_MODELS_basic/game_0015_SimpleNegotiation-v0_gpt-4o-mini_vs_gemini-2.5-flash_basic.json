      "response": "Let's evaluate the current resource situation after the trades that occurred:\n\n### Current Resources After Trades:\n1. Wheat: 25 - 5 + 4 = **24** (5 Wheat given to Player 1, 4 Wheat received from Player 1)\n2. Wood: 11 - 4 = **7** (4 Wood given to Player 1)\n3. Sheep: 14 - 0 = **14** (No sheep traded)\n4. Brick: 0 + 1 = **1** (1 Brick received from Player 1)\n5. Ore: 18 - 2 + 1 = **17** (2 Ore given to Player 1, 1 Ore received from Player 1)\n\n### Summary of Current Resources:\n- Wheat: 24 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 7 (Value: 8)\n- Sheep: 14 (Value: 13)\n- Brick: 1 (Value: 25)\n- Ore: 17 (Value: 32)\n\n### Total Value Calculation:\n- Total Value = (24 * 6) + (7 * 8) + (14 * 13) + (1 * 25) + (17 * 32)\n- Total Value = 144 + 56 + 182 + 25 + 544 = **951**\n\n### Analyzing the New Trade Offer from Player 1:\nPlayer 1's offer is:\n- Offered items: **10 Wheat** \n- Requested items: **2 Ore**\n\nTraded Value:\n- 10 Wheat * 6 = 60\n- 2 Ore * 32 = 64\n\n### Decision:\nConsidering I currently have 24 Wheat and 17 Ore, trading 10 Wheat for 2 Ore is a beneficial trade since:\n1. Wheat's value is less than Ore's.\n2. I would still retain plenty of Wheat even after the trade.\n\n### Response to Player 1's Offer:\nI will **accept** Player 1's offer.\n\n### Action:\n[Accept]",
