We should look to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values if possible.\n\n- We have successfully traded for Ore (high value) previously. Continuing this strategy could be beneficial.\n- Let's analyze the resources we have and their values:\n  - We have a good amount of Ore now (Qty: 20). Trading some Ore for other resources might not be beneficial unless we get a very good deal.\n  - We have relatively lower quantities of Wheat and moderate quantities of Wood.\n\n### Step 5: Formulate a Trade Offer\n\nConsidering the values:\n- Ore (Value: 32) is one of the highest value resources we have.\n- Brick (Value: 25) is also of high value.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some of our lower-value resources or even higher-value resources if the quantity requested is reasonable.\n\nLet's formulate an offer:\n- We could offer some Wheat (low value) and possibly some Wood (moderate value) for a resource that is of higher value or at least equivalent.\n\nExample Offer:\n- '[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]' is not beneficial as we already have Ore.\n- '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Brick]' could be considered. We have Sheep and Wheat, and Brick is of high value.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the proposed trade:\n- Offering: 3 Sheep (3*15 = 45) + 2 Wheat (2*5 = 10) = 55 total value\n- Requesting: 2 Brick (2*25 = 50) \n- This trade is not beneficial as we're offering more value than we're getting.\n\nLet's consider another option:\n- '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]':\n  - Offering: 4 Wheat (4*5 = 20)\n  - Requesting: 1 Brick (1*25 = 25)\n- This trade is beneficial as we're getting more value than we're offering.\n\n### Step 6: Make the Trade Offer\n\nGiven the analysis, let's make a trade offer:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\n### Output\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'",
