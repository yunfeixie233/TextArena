Ore is my highest-value resource per card, and I still have far less Ore than any other (just 9).  \n   So more Ore is a high priority.\n\n4. My current stocks:  \n   Brick 19 (plenty)  \n   Wood 7 (medium)  \n   Wheat 5 (low, not desperate)  \n   Sheep 12 (medium\u2013high)  \n\n5. Marginal gain: giving 2 Brick is only worth 2\u00b721 = 42; receiving 1 Ore (+34) nets \u20138, so taking a Sheep or Wood in addition guarantees profit:  \n   34 + 14 \u2013 42 = +6 if I get 1 Sheep; or  \n   34 + 12 \u2013 42 = +4 if I get 1 Wood.  \n\n6. Therefore, offering 2 Brick for 1 Ore plus 1 other useful card is value-increasing.  \n   I will offer 2 Brick and ask for 1 Ore + 1 Wood (slightly less desperate ask than Sheep).\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood]",
