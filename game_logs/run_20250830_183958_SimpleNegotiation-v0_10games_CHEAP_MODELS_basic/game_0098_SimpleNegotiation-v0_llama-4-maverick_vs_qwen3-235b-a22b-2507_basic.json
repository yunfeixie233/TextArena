      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, I will analyze the current state of my resources and determine the best course of action to increase their total value.\n\n#### Current Resources and Values\n\n- Wheat: Qty: 18, Value: 6\n- Wood: Qty: 20, Value: 10\n- Sheep: Qty: 15, Value: 16\n- Brick: Qty: 14, Value: 28\n- Ore: Qty: 14, Value: 34\n\n#### Total Current Value\n\nTo understand the current total value, we calculate:\n- Wheat: 18 * 6 = 108\n- Wood: 20 * 10 = 200\n- Sheep: 15 * 16 = 240\n- Brick: 14 * 28 = 392\n- Ore: 14 * 34 = 476\n- Total Value = 108 + 200 + 240 + 392 + 476 = 1416\n\n#### Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I need to strategically decide which resources to trade and what to request in return. The resources with the highest values per unit are Ore (34) and Brick (28), indicating that holding or acquiring more of these could be beneficial. Conversely, Wheat has the lowest value per unit (6), making it a potential candidate for trade if I can get something more valuable in return.\n\n#### Initial Offer\n\nSince Wood has a relatively lower value compared to other resources like Ore and Brick, and Sheep is moderately valued, I will consider making an initial offer that involves trading some of my less valuable resources for more valuable ones. However, I need to be cautious and consider what my opponent might be willing to accept or offer.\n\nLet's make an initial offer that involves trading some Wheat (the lowest value resource) for a resource that is more valuable. Since Ore is the most valuable, let's try to get more Ore.\n\n### Offer\n\nI'll make an offer to trade 5 Wheat (which has a total value of 30) for 1 Ore (valued at 34), which would be a gain in total value.\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`",
