      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, I will analyze the current state of my resources to determine the best course of action for maximizing their total value.\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n\n1. **Wheat**: Qty: 22, Value: 6\n2. **Wood**: Qty: 15, Value: 11\n3. **Sheep**: Qty: 8, Value: 13\n4. **Brick**: Qty: 21, Value: 24\n5. **Ore**: Qty: 15, Value: 33\n\n#### Initial Total Value:\nTo understand the starting point, we calculate the total initial value of the resources.\n\n- Total Value = (22 * 6) + (15 * 11) + (8 * 13) + (21 * 24) + (15 * 33)\n- Total Value = 132 + 165 + 104 + 504 + 495\n- Total Value = 1400\n\n#### Strategy:\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources through trades. To achieve this, we need to identify which resources are more valuable and try to acquire more of the higher-value resources while possibly trading away lower-value ones.\n\n#### Observations:\n- **Ore** is the most valuable resource (Value: 33), followed by **Brick** (Value: 24).\n- **Wheat** is the least valuable resource (Value: 6).\n\n#### Trade Strategy for Turn 1:\nTo initiate a trade, we should consider what we can offer that is not as valuable and what we can request that is more valuable or at least beneficial.\n\nGiven the current quantities and values, a reasonable initial strategy could involve trying to trade some of the less valuable resources for more valuable ones or maintaining a balance while gaining value.\n\nLet's consider offering some **Wheat** (less valuable) and see if we can get a more valuable resource.\n\n### Turn 1 Action:\nSince we have a significant amount of **Wheat** and it's the least valuable, we can start by offering some **Wheat** in exchange for a more valuable resource.\n\nFor example, let's offer 10 **Wheat** for 1 **Ore** (since **Ore** is very valuable, asking for 1 is a reasonable starting point).\n\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n\nLet's see how the opponent responds.",

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the current situation and resources.\n\n### Current Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: 22 units, Value: 6 per unit\n- Wood: 15 units, Value: 11 per unit\n- Sheep: 8 units, Value: 13 per unit\n- Brick: 21 units (previously offered 5, so remaining is 16 units), Value: 24 per unit\n- Ore: 15 units (previously offered 0, but had 15; let's check the previous offer again for Ore), Value: 33 per unit\n\nLet's review the previous offers and the current state more precisely:\n1. Initially offered 10 Wheat for 1 Ore. This was rejected. So, Wheat: 22 - 10 = 12, and Ore: 15 (since the offer was rejected, quantities remain the same).\n2. Then offered 5 Brick for 10 Wood. This was also rejected. So, Brick: 21 - 5 = 16, and other quantities remain unchanged.\n\nThus, after the rejections and considering the initial quantities:\n- Wheat: 12 units\n- Wood: 15 units\n- Sheep: 8 units\n- Brick: 16 units\n- Ore: 15 units\n\n### Evaluation:\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources. Let's examine potential trades that could be beneficial.\n\n1. **Current Total Value:**\n   - Wheat: 12 * 6 = 72\n   - Wood: 15 * 11 = 165\n   - Sheep: 8 * 13 = 104\n   - Brick: 16 * 24 = 384\n   - Ore: 15 * 33 = 495\n   - Total Value = 72 + 165 + 104 + 384 + 495 = 1220\n\n2. **Potential Trades:**\n   To increase the total value, we should look to acquire resources with higher value per unit or increase the quantity of resources that are already valuable.\n\nLet's directly inspect the last offer made and the resources we have:\n- We previously offered 5 Brick (Value: 24 per unit) for 10 Wood (Value: 11 per unit). The offer was rejected. Let's re-evaluate this kind of trade or similar ones.\n\n### New Offer Consideration:\nSince Brick has a higher value than Wood, trading Brick for Wood isn't beneficial unless we get a very favorable ratio. Let's think about other potential trades.\n\n1. **Trading Sheep or Wheat for Ore:** Since Ore is very valuable, giving away less valuable resources for it could be a good trade.\n   - Offering Sheep (Value: 13) for Ore (Value: 33) could be a good idea. For example, '[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nLet's consider making a new offer:\n- We could offer '[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' because 3 Sheep = 3 * 13 = 39, and 1 Ore = 33. This isn't a good trade for us. We need to think of a trade where we get more value.\n\n### Decision:\nLet's directly propose a potentially beneficial trade.\n\nSince the last turn involved rejecting an offer and our previous offers being rejected, let's directly inspect a trade involving resources with high value differences.\n\n- An example could be: '[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' \n   - We're giving away: 4 Wheat * 6 + 2 Sheep * 13 = 24 + 26 = 50\n   - We're getting: 1 Ore * 33 = 33\n   - This is not a good trade as we're losing value.\n\nLet's directly form a trade: We have plenty of Brick and Wheat, and not so many Sheep. Acquiring more Ore or keeping the resources balanced is key.\n\n### A Potential Trade:\nLet's think about giving away Wheat (low value) for something more valuable or maintaining our current resources and looking for a good trade.\n\nUpon reflection, a reasonable trade could involve:\n- '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis involves giving away less valuable resources for a more valuable one.\n\n### Action:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' \n\nThis is a calculated trade aiming to increase or optimize the resource value. \n\nLet's format this according to the required action format:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'",

Offered 10 Wheat for 1 Ore. Rejected.\n2. Offered 5 Brick for 10 Wood. Rejected.\n3. Offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore. Rejected.\n\nIt seems that my previous offers were not successful. Let's re-evaluate and consider a different strategy.\n\nTo increase the total value, I should aim to acquire resources with higher values or quantities that are more valuable. \n\nNoting that Ore (Value: 33) and Brick (Value: 24) are among the highest value resources I currently possess, it might be beneficial to try to acquire more of these or maintain the current amount.\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- I have Wheat (Value: 6), which is relatively low in value. Trading it for other resources could be beneficial if I get something of higher total value.\n- I have Wood (Value: 11), which is also relatively lower in value compared to Ore and Brick.\n\nConsidering my resources and the goal to increase total value, let's attempt to make another trade.\n\nSince the last offer (2 Sheep for 1 Ore) was rejected, and given that Ore is very valuable, let's try to offer something potentially more attractive for 1 Ore. \n\nSheep is valued at 13, so offering more Sheep or a different combination that includes lower-value resources might be considered.\n\nLet's make a new offer: \n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer includes 4 Wheat (total value = 4 * 6 = 24) and 1 Sheep (value = 13), totaling 37 in value, in exchange for 1 Ore (value = 33). This is a slight increase in total value for me if accepted, as I'm gaining 33 value for resources worth 37, which isn't beneficial. Let's reconsider.\n\nReconsidering, an alternative could be to directly offer a resource for Ore or another valuable resource.\n\nLet's directly offer a more straightforward trade.\n\nSince my last few offers were rejected, I'll try to think of a more strategic offer.\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]\n\nThis involves offering 3 Brick (3 * 24 = 72) for 2 Ore (2 * 33 = 66). While this isn't a good trade for me value-wise, let's adjust our strategy.\n\nLet's try a different combination that's more favorable.\n\nAlternatively, let's directly think about acquiring more of the higher-value resources or maintaining what I have.\n\nLet's make a more reasonable offer that could potentially be accepted and benefits me slightly or is at least fair.\n\nUpon re-evaluation, an offer that could be considered reasonable and was not directly tried yet could involve trading lower-value resources for a higher-value one or maintaining a balance.\n\nLet's directly analyze the potential of making an offer for Wood since it is relatively valuable and I previously tried to acquire it.\n\nHowever, my previous offer for Wood was rejected.\n\nGiven the rejections, I need to either come up with a better offer or wait for an incoming offer.\n\nLet's wait for the next turn to see if Player 1 makes an offer.\n\nFor now, I'll choose not to make a new offer and observe.\n\nSince there's no new offer from Player 1, and I don't have a new offer ready:\nNo new action is taken at this moment.\n\nLet's wait and observe the next turn.\n\nHowever, as per the game format, I should provide an action.\n\n[Deny] is the default for an incoming offer, but there's no incoming offer.\n\nLet's consider a potential offer again.\n\nUpon further consideration, let's directly make a simpler offer.\n\nLet's try:\n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 4 Brick]\n\nThis involves giving away 10 Wood (10 * 11 = 110) for 4 Brick (4 * 24 = 96), which is not beneficial. So, let's not do this.\n\nLet's directly think about the best action.\n\nSince I don't have a solid new offer and no offer is incoming, the most straightforward action is to:\n[Deny]\n\nThis is more of a placeholder as there's no offer to deny.

Let's consider making a counteroffer or negotiating a better deal.\n\nBefore making a new offer, let's examine our previous offers:\n\t- We offered 10 Wheat for 1 Ore ( rejected )\n\t- We offered 5 Brick for 10 Wood ( rejected )\n\t- We offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore ( rejected )\n\t- We offered 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep for 1 Ore ( rejected )\n\t- We offered 4 Wood for 2 Ore ( rejected )\n\nWe can try to adjust our previous offers or make a new one. One possible counteroffer could be:\n\t+ Offered items: 4 Wood, 1 Brick -> Requested items: 2 Ore\n\nThis counteroffer reduces the quantity of Wood and adds 1 Brick to make the deal more appealing to Player 1.\n\nLet's make this counteroffer:\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 1 Brick -> 2 Ore]\n\nSo, the response is: [Offer: 4 Wood, 1 Brick -> 2 Ore]",
