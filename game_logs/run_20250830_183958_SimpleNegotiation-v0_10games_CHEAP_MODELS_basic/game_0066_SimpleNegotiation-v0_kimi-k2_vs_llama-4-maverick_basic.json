      "response": "To make the next move, let's first evaluate the current state of resources and the previous trades.\n\nInitially, I had:\n- Wheat: 24 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 11 (Value: 8)\n- Sheep: 21 (Value: 18)\n- Brick: 10 (Value: 24)\n- Ore: 22 (Value: 38)\n\nAfter the trades:\n1. I offered 2 Ore -> Received 4 Sheep\n   - Ore: 22 - 2 = 20\n   - Sheep: 21 + 4 = 25\n\n2. I offered 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> Received 1 Ore\n   - Wheat: 24 - 5 = 19\n   - Wood: 11 - 2 = 9\n   - Ore: 20 + 1 = 21\n\nCurrent state:\n- Wheat: 19\n- Wood: 9\n- Sheep: 25\n- Brick: 10\n- Ore: 21\n\nLet's calculate the total value:\n- Wheat: 19 * 6 = 114\n- Wood: 9 * 8 = 72\n- Sheep: 25 * 18 = 450\n- Brick: 10 * 24 = 240\n- Ore: 21 * 38 = 798\nTotal value = 114 + 72 + 450 + 240 + 798 = 1674\n\nNow, let's consider making a new trade offer. The goal is to increase the total value.\n\nSince Ore has the highest value and I already have a significant amount of it, I should be cautious about giving away too much Ore. However, I can consider trades that might increase my Ore or other high-value items.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some Wheat (lower value) or Wood (moderate value) for Brick (higher value) or Ore (highest value). Let's consider a trade that could be beneficial.\n\nGiven my current resources and the need to increase the total value, I'll think about offering some of my less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nLet's make an offer: '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'.\n\nThe reasoning is:\n- I have 19 Wheat, and giving away 4 will still leave me with 15 Wheat (15 * 6 = 90). The value change for Wheat is 4 * 6 = 24.\n- I will receive 1 Brick, which is worth 1 * 24 = 24.\n\nThis trade doesn't change the total value much since I'm essentially swapping value-equivalent resources, but it doesn't directly decrease my total value either.\n\nHowever, considering the values and my goal to increase the total value, a more strategic move might be to look for opportunities to gain Ore or maintain my current high-value resources.\n\nLet's directly assess the feasibility of the proposed trade and directly adjust:\n'[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThe calculation:\n- Giving away 3 Wood (3 * 8 = 24) and 2 Wheat (2 * 6 = 12) totals to 36.\n- Receiving 1 Ore (1 * 38 = 38).\n\nThis trade slightly increases my total value (gain of 2).\n\nThus, my next action is: [Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore].",
