      "response": "After reviewing our conversation so far, it looks like most of our offers have been rejected because they either asked for too much on my side or gave up high-value Ore without much in return.  \n\nCurrent standing:\n- I have 18 Ore, valued at 35 each\u2014my biggest asset.  \n- I also have plenty of Brick and Sheep (22 Brick @ 21 each, 24 Sheep @ 14 each).  \n- My opponent clearly treasures Ore too and has rejected every offer that involved moving Ore from me.\n\nTo make a deal attractive, I need to:\n1. Avoid asking for any Ore in return.  \n2. Give up lower-value excess while receiving something I truly need (and have fewer of) that still keeps the total value of my holdings from dropping.\n\nRight now Wood is scarce for me (only 11 vs 24 Sheep, 22 Brick). Each Wood is worth 12, so moving up toward ~13-15 Wood would add net value and could be desirable. Since my opponent hasn\u2019t tipped their hand about which exact resources they want or have in abundance, a balanced 2-for-1 style offer seems safest.\n\nTherefore I will propose:  \n[Offer: 6 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 4 Wood]",
