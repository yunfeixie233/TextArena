My goal in the last few turns is to keep improving net value.  \nTo me Ore is worth 36, Brick 24; to Player 0 they seem to treat them cheaply.  \nSheep/wood are comparatively low value to me.\n\nIf I can turn another bundle of sheep into even a single unit of Brick or Ore I come out ahead.\n\nPlayer 0 hasn\u2019t put up any new offer this round, so it\u2019s again my turn to initiate; it\u2019s the 7th potential offer slot of 10.  The maximum number they will usually accept with Ore is about 3\u20134 units for roughly 6\u20138 of mine; with Brick it\u2019s usually 2\u20133 for about 4\u20136.  Giving them 3 extra cards for 1 of mine if it\u2019s Ore/Brick is still value-positive.  To max the chance of closing a deal and adding value I will make the smallest ask they are likely to say yes to.\n\nI currently have 11 Sheep left \u2013 they clearly value sheep highly (previous offer wanted 6 sheep for 1-2 bricks/ore, and he accepted our 6-for-3 offer).  I\u2019ll offer a slightly softer ask:\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",

Although it may help balance my resources, I need to make sure that this trade aligns with the ultimate goal of increasing the overall value.\n\nCalculating the value:\n- The value of 4 Sheep = 4 * 12 = 48\n- The value of 1 Ore = 32\n- The value of 1 Brick = 20\n\nTherefore, gaining 1 Ore and 1 Brick has a total value of 52, while giving away 4 Sheep has a value of 48. This means that the value of resources I receive may outweigh the value of the resources I give away.\n\nSince the increase in value is not significant, I will take a cautious approach and deny the trade.\n\nMy response will be: \n'[Deny]'",
