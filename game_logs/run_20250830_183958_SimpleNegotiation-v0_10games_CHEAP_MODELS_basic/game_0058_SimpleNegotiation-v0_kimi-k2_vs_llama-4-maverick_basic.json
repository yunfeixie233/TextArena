Currently, Wheat is the least valuable resource per unit, and Ore is one of the most valuable.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a new trade offer.\nSince Wheat is less valuable and I have a considerable amount, I can try to trade some Wheat for more valuable resources.

This indicates that the opponent might be looking for Wheat or Wood. Let's formulate a trade that involves these resources.\n\n## Step 6: Prepare a new trade offer.\nLet's consider offering Wheat for Brick since Brick is more valuable than Wheat.
