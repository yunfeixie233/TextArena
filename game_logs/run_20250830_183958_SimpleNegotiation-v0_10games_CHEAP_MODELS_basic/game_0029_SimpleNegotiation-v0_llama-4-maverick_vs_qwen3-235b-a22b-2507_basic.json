      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to analyze the current resources I have and their values, and then decide on the best course of action for trading.\n\nInitially, I have:\n- Wheat: 16 units, Value: 5\n- Wood: 11 units, Value: 12\n- Sheep: 23 units, Value: 17\n- Brick: 22 units, Value: 21\n- Ore: 19 units, Value: 40\n\nLet's calculate the total value of my current resources:\n- Wheat: 16 * 5 = 80\n- Wood: 11 * 12 = 132\n- Sheep: 23 * 17 = 391\n- Brick: 22 * 21 = 462\n- Ore: 19 * 40 = 760\n\nTotal value = 80 + 132 + 391 + 462 + 760 = 1825\n\nTo increase the total value, I should look for opportunities to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but more quantity if it leads to a future gain.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the potential trades:\n1. Trading Wheat (Value: 5) for other resources is not beneficial unless the offered resource is very undervalued.\n2. Trading Wood (Value: 12) for higher-value resources could be beneficial.\n3. Sheep (Value: 17) and Brick (Value: 21) are relatively valuable; trading them for Ore (Value: 40) or more of themselves could be beneficial.\n4. Ore is the most valuable resource; I'd want to acquire more of it.\n\nLet's start with an offer that could potentially increase my total value. Since Ore is the most valuable resource, I'll try to get more of it. \n\n'[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore]'\n\nThis offer gives away 5 Brick (5 * 21 = 105) for 2 Ore (2 * 40 = 80), which doesn't seem immediately beneficial due to the loss in value. Let's reconsider and think about a more balanced or beneficial trade.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 3 Ore]' is not a good trade because 2 Sheep (2 * 17 = 34) + 1 Brick (1 * 21 = 21) = 55 is being offered for 3 Ore (3 * 40 = 120), which is a gain. However, it's still a relatively close value.\n\nLet's make a more appealing initial offer:\n'[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis offer gives away (2 * 12) + 17 = 24 + 17 = 41 for 1 Ore worth 40, which is almost equal and might be acceptable to the other player if they're looking to balance their resources.\n\nMy action for Turn 1:\n'[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'",

Given that Ore is highly valued (40), and I offered 5 Brick (Value: 21 each) for 2 Ore, the total value I offered was 105 for something worth 80. This might have been too costly for Player1.\n\nTo make a more attractive offer or to counter with a different proposal, I should consider what would be beneficial for both parties. Since my goal is to increase the total value of my resources, I need to think about what I can gain that is valuable.\n\nLet's consider making a new offer that still involves Ore, as it's one of the most valuable resources, but perhaps at a different ratio or involving different resources.\n\nBefore making a new offer, I'll examine potential trades:\n- I have a lot of Sheep and Brick, which are valuable, but not as much as Ore.\n- Offering some Sheep or Wood for Ore could be a good start, as these are less valuable than Brick, but still worth something.\n\nLet's make a new offer that involves something other than Brick for Ore:\n[Offer:4 Sheep ->1 Ore]\n\nThis offer is more conservative in terms of the value exchanged. Sheep are valued at 17, so 4 Sheep equal 68, and 1 Ore is 40. This is still a relatively costly trade for the other player but is more balanced in terms of value.\n\nMy action for this turn will be:\n[Offer:4 Sheep ->1 Ore]\n\nLet's see how Player1 responds.",

We have 15 Wheat, 11 Wood, 23 Sheep, 18 Brick, and 22 Ore.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Value**: Let's calculate the total value of our resources.\n   - Total Value = (15 * 5) + (11 * 12) + (23 * 17) + (18 * 21) + (22 * 40)\n   - Total Value = 75 + 132 + 391 + 378 + 880 = 1856\n\n3. **Consider Previous Trades and Outcomes**: We previously offered Brick for Ore, and it was rejected multiple times until we accepted an offer from Player 1 that gave us 3 Ore in exchange for 4 Brick and 1 Wheat. The previous rejections indicate that our initial offers were not favorable to Player 1.\n\n4. **Formulate a New Trade Offer**: We need to think about what we can offer that might be more appealing to Player 1. Since Ore is highly valued and we have it, we should consider if we can make a trade involving Ore that benefits both parties.\n\n5. **Potential Trades**: Given the values, trading Ore for other resources could be beneficial if we get a good deal. We should look for resources that are undervalued or those we are lacking.\n\n6. **Decision Making**: Let's analyze potential trades:\n   - We have a good amount of Ore (22), and its value is high (40). Trading some Ore for other resources could be beneficial if the terms are right.\n   - Player 1 was willing to give 3 Ore for 4 Brick and 1 Wheat. This indicates they value Brick and possibly Wheat.\n\n7. **New Offer**: Considering our resources and the previous successful trade, we could think about offering Ore for other valuable resources. However, we need to be cautious not to give away too much value.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nLet's consider offering 2 Ore for something valuable. Since Player 1 was willing to trade 3 Ore for 4 Brick and 1 Wheat, they might be interested in more Brick or possibly other resources.\n\nGiven our current quantities and the fact that we want to increase our total value, let's propose a trade that might be appealing:\n\n`[Offer: 2 Ore -> 1 Wood, 2 Sheep]`\n\nThis offer gives us some Wood and Sheep, which we already have in considerable quantities, but it reduces our Ore quantity. Let's check the potential value change:\n- We give away 2 Ore = 2 * 40 = 80\n- We gain 1 Wood = 1 * 12 = 12 and 2 Sheep = 2 * 17 = 34\n- Total gain value = 12 + 34 = 46\n- Net change = 46 - 80 = -34\n\nThis trade doesn't seem beneficial as it reduces our total value.\n\nLet's think of another trade:\n\n`[Offer: 1 Ore, 2 Brick -> 3 Wood]`\n\n- We give away 1 Ore = 1 * 40 = 40 and 2 Brick = 2 * 21 = 42\n- Total given away = 40 + 42 = 82\n- We gain 3 Wood = 3 * 12 = 36\n- Net change = 36 - 82 = -46\n\nThis is also not beneficial.\n\nLet's consider our previous successful trade and think about something similar or a slight variation.\n\n### New Trade Offer\n\nAfter reevaluation, let's directly propose a potentially beneficial trade:\n\n`[Offer: 2 Ore -> 5 Sheep]`\n\nLet's check the value:\n- We give away 2 Ore = 80\n- We gain 5 Sheep = 5 * 17 = 85\n- Net change = 85 - 80 = +5\n\nThis trade slightly increases our total value.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 2 Ore -> 5 Sheep]`",
