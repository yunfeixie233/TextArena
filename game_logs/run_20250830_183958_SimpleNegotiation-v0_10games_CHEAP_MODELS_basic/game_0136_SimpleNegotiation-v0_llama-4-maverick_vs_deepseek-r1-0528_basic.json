      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to understand the current total value and then decide on the optimal trades. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of my current resources:\n- Wheat: 18 * 6 = 108\n- Wood: 7 * 10 = 70\n- Sheep: 15 * 14 = 210\n- Brick: 22 * 27 = 594\n- Ore: 21 * 36 = 756\n\nTotal value = 108 + 70 + 210 + 594 + 756 = 1738\n\nTo make a profitable trade, I should look to exchange resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but with potential for future gain. Since the values of resources are given, I'll start by considering trading resources with lower values for those with higher values.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. Wheat is the least valuable resource. Trading it for other resources could be beneficial.\n2. The most valuable resources are Ore and Brick. Focusing on acquiring more of these or maintaining their quantity could be beneficial.\n\nGiven that I have a good amount of Sheep, Brick, and Ore, I'll think about what I can offer that might be attractive to my opponent. \n\nSince I don't know the opponent's resources or their preferences, my initial strategy will be to make an offer that could potentially gain me more value. \n\nLet's offer some Wheat (the least valuable resource) and possibly other less valuable resources for more valuable ones. \n\nFor my first move, I'll consider offering some Wheat and possibly Wood (since it's relatively less valuable compared to others) for Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's start with: \n`[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (5*6) + (2*10) = 30 + 20 = 50 for 1 Ore worth 36. This is not a good trade for me as it stands because I'm giving away more value than I'm getting. Let's adjust our strategy.\n\nLet's think about a more balanced trade or one that could be attractive. \n\nSince Ore is very valuable and I already have a significant amount, I'll consider offering some of my less valuable resources for something that might be of more value to me or at least equal.\n\nLet's offer: \n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis is a trade of 5 Wheat (5*6 = 30) for 1 Brick (1*27 = 27). Still not ideal, as I'm getting less value.\n\nLet's rethink and directly consider a trade that involves more valuable resources.\n\n`[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis involves giving away (2*14) + (1*10) = 28 + 10 = 38 for 1 Ore (1*36 = 36). Still, not a great trade for me.\n\nLet's make a potentially more appealing offer for my opponent and adjust according to their response.\n\nFor now, I'll make an initial offer that might be attractive: \n`[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n\nLet's see how the opponent responds. \n\nSince I have to make a move, I'll go with the above offer and wait for the response.\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]`",

Earlier, they offered Sheep themselves, so they may be willing to exchange it.\n- If accepted, I convert surplus lower-value items into held Brick, positioning for future value growth.\n\nAlternative considerations:\n- I avoid trading Ore due to scarcity (only 7) and high value (33), or Wood which is mid-value.\n- Insufficient gain on Ore requests makes targeting Ore unfeasible without major loss.\n\nThis turn, no new offer from Player 0 is pending, so I must make an offer.
