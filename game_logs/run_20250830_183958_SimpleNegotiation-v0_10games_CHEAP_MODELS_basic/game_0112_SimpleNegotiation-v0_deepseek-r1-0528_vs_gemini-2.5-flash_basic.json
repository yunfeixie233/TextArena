Accepting this offer would decrease my total value.\n\nTherefore, I will deny this offer.\n\nNext, I need to consider making a counter-offer.

This is a gain of 2. It's small but positive.\n\nOffer Idea 2: Offer Wheat for Brick.\nIf I offer 5 Wheat (Value 25) for 1 Brick (Value 23). This is a loss of 2. Not good.\n\nOffer Idea 3: Offer Wood or Sheep for Ore.\nIf I offer 1 Wood (Value 12) and ask for 1 Sheep (Value 17) - gain 5. This is good.\nIf I offer 2 Wood (Value 24) and ask for 1 Brick (Value 23) - loss 1.

This means I lose.\n\nHow about giving up resources which I have a lot of.\nLet's try to offer Wheat for Sheep.\nI will offer 4 Wheat (value 20) and ask for 1 Sheep (value 17). This is a loss of 3 for me.\n\nThis is tricky. I need to make sure I *gain* value.\n\nLet's consider offering what I have a lot of (Wheat 22, Ore 24) and trying to get something valuable (Brick 23, Ore 32, Sheep 17).\n\nLet's try a small trade where I gain value.\nOffer: 3 Wheat (Value 15)\nRequest: 1 Sheep (Value 17)\nGain: 2\n\nThis is a positive trade for me.
