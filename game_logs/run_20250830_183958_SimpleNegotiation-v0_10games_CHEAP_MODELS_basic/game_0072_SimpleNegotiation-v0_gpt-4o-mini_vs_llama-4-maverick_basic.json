Since Ore has the highest value and I have a substantial quantity of it, I should try not to lose any Ore. I can offer resources with lower values in exchange for more Ore or try to negotiate with the resources I have.\n\nLet's think about a potential trade:\n- I can offer some Sheep (Value: 13) in exchange for Ore (Value: 38).\n\nPotential trade: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nCalculating the gain/loss:\n- Lost: 2 Sheep (2*13 = 26)\n- Gained: 1 Ore (1*38 = 38)\n- Net gain: 38 - 26 = 12\n\nThis trade is beneficial. \n\nMy next action will be: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
