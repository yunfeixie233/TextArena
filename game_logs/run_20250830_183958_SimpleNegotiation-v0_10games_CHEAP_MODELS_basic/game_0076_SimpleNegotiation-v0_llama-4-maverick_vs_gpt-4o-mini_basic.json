The goal is to increase the total value of resources.\n\n1. **Assess Current Total Value:**\n   - [Wheat]: 23 * 6 = 138\n   - [Wood]: 10 * 11 = 110\n   - [Sheep]: 19 * 16 = 304\n   - [Brick]: 13 * 23 = 299\n   - [Ore]: 13 * 35 = 455\n   \n   Total Value = 138 + 110 + 304 + 299 + 455 = 1306\n\n2. **Consider Potential Trades:**\n   - We need to identify which resources to trade. Ideally, we should offer resources with lower value and request resources with higher value or those that are scarce but valuable.\n\n3. **Proposed Trade:**\n   - One potential trade could involve offering some of the lower-value resources for higher-value ones. For example, offering Wheat (Value: 6) or Wood (Value: 11) for more valuable resources like Ore (Value: 35) or Brick (Value: 23).\n\nGiven the current state and the need to increase total value, a potential trade could be offering some Wheat for a more valuable resource. However, since Player 1 has not made a new offer, we should consider what we can propose that might be acceptable.\n\nLet's propose a trade that involves offering some Wheat and possibly another less valuable resource for a more valuable one.\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nLet's offer 8 Wheat and 2 Sheep for 1 Ore and 2 Brick, as we have plenty of Wheat and some Sheep, and Ore is very valuable.\n\nHowever, a more balanced and less risky initial proposal could be:\n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nLet's check if it's worth proposing such a trade.\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
