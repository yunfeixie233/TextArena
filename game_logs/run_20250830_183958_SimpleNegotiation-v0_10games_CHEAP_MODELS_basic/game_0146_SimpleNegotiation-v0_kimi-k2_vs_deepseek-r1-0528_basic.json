      "response": "### Thought Process:\n\n1. **Understand the Current State**: First, let's list out the current resources and their total values:\n   - Wheat: 8 qty * 6 = 48 total value\n   - Wood: 19 qty * 12 = 228 total value\n   - Sheep: 17 qty * 16 = 272 total value\n   - Brick: 25 qty * 29 = 725 total value\n   - Ore: 20 qty * 37 = 740 total value\n   - **Total Value**: 48 + 228 + 272 + 725 + 740 = 2013\n\n2. **Identify High-Value Resources**: Ore has the highest value per unit (37), followed by Brick (29), Sheep (16), Wood (12), and Wheat (6). To increase total value, we should aim to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones (ideally Ore or Brick).\n\n3. **Evaluate Current Quantities**:\n   - Wheat: 8 (lowest value, could trade some away)\n   - Wood: 19 (decent quantity, moderate value)\n   - Sheep: 17 (high quantity, moderate value)\n   - Brick: 25 (high quantity, high value, but already have a lot)\n   - Ore: 20 (high quantity, highest value)\n\n4. **Possible Trade Strategy**:\n   - Trade away Wheat (lowest value) for Ore or Brick.\n   - Trade Wood or Sheep for Ore.\n   - Avoid trading Ore away unless the return is exceptionally high.\n\n5. **Construct an Offer**:\n   - Since Wheat is the least valuable, let's offer some Wheat and perhaps another resource to get Ore. However, we have a lot of Wood and Sheep, so we can also consider trading those for Ore.\n   - Example: Offer 3 Sheep (3 * 16 = 48 value) and 2 Ore (2 * 37 = 74 value) to get 5 Brick (5 * 29 = 145 value) and 2 Sheep (2 * 16 = 32 value). But this is a loss:\n     - Giving away 48 + 74 = 122, receiving 145 + 32 = 177. This is actually a net gain of 55, but we have a lot of Brick already (25), so getting more Brick isn't the best unless we're trading away lower-value stuff.\n   - Better idea: Offer low-value resources to get Ore. For example:\n     - Offer 4 Wheat (4 * 6 = 24) and 2 Wood (2 * 12 = 24) for 1 Ore (37). This is a net gain of 37 - (24 + 24) = -11 (bad, don't do this).\n   - Another idea: Offer 5 Sheep (5 * 16 = 80) for 3 Ore (3 * 37 = 111). Net gain of 31. This seems good because we're trading moderate-value Sheep for high-value Ore.\n\n6. **Construct Trade Offer**:\n   - Optimal trade: Offer 5 Sheep (80) for 3 Ore (111). Net gain of 31.\n   - Format as: [Offer: 5 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\n\n7. **Check if this is reasonable**:\n   - The opponent may not accept a 5:3 ratio, but it's a starting point. If they reject, we can negotiate.\n\n### Final Action:\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 3 Ore]",

      "response": "Let me evaluate the latest offer first:\n\n**Latest offer from Player 1: 3 Wood \u2192 2 Sheep**\n\nCurrent values:\n- **3 Wood** = 3 \u00d7 (12 / 19) \u2248 1.89 value.\n- **2 Sheep** = 2 \u00d7 (16 / 17) \u2248 1.88 value.\n\nWhile it's close to a fair exchange, it slightly favors Player 1 (giving slightly more value than receiving). Since I have plenty of Sheep (17?), it's potentially acceptable.\n\nHowever, **Wood** is my *lowest-valuation* resource currently (12 for 19 units), making it the most expendable; and **Sheep** is one of my stronger resources (16 for 17 units). I don't gain much (actually trading Sheep for Wood reduces my average value per resource).\n\nInstead, I'll **counter with my own proposal** that continues to push for higher-value resources while still appealing to Player 1.\n\nI need **Ore** most (value 37, high scarcity) followed by **Brick** (value 29). I have excess **Sheep** (value 16) and **Wood** (value 12), with **Wheat** (value 6) being my least valuable.\n\nSo, a *more generous* offer toward Player 1's needs (Wood, Wheat) while securing Ore/Brick:\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Wheat \u2192 2 Ore, 1 Brick]",
