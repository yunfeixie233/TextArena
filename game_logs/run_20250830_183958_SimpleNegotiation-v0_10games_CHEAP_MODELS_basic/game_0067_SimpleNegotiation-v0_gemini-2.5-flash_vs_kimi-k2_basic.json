I will try to offer 4 Wood for 1 Ore again, assuming the previous rejection was due to the opponent not liking their previous inventory.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the previous successful trade: 1 Ore + 1 Sheep (value 35 + 14 = 49) for 4 Wood (value 32). This was a good trade for me, as I got resources worth 49 for resources worth 32.

Inverting that tells me he/she will probably also trade Brick for Ore, since Brick has the same value (24 pts).\n\n**What would improve my score the most right now?**  \nI already have 94 pts worth of resources. The low-value items are the 11 Wheat and the 11 Wood. I\u2019d like to convert them into higher-value goods without touching my Ore (if possible).\n\n**Aim**  \nConvince Player 0 to give me at least **2 Brick** in exchange for **3 Wood** (an even-value swap, 11 vs 11) \u2013 it is clearly better for him/her than the 1-for-1 he/she tried, and still acceptable to me.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]",
