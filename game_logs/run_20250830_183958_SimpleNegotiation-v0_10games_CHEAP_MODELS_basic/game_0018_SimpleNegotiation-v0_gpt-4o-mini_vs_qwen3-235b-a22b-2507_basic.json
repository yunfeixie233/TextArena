Here are some potential offers I could consider based on my resources:\n\n1. **Offer 4 Sheep** (Value: 64) for **2 Ore** (Value: 74): \n   - Gain higher value resources at the cost of relatively lower value.\n   - New total value will increase.\n\n2. **Offer 5 Wheat** (Value: 25) for **1 Brick** (Value: 27):\n   - This provides a slight increase in value with a balanced trade between resources.\n\n3. **Consider wood trades** if I find an imbalance with opponents needing it, as it has moderate value.\n\n### Sample Trade Offer\nFor Turn 1, I\u2019ll make my first trade offer:\n\n**Offer:** \n`[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]`\n\nThis trade proposal aims to provide a beneficial exchange by getting high-value items (Ore and Brick) in return for relatively lower-value items (Sheep and Wheat). \n\nLet\u2019s see how my opponent responds to this offer!",
