Sheep: Qty = 19, Value = 14\n4. Brick: Qty = 19, Value = 24\n5. Ore: Qty = 14, Value = 40\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources through trading.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of my current resources:\n- Total Value = (18 * 6) + (19 * 12) + (19 * 14) + (19 * 24) + (14 * 40)\n- Total Value = 108 + 228 + 266 + 456 + 560\n- Total Value = 1618\n\nTo increase this total value, I need to identify which resources are more valuable and try to acquire more of the higher-value resources or maintain the quantity of the highest-value resources I already have.\n\nThe highest value resources I have are Ore (Value = 40), Brick (Value = 24), Sheep (Value = 14), and Wood (Value = 12). Wheat (Value = 6) is the least valuable.\n\nLet's start by making an offer that could potentially increase my total value. I have a lot of Brick and a significant amount of Ore. I can try to trade some of my lower-value resources for more Ore or maintain my current high-value resources.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of my lower-value resources for Ore. Let's try to offer 5 Wheat (relatively low value) for 1 Ore (high value).\n\nMy offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis is my first move. I will wait for your response to proceed.",
