      "response": "Before I make an offer, I need to know what the other player has. I can't see the other player's inventory, so I'll start by making an offer that would be beneficial to me based on my current inventory. I'll prioritize trading away resources I have in high quantities, especially if their value is lower, and try to gain resources that are more valuable or that I have less of.\n\nI have a lot of **Brick (19)** and a lot of **Ore (20)**. While **Ore** is valuable, I can potentially trade some lower value **Brick** for more valuable resources like **Sheep** or **Ore** (if the opponent has it, and it makes sense). I also have a fair amount of **Wheat (12)** which has the lowest value.\n\nLet's try to offload some **Wheat** and **Brick** to get **Ore** or **Sheep**.\n\nMy goal is to increase the *total value* of my resources.\n\nI'll start with an offer that seems reasonable to get a more valuable resource.\n\nCurrent total value:\nWheat: 12 * 6 = 72\nWood: 6 * 9 = 54\nSheep: 11 * 14 = 154\nBrick: 19 * 24 = 456\nOre: 20 * 37 = 740\n**Total Value: 1476**\n\nLet's offer some less valuable resources for something more valuable.

I want to *increase* my total value.\n\nIf I offer something, its value should be less than what I request.\n\nI have 19 Brick (Value 24) and 12 Wheat (Value 6).\n\nHow about:\nOffer: 5 Wheat (30) + 2 Brick (48) = 78\nRequest: 2 Sheep (28) + 1 Ore (37) = 65\n\nStill not quite right. I want to receive more value than I give.\n\nLet's try trading away some **Wheat** (lowest value) and **Brick** (high quantity) for **Ore** (highest value).\n\nConsider:\nOffer: 5 Wheat (5 * 6 = 30) + 3 Brick (3 * 24 = 72) = 102\nRequest: 3 Ore (3 * 37 = 111)\n\nThis would increase my total value by 111 - 102 = 9.
