To respond effectively, I need to consider a move that not only supports my existing 'O' in the center but also prepares for potential future moves by both players.\n\nGiven that I have 'O' in cell 4, a strategic response would be to place 'O' in a corner. This approach has multiple benefits:\n\n1. **Corner Control**: Occupying a corner allows me to potentially create a strong diagonal or prepare for a future row/column win.\n2. **Flexibility**: By not committing to an immediate adjacent position to 'X', I maintain flexibility for my next move.\n\nLet's choose the top-left corner (cell 0) for my next 'O'.
