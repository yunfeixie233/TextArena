      "response": "As Player O, analyzing the board:  \n- Diagonal 0-4-8 is a critical threat. I control positions 0 and 4 (both O), so placing at 8 secures an immediate victory.  \n- Opponent has no immediate winning threats: top row is blocked (O-X-X), diagonal 2-4-6 is neutralized by my center O, and no other lines have two enemy marks.  \n- Corner 8 not only wins but forces opponent into a losing position regardless of future moves.  \n\n**Winning move**: [8]  \n\n*Placement rationale*: This exploits the established diagonal control from initial strategy while capitalizing on opponent's overextension in the top row.
