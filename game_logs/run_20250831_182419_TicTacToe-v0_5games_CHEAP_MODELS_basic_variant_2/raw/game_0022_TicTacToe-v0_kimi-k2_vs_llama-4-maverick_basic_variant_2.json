      "observation": "\n[GAME] You are operating as Player 0 in this Strategic Tic Tac Toe engagement.\nYour objective is to establish a tactical line of three marks aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\nExecute your strategy by selecting any available cell position (numbered 0-8) using the specified format.\nStrategic example: '[0]' secures the top-left corner position.\n\nYour tactical marker is 'O', opposing the enemy's 'X' marker.\n\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] To respond effectively, I'll analyze the current state of the board.\n\nThe current board looks like this:\n\n0 |1 |2 \n---+---+---\n3 | O |5 \n---+---+---\n6 |7 |8 \n\nGiven that Player0 (the opponent) has placed their 'O' in cell 4, I need to place my 'X' in a strategic position. The best initial response is to occupy a corner or a position that gives me flexibility for my next move.\n\nSince the center is taken by 'O', I'll choose a corner. The top-left corner (0) seems like a good starting point because it allows for the possibility of creating a line in multiple directions.\n\nMy move: '[8]' is an alternative corner, but let's start with a more central-corner adjacent position or directly take a corner.\n\nLet's place 'X' in the top-right corner, position 2.\n\nMy move: '[2]'\n\nSo, the command is: '[2]'\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [6]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To respond effectively, I'll analyze the current state of the board.\n\nThe current board looks like this:\n\n0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\nO | 7 | X \n\nGiven that Player 0 (the opponent) has placed their 'O' in cell 6, I need to reassess and place my 'X' in a strategic position. \n\nSince I previously decided to place 'X' in the top-right corner (2) but ended up placing it in position 8, and now the board is in this state, my next move should be to occupy a position that counters the opponent's potential three 'O's in a row and also sets me up for a potential win.\n\nLet's look at the available moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'. \n\nPlacing 'X' in position 2 (top-right corner) is a good move as it was my initial intention and allows for a potential line in multiple directions. It also counters the opponent's 'O' in position 6 by preparing for a potential diagonal or other strategic alignments.\n\nMy move: '[2]'\n\nSo, the command is: '[2]'\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To respond effectively, I'll analyze the current state of the board.\n\nThe current board looks like this:\n\n X |1 |2 \n---+---+---\n O | O |5 \n---+---+---\n O |7 | X \n\nGiven that Player0 (the opponent) has placed their 'O' in cell3, I need to reassess and place my 'X' in a strategic position that counters the opponent's potential three 'O's in a row and also sets me up for a potential win.\n\nLet's look at the available moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[5]', '[7]'.\n\nSince the opponent has three 'O's in a column in positions 3, 6 (vertically), they are close to winning. To counter this, I should place my 'X' in a position that blocks their winning line or creates a potential winning line for myself.\n\nPlacing 'X' in position7 will block the opponent's potential win and is a good strategic move.\n\nMy move: '[7]'\n\nSo, the command is: '[7]'\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [0]\n[GAME] Player 0 attempted an invalid move.
