      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first assess the current situation and the resources I have.\n\nResources I currently have:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 13   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 13   Value: 10\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 12   Value: 15\n- [Brick]   Qty: 5    Value: 25\n- [Ore]     Qty: 22   Value: 34\n\nTotal value of my resources = (13*5) + (13*10) + (12*15) + (5*25) + (22*34)  \n= 65 + 130 + 180 + 125 + 748  \n= 1248\n\nThe last offer from Player 0 was: 10 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 5 Ore. I rejected it.\n\nTo decide on my next action, let's evaluate the offer made by Player 0:\n- They are offering 10 Wood (10*10 = 100 value) and 5 Wheat (5*5 = 25 value), totaling 125 value.\n- In return, they are requesting 5 Ore (5*34 = 170 value).\nSince 125 (offered value) is less than 170 (requested value), the offer is not in my favor, and rejecting it was a good decision.\n\nNow, let's consider making a new trade offer. To increase my total value, I should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value if it strategically benefits me (e.g., by completing a set or getting rid of surplus).\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering resources that are of lower or comparable value for Ore or other high-value resources since Ore is the highest value resource I have. However, giving away too much Ore might not be strategic.\n\nLet's examine an alternative:\n- I have a surplus of Wheat and Wood relative to Brick. Trading some Wheat or Wood for Brick could be beneficial since Brick has a higher value than both Wheat and Wood.\n\nConsider the following potential trade offer:\n- Offering 5 Wheat (value = 25) for 1 Brick (value = 25) seems like an equal trade in terms of value. However, it could be beneficial to acquire more Brick if possible at a lower value.\n\nA potential offer: `[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nLet's check the value: \n- 6 Wheat = 6*5 = 30 value\n- 1 Brick = 25 value\nThis is not favorable.\n\nLet's consider another resource:\n- Offering some Wood or Sheep for Brick or Ore. Since Ore is very valuable, let's consider trading for Ore if possible.\n\nExample: `[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n- 3 Sheep = 3*15 = 45 value\n- 1 Wood = 1*10 = 10 value\nTotal offered = 55 value\n- 1 Ore = 1*34 = 34 value\nThis is not favorable as I'm losing value.\n\nLet's directly craft a more sensible offer:\n`[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 3 Ore]`\n- Offered: 5 Wood (5*10 = 50) and 2 Wheat (2*5 = 10), total = 60 value\n- Requested: 3 Ore (3*34 = 102 value)\n\nThis offer is still not good because I'm offering 60 value for 102 value, which is not beneficial.\n\nRevisiting the idea of trading for Brick since it's the next highest value after Ore and I have a low quantity of it:\n`[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n- 4 Wood = 4*10 = 40\n- 1 Brick = 25\nThis is not favorable.\n\nLet's adjust our thinking:\n`[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]`\n- 2 Sheep = 2*15 = 30\n- 1 Brick = 25\nStill not favorable.\n\nLet's directly examine a potentially beneficial trade with the resources and the last known offer in mind.\n\nSince my previous reasoning didn't directly result in a straightforward offer, and considering that making a bad trade could decrease my total value, I'll directly propose a trade that could potentially benefit me:\n\nLet's directly offer something that could be a starting point for negotiation:\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]`\n\nTo make this decision, I calculated:\n- 3 Wheat = 3*5 = 15\n- 2 Wood = 2*10 = 20\nTotal offered = 35\n- 2 Ore = 2*34 = 68\n\nThis is still a losing trade.\n\nLet's think about what I can offer that might be more acceptable and also think about what I've got and what I can spare.\n\nUpon careful consideration, a more reasonable trade is hard to formulate without directly losing value. Thus, my next action is to make a trade offer that might initiate a beneficial exchange or to wait and see if Player 0 makes a more appealing offer.\n\nMy next action will be:\n`[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 3 Brick]`\n\nLet's check the value:\n- 4 Sheep = 4*15 = 60\n- 3 Brick = 3*25 = 75\n\nThis trade seems somewhat favorable as I'm gaining 15 value. \n\n`[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 3 Brick]`",

This was not a good trade for Player 1 since it results in a loss of value (30 for 25). Thus, the rejection by Player 0 was expected, but it was also a good decision for Player 1 as it stands.\n\n2. **Consider the current resources and potential trades**: \n   - Giving away Wheat (low value) for other resources could be beneficial if the received resource has a significantly higher value.\n   - The same logic applies to Wood.\n   - Sheep, Brick, and Ore have higher values. It's more beneficial to acquire these or maintain them.\n\n3. **Potential trades**:\n   - Consider offering Wheat or Wood for higher-value resources like Brick or Ore.\n   - Since Brick has a high value and is relatively scarce for Player 1 (Qty: 5), acquiring more could be beneficial.\n   - Ore is abundant (Qty: 22), so giving some away might be reasonable if it results in acquiring something of higher total value.\n\nLet's examine a potential trade:\n- Offering 4 Wood (4 * 10 = 40) for 2 Brick (2 * 25 = 50) would be a gain in total value (receiving 50 value for 40 value). This could be a viable trade.\n\nThus, a potential trade offer could be: `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Brick]`.\n\nLet's make this trade offer.\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wood, 0 Wheat, 0 Sheep, 0 Ore -> 2 Brick]`\n\nHowever, to adhere strictly to the format, we simplify it:\n`[Offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Brick]`",
