Brick: Qty = 11, Value = 26\n5. Ore: Qty = 19, Value = 35\n\nFirst, we should look for potential trades that increase our total value. \n\nLet's calculate the total value of the resources we currently have:\n- Total Value = (15*6) + (7*11) + (7*14) + (11*26) + (19*35)\n- Total Value = 90 + 77 + 98 + 286 + 665\n- Total Value = 1216\n\nTo make a meaningful first move, we need to think about what resources are relatively overvalued or undervalued for us and what we can offer or request. \n\nLet's examine the values and quantities:\n- High-value resources we have: Ore (35) and Brick (26)\n- Lower-value resources we have: Sheep (14), Wood (11), Wheat (6)\n\nWe should look to trade resources that are less valuable for us to those that are more valuable. However, without knowing the opponent's resources, we'll have to make an educated guess based on the values.\n\nLet's make an initial offer that involves trading some of our lower-value resources for higher-value ones or consolidating resources. \n\nFor instance, we could think about offering some Wheat (low value) and possibly other relatively lower-value resources for something more valuable. However, we need to be cautious not to devalue our total resources.\n\nA possible initial offer could involve:\n- Offering Wheat (the lowest value resource) for a more valuable resource.\n\nLet's propose:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\nThis is a reasonable start because we're offering a relatively low-value resource (Wheat, Value = 6) in exchange for a higher-value resource (Brick, Value = 26). The quantity is chosen somewhat arbitrarily for this initial offer; we're testing the waters.\n\nSo, my action for Turn 1 is:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'",

One strategy is to offer resources with lower value in exchange for resources with higher value.\n\n3. **Consider Player 1's Perspective**: Player 1 rejected offers involving Wheat for Brick and Sheep. This might indicate that either Player 1 has sufficient Wheat or is not willing to trade higher-value resources for Wheat.\n\n4. **New Trade Offer**: Let's consider offering Wood (Value: 11) for Sheep (Value: 14) or Brick (Value: 26). Offering 2 Wood for 1 Sheep or 1 Brick could be a potential trade.\n\n5. **Proposed Trade**: I'll offer 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep.
