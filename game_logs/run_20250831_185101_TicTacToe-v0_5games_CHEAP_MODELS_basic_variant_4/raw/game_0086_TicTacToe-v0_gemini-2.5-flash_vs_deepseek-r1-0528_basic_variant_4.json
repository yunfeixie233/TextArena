The board is:\n\n X |   | O \n---+---+---\n   | O |   \n---+---+---\n X |   | O \n\nAvailable moves: [1], [3], [5], [7]\n\nI notice an immediate winning opportunity:  \n- Column 0 has my marks at positions 0 (top) and 6 (bottom). Playing in position [3] (middle-left) would complete a vertical line for three X's:  \n  - Cell 0 (X) + Cell 3 (my move) + Cell 6 (X) = win.  \n\nAdditionally, I evaluated opponent threats:  \n- Player 0 (O) has no immediate winning path. Their diagonal (cells 2-4-8) has two O's, but cell 6 (the third spot) is already my X, blocking a win there.  \n- Their row 1 or column 1 can be threatened later, but since I can win now, no need to prioritize them.  \n\nThus, playing [3] ends the game in my victory.\n\n [3]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] Based on the current board:\n\n```\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n```\n\nAvailable moves: [5], [7]\n\nAnalysis:\n- Playing [7] would create a diagonal threat (position 6-7-8 for X), but it's not a winning move since the top-right cell is O\n- However, leaving cell 5 open allows opponent to win immediately by completing row 1 (positions 3-4-5 would become O-O-O)\n- If I play [7], opponent plays [5] and wins the game with three O's in the middle row\n- Playing [5] blocks opponent's winning move while leaving no immediate win threats (game continues to draw)\n\n**Best move: [5]** to block opponent's winning opportunity.\n\n[5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[7]'",
