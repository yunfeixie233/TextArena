Let's play a friendly game of Tic Tac Toe.\nThe idea is simple: get three of your marks lined up in any row, column, or diagonal.\nJust pick which square you want (they're numbered 0 through 8) and put it in brackets.\nLike this: '[8]' puts your mark in the bottom-right spot.\n\nYou'll be playing with 'O' marks, and your friend is using 'X' marks.\n\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] Since I'm playing as 'X', I'll place my mark in position 8.\n\n[8]\n\nSo, the updated move is: [8]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  [0]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] Since I'm playing as 'X', I'll place my mark in position 5.\n\n[5]\n\nSo, the updated move is confirmed by the game rules. I'll wait for the game to update. \n\nLet's see... \n should update to reflect my move.\n\nCurrent state before my move:\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nMy move: [5]\n\nExpected state after my move:\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nLet me know the outcome.\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  [2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] Since I'm playing as 'X', I'll analyze the current state of the board and plan my next move.\n\nCurrent state:\n O | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[6]', '[7]'\n\nMy goal is to get three 'X' marks in a row, column, or diagonal. I already have two 'X' marks, one at position 5 and one at position 8. To increase my chances of winning, I should try to create a potential line with my next 'X' mark.\n\nLet's examine the available moves:\n- '[1]': Placing 'X' at position 1 would be a good starting point, as it could potentially lead to a row or column with three 'X' marks if I can control the adjacent squares.\n- '[3]': Placing 'X' at position 3 would put it in the same row as the 'O' mark at position 4. This could be a good move if I can follow up with another 'X' mark in the same row or column.\n- '[6]': Placing 'X' at position 6 would start to build a potential row or column with three 'X' marks at the bottom of the board.\n- '[7]': Placing 'X' at position 7 would put it adjacent to my existing 'X' mark at position 8, making it a potentially strong move.\n\nAfter considering the available options, I'll place my next 'X' mark at position 7.\n\n[7]\n\nLet's see how the game updates. \n\nExpected state after my move:\n O | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | X \n\nI'll wait for the game to confirm the update.\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]   [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To continue the game, let's analyze the current state of the board.\n\nCurrent state:\n O | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[6]', '[7]'\n\nMy goal is still to get three 'X' marks in a row, column, or diagonal. I currently have 'X' marks at positions 5, 8, and 7 is still available.\n\nLet's examine the available moves:\n- '[6]': Placing 'X' at position 6 would put it in the same column as my 'X' mark at position 8 (if I had placed it at 7) or could potentially create a row with three 'X' marks if I consider the bottom row.\n- '[7]': Placing 'X' at position 7 would put it adjacent to my 'X' mark at position 8, making it a strong move to potentially get three 'X' marks in a row at the bottom.\n\nHowever, I should correct that my last move was actually placed at position 1, not 7. Now, I need to analyze the current state and decide on the next move.\n\nGiven the current state and available moves, I'll place my next 'X' mark at position 7.\n\n[7]\n\nLet's see the outcome.\n\nExpected state after my move:\n O | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | X \n\nI'll wait for the game to update.\n\nPlease confirm the outcome.\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[7]'",
