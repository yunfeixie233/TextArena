That\u2019s not a diagonal.\n  - Let's list O positions: 1, 4, 8\n    - Row 1: 1 \u2014 not aligned\n    - Column: 1 and 4 are in middle column (positions 1,4,7) \u2014 yes! O is in 1 and 4, and 7 is empty.\n    - Diagonal: 0,4,8 \u2014 but 0 is X, so not O.\n    - Other diagonal: 2,4,6 \u2014 4 is O, 2 and 6 are not O (6 is X).\n  - So: Column 1 (squares 1,4,7) \u2014 O has 1 and 4, 7 is empty. Threat: if O plays 7, they win.\n\nCritical threat: If I don't block, O will play 7 next and win vertically in column 1.\n\nAlso check if I have any winning moves:\n- My X's are in 0 and 6.\n- Bottom row (6,7,8): X at 6, O at 8, so 7 is key. But if I play 7, I block O and don\u2019t complete a three \u2014 only two X\u2019s.\n- First column (0,3,6): X at 0 and 6 \u2014 that\u2019s two! If I play square 3, I\u2019ll get three X\u2019s in column 0.\n\nWait: positions 0, 3, 6 are the first column (left column).\n- 0: X\n- 3: empty\n- 6: X\n\nSo if I play [3], I complete the column and win!\n\nAvailable moves: [2], [3], [5], [7]\n\n[3] is both a winning move and blocks nothing (but I don\u2019t need to block when I can win).\n\nSo playing [3] gives me three X's in the first column: 0, 3, 6.\n\nMy move: `[3]`",
