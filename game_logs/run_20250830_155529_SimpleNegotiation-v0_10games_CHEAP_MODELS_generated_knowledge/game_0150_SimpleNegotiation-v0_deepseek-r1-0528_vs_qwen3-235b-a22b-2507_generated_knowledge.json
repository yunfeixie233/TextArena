Now, I want to test a different resource pairing that could be more appealing to Player 1 while still benefiting my overall value.\n\nI currently have 7 Wood, valued at 12 each. Since Wood is moderately valuable but not critical for me, and I have a surplus, I\u2019ll offer one Wood for one Sheep. This trade is beneficial to me because I value Sheep (18) higher than Wood (12), resulting in a net gain of 6 in my resource value. Player 1 might accept if they have a surplus of Sheep or highly value Wood\u2014a reasonable assumption given the uncertainty in their valuation.\n\nHere's my offer:  \n**[Offer: 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep]**",
