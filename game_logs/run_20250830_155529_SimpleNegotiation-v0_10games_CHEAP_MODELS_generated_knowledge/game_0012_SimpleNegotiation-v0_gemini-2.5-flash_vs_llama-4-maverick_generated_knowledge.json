The value of 12 Wheat is 12, and the value of 3 Brick is approximately 5.45 (3 * 20/11). This trade is not favorable because it involves giving away more value than received.\n\nHowever, let's consider our goal: to increase the total value of our resources. We currently have 5 Wheat and 11 Brick. If we accept this offer, we'll have:\n- Wheat: 5 + 12 = 17\n- Brick: 11 - 3 = 8\n\nLet's assess the new total value:\n- Wheat: 17 * 1 = 17\n- Wood: 11 * 1.09 = 12\n- Sheep: 8 * 2.25 = 18\n- Brick: 8 * 1.82 = 14.55 (approximately)\n- Ore: 11 * 3.18 = 35\n\nNew Total Value = 17 + 12 + 18 + 14.55 + 35 = 96.55\n\nThe new total value after accepting the offer is approximately 96.55, which is more than our current total value of 90.
