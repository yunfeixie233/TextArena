My current inventory with values:\n\n- Wheat: 5 (value 5)\n- Wood: 19 (value 11)\n- Sheep: 19 (value 18)\n- Brick: 16 (value 26)\n- Ore: 15 (value 38)\n\nThe value for each resource is the **per-unit value** of that resource.

Aim to trade **lower value items for higher value items**.  \n2. Since most of my items (except Wheat) are mid-to-high value, *Brick is the only item valued lower than its stack, while Ore is my most valuable*.  \n3. Avoid parting with Ore unless I get *a lot* of items that individually are worth even more (unlikely).  \n4. I\u2019d love more Brick (26 per unit) and still have plenty of Sheep (18) and Wood (11), which I can afford to give up if the return is good.  \n5. Avoid over-trading if it leaves me short on *diversity*\u2014sometimes shortages can be exploited.\n\nPlan for first offer\nI want to consolidate into higher-value goods. Brick (26) gives me the best boost per unit, and Player 1 might be willing to give some Brick. I propose:\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]\n\n*This way I \u201cpay\u201d 4\u00d718 + 3\u00d711 = 72 + 33 = 105 points.*  \n*I ask for 2\u00d726 + 1\u00d738 = 52 + 38 = 90 points.*  \n\nNet \u20149 (slightly negative). I price this MARKET-like **slightly in my favor** because the other player might counter to even out. I\u2019m open if they send a counter.\n\nMy message to the table:\n\u201cLet\u2019s kick things off: I\u2019d be happy to trade 4 Sheep & 3 Wood for 2 Brick plus 1 Ore.

The goal is to increase the total value.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. We have a good amount of Ore, which is one of the most valuable resources. Trading it away might not be the best unless we get something of significantly higher total value in return.\n2. We have a substantial amount of Brick, another valuable resource. Similar to Ore, we should be cautious about trading it away.\n3. Sheep is also valuable, and we've just increased our quantity.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some of our less valuable resources or those that are not as highly valued per unit but are in surplus relative to our needs or the game's context.\n\nConsidering the current quantities and values:\n- Offering Wheat (least valuable per unit) or some Wood could be a starting point. However, we need to figure out what to request in return.\n\nLet's evaluate making an offer. If we offer 2 Wheat (total value = 10), we could potentially ask for 1 Brick (Value: 26), which would be a gain.\n\nThus, a potential offer could be: `[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nLet's calculate:\n- Giving 2 Wheat: 6 - 2 = 4 Wheat left\n- Receiving 1 Brick: 12 + 1 = 13 Brick\n\nNew total value if the offer is accepted:\n- Wheat: 4 * 5 = 20 (instead of 30)\n- Wood: 96 (no change)\n- Sheep: 165 (no change)\n- Brick: 13 * 26 = 338 (instead of 312)\n- Ore: 462 (no change)\n\nTotal value = 20 + 96 + 165 + 338 + 462 = 1081\n\nThis trade increases our total value from 1065 to 1081.\n\nTherefore, my action for this turn is: `[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`",
