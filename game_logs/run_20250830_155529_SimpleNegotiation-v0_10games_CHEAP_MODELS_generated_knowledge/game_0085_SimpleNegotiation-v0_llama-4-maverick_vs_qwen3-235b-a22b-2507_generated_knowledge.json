Wheat - Qty: 16, Value: 5\n2. Wood - Qty: 5, Value: 9\n3. Sheep - Qty: 15, Value: 18\n4. Brick - Qty: 13, Value: 26\n5. Ore - Qty: 17, Value: 38\n\n**Total Value:**  \nTo simplify, I'll calculate the total value of the resources I currently have.  \n- Wheat: 16 * 5 = 80  \n- Wood: 5 * 9 = 45  \n- Sheep: 15 * 18 = 270  \n- Brick: 13 * 26 = 338  \n- Ore: 17 * 38 = 646  \n**Total:** 80 + 45 + 270 + 338 + 646 = 1379\n\n### Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value, I need to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or at least equal value if it sets up a future beneficial trade. Given the values, Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\n### Initial Trade Offer\n\nSince Ore is the most valuable and I have a substantial quantity, I should be cautious not to give away too much Ore. However, having a good amount of other resources can be beneficial. \n\nLet's examine a potential trade:\n\n- I have a relatively high quantity of Sheep (Value: 18) and Brick (Value: 26), and I'm looking to trade something for potentially higher value or more quantity.\n\nConsidering the values:\n\nI'll start by offering to trade some Wheat (the lowest value resource) for Wood (the next lowest value but still relatively low).  \n**Offer:** `[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Wood]`\n\nThis is a test to see if the opponent is willing to make a trade and to gauge their resource availability.\n\n**Turn 1 Action:** `[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Wood]`",

This indicates that either the offers were not favorable for Player 1, or Player 1 had other priorities or resources they were willing to trade.\n   - The rejected offers were:\n     - 8 Wheat (Value: 40) for 2 Wood (Value: 18): Player 0 lost value.\n     - 5 Wheat (Value: 25) for 1 Ore (Value: 38): Player 0 gained value.\n     - 3 Sheep (Value: 54) for 1 Ore (Value: 38): Player 0 lost value.\n\n3. **New Offer Strategy:**\n   - Since the last offer (3 Sheep for 1 Ore) resulted in a loss of value for Player 0 and was rejected, we need to rethink the strategy.\n   - Player 0 should aim to either maintain or increase the total value of resources.\n   - Noting the values and quantities, a potential strategy is to offer resources of lower value or surplus in exchange for higher value resources.\n\n### New Offer\n\nGiven the history and the current state, let's formulate a new offer that could be beneficial:\n\n- **Offer:** `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Wood]`\n  - Offered: 4 Wheat (Value: 20)\n  - Requested: 1 Wood (Value: 9)\n  - **Rationale:** While this offer still results in a net loss of value for Player 0, it's a smaller loss compared to the previous offers.

      "response": "After analyzing the current situation, I will make a new trade offer.\n\nThe current state of my resources is:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 12   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 6    Value: 9\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 15   Value: 18\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 13   Value: 26\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 17   Value: 38\n\nI previously offered 8 Wheat for 2 Wood and was rejected. Then I offered 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, 3 Sheep for 1 Ore, and 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, all of which were rejected. However, when I offered 4 Wheat for 1 Wood, it was accepted. \n\nConsidering the rejections and the acceptance, it seems that Player 1 is willing to trade 1 Wood for 4 Wheat. I will try to make another offer that is similar but potentially more beneficial to me.\n\nMy next offer will be: [Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Wood]\n\nThis offer is made to see if Player 1 is willing to trade 2 Wood for a combination of resources. Since they accepted 4 Wheat for 1 Wood, I am offering a mix that still includes a relatively valued resource (Wheat) and adding some Sheep to it.\n\nThe response will be either [Accept] or [Deny] from Player 1, and I will react accordingly.\n\nMy action for this turn is: [Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Wood]",
