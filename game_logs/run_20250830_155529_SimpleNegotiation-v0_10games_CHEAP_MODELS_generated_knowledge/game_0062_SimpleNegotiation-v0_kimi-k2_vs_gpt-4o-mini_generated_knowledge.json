Brick is low (5) but high-value (24). Sheep/Wheat/Wood are lower-value per unit.\n   - **Strategy**: \n     - Try to get Brick (since I have only 5, and it's high-value).\n     - Offer Sheep/Wheat/Wood in exchange for Brick or Ore.\n     - Alternatively, accumulate more Brick if possible.\n\n4. **New Offer**:\n   - **Offer Ratio**: 1 Brick is worth ~3.5 Sheep (24/17 ~ 1.41, reverse is ~0.71 Brick per Sheep). Previous offer was 2 Sheep for 1 Brick (undervalued).\n   - **Adjust**: Try offering more Sheep for Brick to make it attractive. \n   - **New Offer**: 3 Sheep for 1 Brick (Value: 3*17 = 51 vs 1*24 = 24). This seems worse on value, but Brick scarcity might justify it.

Trading away Ore could be highly beneficial if receiving Brick (value 24) or Sheep (value 17) in return.\n   - Player 0 has low Wood (7) and low Sheep (7), so trading for these might not be optimal unless the exchange is highly favorable.\n   - Player 0 has 8 Brick, which is sufficient, so trading away Brick could be an option if the return is high (e.g., for Ore).\n\n4. **Next Trade Goal**:\n   - Try to trade high-value Ore or excess Brick for more Wood or Sheep to diversify and increase total value. However, Wood and Sheep are lower value, so the trade must be carefully weighted.\n   - Alternatively, trade Ore for more Brick if possible, as Brick is valuable and can be used in future trades.\n\n5. **Next Trade Offer**:\n   - Offer: 1 Ore (value 32) in exchange for 1 Wood (value 11) + 1 Sheep (value 17) = 28. Net loss of 4 value, but this diversifies resources and might prepare for future trades.\n   - However, this is not ideal.
