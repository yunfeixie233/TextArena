      "response": "Based on the current state of trades and resources, here is how to proceed strategically:\n\n**Current Resources after Player 0 accepted the trade offer:**\n- Wheat: 14  (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 8   (Value: 10)\n- Sheep: 10 (Value: 13)  (after giving away 4 Sheep)\n- Brick: 3  (Value: 30)  (after receiving 3 Brick)\n- Ore: 24   (Value: 40)\n\n**Next Steps:**\nSince Player 0 has 10 Sheep, 3 Brick, and plenty of Ore, the aim should be to trade resources in a way that increases overall value. Given that the quantities are still good, Player 0 can look to trade resources that are not as valuable for more valuable ones, such as aiming for more Brick or potentially Steel or valuable items.\n\nHere\u2019s a new trade offer from Player 0:\n\n**Trade Offer:**\n- **[Offer: 2 Ore, 3 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 2 Sheep]**\n\nThis way, you are using less valuable resources (Wheat has a value of 5, and Ore has a value of 40, but you\u2019ll still have enough Ore afterward). You are trading for 3 Brick which has a higher value, and gaining 2 Sheep keeps your Sheep numbers strong.\n\n**Proceed with the offer:**\n- **[Offer: 2 Ore, 3 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 2 Sheep]**",
