      "response": "Let me examine what just happened.  \n- I started with: 22 Wheat (6), 17 Wood (10), 17 Sheep (16), 11 Brick (20), 16 Ore (38)  \n- After the first trade that was accepted (-9 \u20113 +1) my counts are now  \n\u2003Wheat 13, Wood 17, Sheep 14, Brick 11, Ore 17\n\nValue I lost: 9\u00b76 + 3\u00b716 = 54 + 48 = 102  \nValue I gained: 1\u00b738 = 38 \u2003\u2192 I am down 64 in absolute terms.  Clearly that first deal was terrible\u2014but the past cannot be changed.\n\nMy goal is now to claw back value on the remaining turns.  \nOre remains my most valuable item (38).  Player 1 keeps offering 1 Ore for 3\u20134 of my cards, clearly valuing it extremely highly.  Rather than accept those bad deals, I want to flip the direction and see if I can get bulk value for cheap Wheat or Brick that I now have relative to Player 1\u2019s needs.  \nSince I\u2019m rationing to 10 turns and several turns have already passed, I should quickly test whether Player 1 is willing to part with their now-scarce Ore at a more reasonable ratio\u2014say 2-for-1 with secondary goods.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
