Total value is 1,268.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Ore has the highest individual value (32), so I should trade away other resources to get more Ore when possible\n- Wheat has the lowest individual value (6), making it my primary trade bait\n- I'm quite strong in Brick relative to demand\n- Sheep might be overstocked\n\n**Strategy:**\nI should offer trades that:\n1. Look slightly favorable to my opponent\n2. Actually increase my total value when I get higher-value Ore in return\n3. Use my abundance of low-value Wheat and excess Sheep/Brick\n\n**Opening Approach:**\nI'll approach Player 1 and test what they're willing to trade. Overcoming their natural suspicion is key. I'll offer an exchange where they get volume resources they need while I get higher-value Ore.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood]",
