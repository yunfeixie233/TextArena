This reduces my overall resource value.  \n- **My new offer**: I propose trading 1 Ore for 2 Wheat and 2 Wood. This gives me 2\u00d75 (10 from Wheat) + 2\u00d712 (24 from Wood) = 34 in value received, which exceeds my Ore's value (32), netting me a +2 gain.  \n\nI believe this counter-offer is fair and leans into your pattern of valuing Ore highly based on your previous trade proposals.
