I will focus on acquiring more [Ore] and [Brick], as they have the highest value. I am willing to trade [Wheat], [Wood], and [Sheep].\n\nPlayer 1 rejected my previous offer of \"2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore\". This indicates that Player 1 values Ore highly, and perhaps my offer was too low, especially considering the relatively low value of Wheat and Wood.\n\nI need to make a more appealing offer for Ore or Brick. Since I have a good amount of Wood and Brick, and I am trying to acquire Ore, I will try to offer something that Player 1 might value more. I have a lot of Wood and Brick, so I can try to use them as well.\n\nLet's try to offer a higher quantity of lower-value goods, or a mix that is more appealing.\n\nMy strategy for this turn will be to offer a more significant amount of lower value resources for Ore, as Player 1 rejected the previous offer. I will try to offer a combination of Wheat and Sheep, as I have a decent quantity of both.\n\nLet's propose: Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore.\nValue of 3 Wheat = 3 * 6 = 18\nValue of 2 Sheep = 2 * 16 = 32\nTotal offered value = 18 + 32 = 50\n\nValue of 1 Ore = 39\n\nThis offer gives Player 1 a higher value in goods (50) for a lower value good (39).
