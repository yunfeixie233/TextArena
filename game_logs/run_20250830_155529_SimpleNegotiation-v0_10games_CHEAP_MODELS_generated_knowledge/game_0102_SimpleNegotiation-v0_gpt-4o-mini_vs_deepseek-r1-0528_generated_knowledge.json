While I appreciate the offer, I can't proceed with this trade as it stands. However, I'm open to a different exchange that benefits both of us.\n\nI propose trading some of my lower-value resources for your Sheep, which I can use more effectively. Specifically, I offer 2 Wheat and 2 Wood in exchange for 2 Sheep. This trade would give you useful resources for your settlements while allowing me to reallocate my inventory.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Sheep]",
