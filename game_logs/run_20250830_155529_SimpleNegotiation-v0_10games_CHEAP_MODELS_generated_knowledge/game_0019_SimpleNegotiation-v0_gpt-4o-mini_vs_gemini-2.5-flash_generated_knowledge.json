      "response": "The current offer from Player 0 is: Offered items: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> Requested items: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\n\nLet's analyze this offer.\n\n**Player 0 is offering:**\n*   3 Sheep (Value: 3 * 17 = 51)\n*   2 Ore (Value: 2 * 40 = 80)\nTotal value offered by Player 0: 51 + 80 = 131\n\n**Player 0 is requesting:**\n*   5 Brick (Value: 5 * 29 = 145)\n*   2 Sheep (Value: 2 * 17 = 34)\nTotal value requested by Player 0: 145 + 34 = 179\n\n**From Player 1's perspective (my perspective):**\n*   If I accept, I will **receive** 3 Sheep and 2 Ore, with a total value of 131.\n*   If I accept, I will **give away** 5 Brick and 2 Sheep, with a total value of 179.\n*   My net change in value: 131 (received) - 179 (given) = -48.\n\nThis offer would decrease my total value, so I should not accept it.\n\nNow, I need to make a counter-offer. My goal is to increase my total value. I have a good quantity of all resources, but Brick and Ore have high values.\n\nLet's try to get more high-value items for lower-value items, or simply make a profit on a trade.\n\nHere's my current inventory and values:\n*   [Wheat]   Qty: 13   Value: 6\n*   [Wood]    Qty: 23   Value: 12\n*   [Sheep]   Qty: 25   Value: 17\n*   [Brick]   Qty: 15   Value: 29\n*   [Ore]     Qty: 21   Value: 40\n\nI have a lot of Sheep and Wood. Perhaps I can trade some of those for Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's consider an offer where I give away some lower-value items for higher-value items.\n\n**Option 1: Trade Sheep and Wood for Ore.**\n*   Offer: 5 Sheep, 5 Wood\n    *   Value: (5 * 17) + (5 * 12) = 85 + 60 = 145\n*   Request: 3 Ore\n    *   Value: 3 * 40 = 120\n    *   This gives Player 0 a profit. I want the profit.\n\n**Option 2: Trade Sheep and Wood for Brick.**\n*   Offer: 4 Sheep, 4 Wood\n    *   Value: (4 * 17) + (4 * 12) = 68 + 48 = 116\n*   Request: 4 Brick\n    *   Value: 4 * 29 = 116\n    *   This is a neutral trade for me. I need to gain value.\n\nLet's try to get Ore. Ore has the highest value.\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of lower value resources for a smaller amount of higher value resources?\n\n**Counter-Offer Idea:**\nI want to gain high value items (Ore, Brick) by giving lower value items (Wheat, Wood, Sheep).\n\nLet's try to get 1 Ore and 1 Brick, by giving away Sheep and Wood.\n*   Desired: 1 Ore (40) + 1 Brick (29) = 69\n*   Offer: 3 Sheep (51) + 2 Wood (24) = 75. (My value goes down)\n\nLet's try to make a positive value trade for myself.\n\n**My Offer:** I want to give resources with total value X and request resources with total value Y, where Y > X.\n\nHow about I offer items that I have in abundance (Sheep, Wood) for items that are valuable (Ore, Brick)?\n\nConsider a simpler trade:\nI offer: 8 Sheep (8 * 17 = 136)\nI request: 3 Ore (3 * 40 = 120) - *This is a bad trade for me.*\n\nLet's offer a combination of resources.\n\n**Player 1's Offer:**\nI will offer some Sheep and Wood for some Ore.\n*   Offer: 6 Sheep, 5 Wood\n    *   My cost: (6 * 17) + (5 * 12) = 102 + 60 = 162\n*   Request: 4 Ore\n    *   Value received: 4 * 40 = 160\n    *   This is almost neutral for me, slightly negative.\n\nLet's reverse it to my advantage. I offer something of less value, for something of higher value.\n\n**My plan for the counter-offer:**\n1.  Deny Player 0's current offer as it's not beneficial.\n2.  Make a counter-offer that increases my total value.\n\nI have strong quantities of Wheat (13), Wood (23), Sheep (25).\nI want more Brick (29) and Ore (40).\n\nLet's propose:\n*   Give away: 10 Sheep (10 * 17 = 170)\n*   Receive: 5 Brick (5 * 29 = 145) + 1 Ore (1 * 40 = 40) = 185\n    *   My gain: 185 - 170 = +15 in value. This looks good.\n\nI need to make sure I don't run out of a resource. 25 Sheep is plenty to offer 10.\n\nLet's consider another:\n*   Give away: 5 Wood (5 * 12 = 60) + 5 Sheep (5 * 17 = 85) = 145\n*   Receive: 5 Brick (5 * 29 = 145) - This is a neutral trade. I don't want neutral.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\n*   Offer: 7 Sheep (7 * 17 = 119)\n*   Request: 3 Ore (3 * 40 = 120)\n    *   Gain of 1 value. This is a very small gain.\n\nLet's be bolder.\nI want to turn my abundance of lower-value goods into higher-value goods.\n\nMy current resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 13   Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 23   Value: 12\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 25   Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 15   Value: 29\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 21   Value: 40\n\n**Final Offer Strategy:**\nI will offer a mix of my plentiful resources (Sheep, Wood) for a higher value resource (Ore).\n\n*   My Offer: 10 Sheep, 5 Wood\n    *   Value: (10 * 17) + (5 * 12) = 170 + 60 = 230\n*   My Request: 6 Ore\n    *   Value: 6 * 40 = 240\n    *   **My Net: +10 value.** This is a good trade for me, and seems reasonable enough for Player 0 to consider, as Ore is a high-value resource.\n\nI will first deny Player 0's offer, then make my counter-offer.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 10 Sheep, 5 Wood -> 6 Ore]",
