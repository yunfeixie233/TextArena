I\u2019d lose 67 points!\n\nThat\u2019s obviously bad for me. Since I only have 5 Brick and my opponent keeps trying to pry it away with undervalued trades, I\u2019ll stop throwing out any offers that include my Brick. Instead, I can flip the script and sell some of my surplus Wood and Wheat to get the Brick I need while extracting high value.\n\nNew turn, so:\n\n[Talk] \u201cLooks like we\u2019re stuck on Brick. I can supply commodities you actually need. How about 19 Wood (value 209) and 15 Wheat (value 75) for your 9 Brick (value 207)? That\u2019s a fair 284-for-207 swap\u2014nice gain for you, and I get Brick to keep building.\u201d\n\n[Offer: 19 Wood, 15 Wheat \u2192 9 Brick]",
