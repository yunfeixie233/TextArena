      "response": "Given the current situation in the Negotiation Game, Player 0 needs to decide how to respond to Player 1's latest offer.\n\nPlayer 1 has offered:\n- **Offered items**: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood \n- **Requested items**: 2 Sheep \n\nPlayer 0 has the following resources:\n- Wheat: 20\n- Wood: 9\n- Sheep: 18\n- Brick: 16\n- Ore: 18\n\nAnalyzing Player 1's offer, here are the implications:\n- By accepting, Player 0 would give away 2 Sheep in exchange for 3 Wheat and 1 Wood. \n- This trade could be valuable as it would allow Player 0 to increase resource diversity and utilize surplus Wheat (as Player 0 has a large quantity).\n\nSince Player 0 has a significant amount of resources, Player 0 needs to carefully consider if the trade will lead to a net gain in total value. As Player 0 doesn't feel this offer directly improves their position, I will respond as follows:\n\nPlayer 0's response:\n[Denial]\n\nIf Player 0 is not interested in Player 1's offer, they can also make a new offer based on remaining resources or wait for Player 1 to make another offer after this decline. Here\u2019s an option for the next move:\n\nNew trade offer from Player 0:\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]\n\nThis offer aims to exchange surplus Wheat for Sheep, which Player 0 might find valuable after assessing the trade landscape.",
