      "response": "Ah, a negotiation game! My goal is to increase the value of my resources. I'll need to be strategic in my offers, aiming to give away less valuable resources for more valuable ones, or to get more quantity of resources I need.\n\nLet's look at my current inventory and values:\n* Wheat: 18 @ 5 = 90\n* Wood: 20 @ 11 = 220\n* Sheep: 25 @ 13 = 325\n* Brick: 7 @ 20 = 140\n* Ore: 17 @ 34 = 578\n\nTotal Value: 90 + 220 + 325 + 140 + 578 = 1353\n\nMy most valuable resource is Ore, followed by Brick. Wheat is the least valuable. I have a lot of Sheep. I have very little Brick.\n\n**Turn 1 Strategy:**\nI want to increase my Brick and Ore, and potentially offload some Wheat, Wood, or Sheep. I'll start by making an offer that gives away cheaper resources for more valuable ones. I have a good amount of Sheep, and it's mid-value, so I can use that as a trade item.\n\nI will try to get more Brick, as I have so few of it.\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\nThis values my Sheep at 13 each (total 65) vs Brick at 20 each (total 40). This is a pretty good deal for me in terms of value increase if it goes through (I pay 65 to get 40, which seems like a loss, but it's about shifting resource types. If I value brick more than sheep, then this is good). No, wait, that's not how it works. I need to get more value.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. I want to trade low-value items for high-value items, or more quantity of high-value items.\n\n**Revised Turn 1 Strategy:**\nLet's try to get Ore or Brick by giving away Wheat or Wood. I have a lot of Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Brick]\nMy value: 10 * 5 = 50.\nTheir value (what I want): 3 * 20 = 60.\nThis is a positive value trade for me if they accept, and it helps me get more of the valuable Brick. It uses up my cheapest resource.",
