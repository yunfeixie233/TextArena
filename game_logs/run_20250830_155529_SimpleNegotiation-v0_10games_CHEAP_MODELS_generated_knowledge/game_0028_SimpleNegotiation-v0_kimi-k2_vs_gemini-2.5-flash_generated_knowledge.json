This increased my value by 2 Ore (80) -> 3 Brick (75). Actually, this was a bad trade! My apologies. I was calculating quickly. I lost 5 value. I must be more careful.\n\nLet's re-evaluate.

Player 0 wanted 115 value for 126 value. That was a bad deal for me.\n- Player 0 offered: 2 Ore (80) for 3 Brick (75). This was a bad deal for me. I rejected it.\n- I offered: 2 Ore (80) for 3 Brick (75). Player 0 accepted. This means *I* made a bad trade. I need to be careful with the arithmetic.\n\nI need to make an offer where I gain value.\nI want to get more Brick or Ore, or items that are more valuable per unit.\nI have a lot of Sheep. Can I trade Sheep for Brick or Ore?\n\nConsider trading Sheep (18) for Brick (25).\nIf I give 1 Sheep (18), I want more than 18 value in return.\nIf I give 2 Sheep (36), I want more than 36 value in return.\nCould I get 2 Brick (50) for 2 Sheep? This would be me getting 50 value for 36 value.\nWhat about this: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick (25). This would be me giving 36 and getting 25. Bad.\n\nWhat about Wheat (5) for Wood (12)?\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (15), I could ask for 1 Wood (12). This would be a 3 value loss.\nIf I offer 2 Wheat (10), ask for 1 Wood (12). This is a gain of 2 value for me.\n\nLet's try to trade something I have a good quantity of (high overall value) for something that is still high value, or I can get a good ratio.\n\nI have 23 Sheep (Value 18).\nI have 17 Wheat (Value 5).\n\nOffer Wheat, get something\nIf I offer 5 Wheat (25), can I get 1 Brick (25)? No gain.\nIf I offer 4 Wheat (20), can I get 1 Wood (12)? Bad for me.\n\nWhat about trading up from Wood or Sheep to Brick or Ore?\nLet me try to trade Sheep for Brick.\nI want to offer less value and get more value.\nIf I offer 4 Sheep (72), can I get 3 Brick (75)? This would be a gain of 3. This is a small gain, but a gain.\nLet's try this.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 3 Brick]",
