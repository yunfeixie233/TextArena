My Ore quantity is quite low. Ore is also my most valuable resource per unit.\n\nI'm looking to increase my total value. Since Ore is valuable and I have few, I'll aim to acquire more Ore, potentially by trading away some of the more abundant, lower value resources. Brick is also high value, and I have a decent quantity, so I might trade that if it significantly increases my Ore or other high-value resources.\n\nLet's make an opening offer.
