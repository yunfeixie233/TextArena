Brick (20) is the lowest-value resource I possess. Losing 1 Brick still nets me only 20/24 \u2248 0.83 points per Brick, the worst among all my goods, so thin-out trades are not appealing.\n2. Wood (0.8 pt) and Wheat (1.0 pt) also provide below-average marginal utility.  \n3. Ore, at 2.0 pt apiece, is my highest-density value; trading Ore away hurts unless I receive \u22652.0 pt per Ore.\n4. Sheep (1.0 pt) are plentiful but not as dense as Ore; they make flexible fillers.\n\nBest strategy\n- Target **more Ore** when possible, because its value-per-unit is highest.  \n- Give away my lower-density goods\u2014especially Wood and Wheat\u2014to increase average value per unit.  \n- Keep about 3-5 Brick/Ship as liquidity for future trades.\n\nPositioning message for Player 1\nI open with a friendly tone and a small \u201ctest-offer\u201d so I can learn Player 1\u2019s preferences while exchanging low-value goods.\n\n\u201cHi!
