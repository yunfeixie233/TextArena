      "response": "As Player 0, I have been actively trading to increase the total value of my resources, leveraging past successful trades with Player 1 to inform my strategy. My current resources are:\n\n- **Wheat**: 8 units (value = 5 each, total 40)  \n- **Wood**: 7 units (value = 9 each, total 63)  \n- **Sheep**: 5 units (value = 13 each, total 65)  \n- **Brick**: 22 units (value = 25 each, total 550)  \n- **Ore**: 18 units (value = 33 each, total 594)  \n\nTotal value is 1,312.  \n\n### Analysis:\n- Based on trade history, Player 1 has accepted multiple Sheep-heavy offers, indicating they may value Sheep or be accumulating them. Offers involving Sheep for Ore/Brick have been mutually beneficial when the ratio favors my valuation (e.g., giving Sheep to gain higher-value Ore/Brick worked well in past trades).\n- I now have only 5 Sheep left, so I must be cautious not to deplete them unless the trade offers significant value gain. Sheep is less valuable than Brick or Ore (13 vs 25/33) but more valuable than Wheat (13 vs 5) or Wood (13 vs 9).\n- Wheat and Wood have the lowest per-unit values for me (5 and 9), so trading them for Sheep or other higher-value resources could increase my total value if I get a favorable exchange.\n- Player 1 rejected similar offers in later turns (e.g., 3 Sheep for 2 Brick was rejected after initial acceptance) and made an offer involving Wheat and Sheep, suggesting their willingness or need for Wheat may be conditional. However, I must test new combinations to find viable trade opportunities.\n- My goal is to offload low-value resources (Wheat/Wood) for Sheep or other assets, avoiding overuse of Brick or Ore.\n\n### Current Negotiation Strategy:\nI propose an offer that gives Player 1 resources they may need (Wheat/Wood) in exchange for Sheep, which I value higher. This way:\n- I achieve a net value gain (19 given vs. 39 received \u2192 +20).\n- My Sheep stock increases, allowing potential future trades involving Sheep if Player 1 remains interested.\n- The offer is low-risk; if rejected, I lose nothing, and Wheat/Wood are abundant enough to spare.\n\nWith Sheep in short supply, I avoid large offers involving Ore or Brick unless necessary. I make this offer:\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 3 Sheep]",
