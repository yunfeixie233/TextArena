      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to analyze the current situation and make informed decisions about potential trades. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of my current resources:\n- Wheat: 8 * 6 = 48\n- Wood: 11 * 11 = 121\n- Sheep: 23 * 14 = 322\n- Brick: 20 * 24 = 480\n- Ore: 24 * 34 = 816\n\nTotal value = 48 + 121 + 322 + 480 + 816 = 1787\n\nTo increase the total value, I should look for trades that give me resources with higher values or more quantity of resources that are already valuable to me.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the Current Resources and Their Values\nI have a good mix of resources, but I need to identify which ones are more valuable and could potentially be traded for something of greater value.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the Most Valuable Resources\nOre is the most valuable resource per unit, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat. I have a significant quantity of Ore, Brick, and Sheep.\n\n## Step 3: Consider Potential Trades\nTo increase my total value, I could consider offering resources that are less valuable per unit or that I have in surplus for resources that are more valuable or that complement my existing resources.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a Trade Offer\nSince I have a lot of Ore and Brick, which are valuable, I should be cautious not to give away too much of these. However, I can consider trading some of my less relatively valuable resources (in terms of quantity or per unit value) for something that could potentially increase my total value.\n\n## Step 5: Make an Initial Trade Offer\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (the least valuable per unit and relatively less in quantity compared to others) and possibly some Wood for a resource that could be valuable. However, without knowing the opponent's resources, a direct offer might not be straightforward.\n\n## Step 6: Decide on the First Offer\nGiven that Wheat is the least valuable resource per unit and I have 8 units of it, I could offer some Wheat in exchange for a more valuable resource. Let's say I offer 4 Wheat for 1 Brick (since Brick is more valuable than Wheat).\n\n## Step 7: Format the Trade Offer\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\nThis is my first trade offer. I will wait for the opponent's response.\n\nMy action for Turn 1 is: [Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

Given that Wheat is valued at 6 and Brick at 24, the offer was disproportionately favorable to Player 1 (4*6 = 24 vs 1*24 = 24). The quantity of Wheat offered was too high in value compared to the Brick requested.\n- The second offer (3 Wood -> 2 Ore) was also rejected. Here, Wood is valued at 11 and Ore at 34. The offer equates to (3*11 = 33) for (2*34 = 68), which is still somewhat favorable to Player 1 but not as skewed as the first offer.\n\n#### Strategy for Next Turn:\nTo improve the chances of a successful trade, we need to reassess the value exchange and potentially adjust our offer to be more mutually beneficial or less disadvantageous.\n\n1. **Re-evaluate Resource Values**: We should look for resources that are relatively less valuable to us but potentially more valuable to Player 1, and vice versa.\n   \n2. **Consider Alternative Trades**: Since our previous offers were rejected, we should consider trading resources that are less critical or surplus to our current state for resources that are more valuable.\n\nGiven that our previous offers were rejected, let's consider making an offer that is potentially more balanced or favorable to both parties.\n\n### Proposed Trade for Next Turn:\nLet's examine a potential trade involving resources that might be more appealing to both parties.\n\n- **Potential Trade**: Offer 2 Sheep -> Request 1 Ore\n  - **Value Exchange**: (2*14 = 28) for (1*34 = 34)\n  - **[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**\n\nThis trade is still somewhat one-sided in favor of Player 1 in terms of value, but it involves resources that we have in surplus (Sheep) and a resource we need (Ore) that is highly valued.\n\n### Action:\n`[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds to this offer.",

Current Value: 6  \n  Total Value: 8 * 6 = 48\n  \n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 11 - 2 = 9 (offered 2 Wood for 1 Ore in the last turn but was not accepted), Value: 11  \n  Total Value: 9 * 11 = 99\n  \n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 23 + 5 - 0 = 28 (gained 5 Sheep from the accepted trade), Value: 14  \n  Total Value: 28 * 14 = 392\n  \n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 20 - 1 = 19 (gave away 1 Brick in the accepted trade), Value: 24  \n  Total Value: 19 * 24 = 456\n  \n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 24 - 1 = 23 (gave away 1 Ore in the accepted trade), Value: 34  \n  Total Value: 23 * 34 = 782\n\nTotal value before this turn = 48 + 99 + 392 + 456 + 782 = 1777\n\nAfter receiving 5 Sheep and 2 Wheat and giving away 1 Ore and 1 Brick in the last accepted trade, the new quantities and total values are correctly calculated above.\n\n### Evaluating the Current Offer\n\nPlayer 1 made a new offer: **[Offer: 4 Brick -> 5 Ore]**.\n\n- If accepted, Player 0 will give away 5 Ore and receive 4 Brick.\n- Current Ore quantity: 23, Value: 34. After giving away 5 Ore: 23 - 5 = 18 Ore, Total Value: 18 * 34 = 612.\n- Current Brick quantity: 19, Value: 24. After receiving 4 Brick: 19 + 4 = 23 Brick, Total Value: 23 * 24 = 552.\n\n### Calculating the Change in Total Value\n\n- Loss from giving away 5 Ore: 5 * 34 = 170.\n- Gain from receiving 4 Brick: 4 * 24 = 96.\n\nNet change = -170 + 96 = -74.\n\nThe total value after accepting the offer would be 1777 - 74 = 1703.\n\n### Decision\n\nAccepting the offer results in a decrease in total value (from 1777 to 1703), which is not beneficial.\n\n### Response\n\nSince accepting the offer is not advantageous, the best course of action is to deny it.\n\n'[Deny]'",
