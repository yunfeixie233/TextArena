To do this, I need to identify resources that are undervalued or overvalued relative to others. Resources with higher values per unit are more valuable, so I should try to acquire more of the highest-value resources if possible.\n\n### Initial Offer\n\nUpon reviewing my resources and their values:\n- The highest-value resource I have is **[Ore]** at 32 per unit.\n- The lowest-value resource I have is **[Wheat]** at 6 per unit.\n\nTo increase my total value, I could consider trading away some of my lower-value resources for higher-value ones or maintaining a balance that allows for future advantageous trades.\n\nLet's make an initial offer that could potentially increase my total value. I will offer some **[Wheat]** (the lowest value resource) and see if I can get a more valuable resource in return.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nI will offer 4 **[Wheat]** in exchange for 1 **[Ore]** (since Ore is the highest value resource and I have relatively fewer units of it).\n\n**Action:**\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis trade would give me an additional unit of Ore (increasing my total value by 32) and cost me 4 units of Wheat (reducing my total value by 4*6 = 24). The net gain would be +8 in total value if the trade is accepted.\n\nLet's see the opponent's response.",

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the current situation and the offers made so far.\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 8, Value: 6\n   - Wood: 5, Value: 12\n   - Sheep: 22, Value: 16\n   - Brick: 14, Value: 26\n   - Ore: 7, Value: 32\n\n2. **Previous Offers and Responses:**\n   - Player 0 offered 4 Wheat for 1 Ore. Player 1 rejected.\n   - Player 0 offered 3 Wood for 1 Ore. Player 1 rejected.\n   - Player 0 offered 2 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Ore. Player 1 rejected.\n   - Player 1 offered 1 Ore for 4 Wood.\n\nGiven that the goal is to increase the total value of resources, let's examine the offer made by Player 1: **1 Ore for 4 Wood**.\n\n- **Current Value of Resources Involved:**\n  - 1 Ore: 32\n  - 4 Wood: 4 * 12 = 48\n\nThe offer requires giving away 4 Wood, which has a value of 48, to gain 1 Ore, valued at 32. This trade would decrease the total value of resources by 16 (48 - 32 = 16).\n\nSince the trade offered by Player 1 is not favorable (it decreases the total value of resources), the best response would be to **reject** this offer.\n\nLet's consider making a new offer. We have been trying to get Ore in exchange for other resources. Given that Ore is highly valued (32), and our previous attempts to get it by offering Wheat and/or Wood have been rejected, we might want to consider offering a different resource or combination that could be more appealing.\n\nLet's analyze what we have and what we could offer:\n- We have a significant quantity of Sheep (22), which is valued at 16. Offering some Sheep might be more attractive to Player 1.\n\nConsidering this, a potential new offer could involve Sheep. For instance, offering a certain quantity of Sheep in exchange for Ore might be more appealing.\n\nLet's examine the possibility of trading Sheep for Ore. We could consider an offer like: **[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**.\n\n- **Value Calculation:**\n  - 2 Sheep: 2 * 16 = 32\n  - 1 Ore: 32\n\nThis trade maintains the value, as we're giving away resources worth 32 for resources worth 32. It doesn't increase our total value but doesn't decrease it either. However, we need to consider if it's worth it given the quantities we have.\n\nLet's directly evaluate the best next step.\n\nMy action for this turn will be: `[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`. \n\nThis is under the assumption that Player 1 might be more willing to accept an offer involving Sheep, and it maintains our current total resource value.",

      "response": "### Step 1: Review Current Resources and Values\n\nAfter accepting the trade offer from Player 1, my resources have changed. Let's review the current state:\n\n- Initially, I had:\n  - [Wheat]   Qty: 8    Value: 6\n  - [Wood]    Qty: 5    Value: 12\n  - [Sheep]   Qty: 22   Value: 16\n  - [Brick]   Qty: 14   Value: 26\n  - [Ore]     Qty: 7    Value: 32\n\n- After the trade:\n  - I gave: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat\n  - I received: 5 Brick\n  - New quantities:\n    - [Wheat]   Qty: 8 - 2 = 6\n    - [Wood]    Qty: 5 - 3 = 2\n    - [Sheep]   Qty: 22 (no change)\n    - [Brick]   Qty: 14 + 5 = 19\n    - [Ore]     Qty: 7 (no change)\n\nSo, the current state is:\n  - [Wheat]   Qty: 6    Value: 6\n  - [Wood]    Qty: 2    Value: 12\n  - [Sheep]   Qty: 22   Value: 16\n  - [Brick]   Qty: 19   Value: 26\n  - [Ore]     Qty: 7    Value: 32\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Current State and Decide on the Next Action\n\nThe total value of my resources before the trade was: (8*6) + (5*12) + (22*16) + (14*26) + (7*32) = 48 + 60 + 352 + 364 + 224 = 1048.\n\nAfter the trade, the total value is: (6*6) + (2*12) + (22*16) + (19*26) + (7*32) = 36 + 24 + 352 + 494 + 224 = 1130.\n\nThe trade increased my total value from 1048 to 1130.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Possible Trades for the Next Turn\n\nTo maximize the total value, I should consider trading resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable or negotiating for a better quantity.\n\nGiven the current values:\n- [Wheat] is the least valuable at 6 per unit.\n- [Wood] is relatively low in quantity and moderate in value.\n- [Sheep] are abundant but have a moderate value.\n- [Brick] are now more abundant and have a high value.\n- [Ore] is very valuable.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate a Trade Offer\n\nSince [Ore] is very valuable and I have a relatively low quantity of it, I should try to acquire more. However, my previous attempts to trade for [Ore] were rejected. Let's consider an alternative.\n\nI could offer some of my less valuable resources for [Ore] or other valuable resources. Given that [Wheat] is the least valuable, I could try to trade it.\n\nLet's formulate an offer: \n- Offer 4 Wheat (Value: 4*6 = 24) for 1 Ore (Value: 32).\n\nThis trade would increase my total value: I lose 24 value for [Wheat] but gain 32 value for [Ore], resulting in a net gain of 8.\n\n### Step 5: Execute the Trade Offer\n\nThe trade offer is: [Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore].\n\nLet's check if this is correctly formatted: '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'.\n\n### Response\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
