Value: 5 * 5 = 25\n   - 10 Sheep: I have 8, so I don't have enough Sheep to fulfill this request. Thus, I cannot accept this offer as it stands because I'm short of 2 Sheep.\n\nSince I don't have enough Sheep to fulfill Player0's request, I must deny the offer.\n\nMy action: `[Deny]`\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. I need to think about what I can offer and what I need.\n\nTo make a valuable trade, I should think about what I have in abundance and what I lack or what is less valuable to me. \n\nGiven my resources, I have a lot of Ore (Value:34) and Brick (Value:29), but I'm somewhat limited in Sheep (Value:14). I could consider offering some of my less valuable resources for something more valuable or for more quantity of a resource.\n\nFor instance, I could think about offering some Wheat (least valuable) or Wood (second least valuable) for something more valuable.\n\nLet's make an offer: I could offer some Wheat and/or Wood for more Sheep or other valuable resources.\n\nPotential counteroffer: `[Offer:5 Wheat,2 Wood -> 3 Sheep]`\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer:5 Wheat,2 Wood -> 3 Sheep]`\n\nLet's calculate:\n- Giving away: 5 Wheat (Value: 5*5 = 25) and 2 Wood (Value: 2*11 = 22), Total value given = 25 + 22 = 47\n- Receiving: 3 Sheep (Value: 3*14 = 42), so I'm actually losing value in this specific trade.\n\nLet's think about a different counteroffer that could be more beneficial or less costly.\n\nAlternative: `[Offer:2 Wheat,1 Wood -> 2 Sheep]`\n\n- Giving away: 2 Wheat (Value: 10) and 1 Wood (Value: 11), Total value given = 10 + 11 = 21\n- Receiving: 2 Sheep (Value: 2*14 = 28)\n\nThis seems like a slightly more reasonable trade since I'm gaining value (28 - 21 = 7).\n\nMy action for this turn: `[Offer:2 Wheat,1 Wood -> 2 Sheep]`\n\nLet's see how Player0 responds.",

Wheat: 9 * 5 = 45\n2. Wood: 9 * 11 = 99\n3. Sheep: 12 * 14 = 168\n4. Brick: 11 * 29 = 319\n5. Ore: 20 * 34 = 680\nTotal Value = 45 + 99 + 168 + 319 + 680 = 1311\n\n### After Accepting the Trade:\n1. Wheat: 9 * 5 = 45 (no change)\n2. Wood: 9 * 11 = 99 (no change)\n3. Sheep: 12 + 3 = 15 * 14 = 210\n4. Brick: 11 - 2 = 9 * 29 = 261\n5. Ore: 20 * 34 = 680 (no change)\nTotal Value = 45 + 99 + 210 + 261 + 680 = 1295\n\nAccepting this trade would decrease our total resource value by 16 (1311 - 1295).\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that accepting the trade decreases our total resource value, the best action is to reject the offer.\n\n### Action:\n`[Deny]`\n\nWe will now wait for the next turn to see if Player 0 makes another offer or to make a new offer ourselves. \n\n### Next Step:\nSince we have rejected the offer, we should consider making a new offer that could potentially increase our resource value. \n\nLet's directly propose a new offer.\n\n### New Offer:\nConsidering our current resources and values, a potential trade could involve offering resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but in a beneficial quantity.\n\nOne possible trade is to offer some Wheat (lower value) or Wood (moderate value) for Ore (higher value), as we have a considerable amount of Wheat and Wood.\n\nLet's propose: `[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nCalculating the values:\n- 6 Wheat = 6 * 5 = 30\n- 1 Ore = 1 * 34 = 34\n\nThis trade slightly increases our value, so it's a reasonable offer.\n\n### Action:\n`[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's proceed with this action.",
