      "response": "Let\u2019s stop and think strategically rather than just keep flinging blind offers.\n\nWhat do we (Player-0) really want?\n\n- Brick is our only resource worth less than the card\u2019s face value (Brick 23 vs the 5,10,12,34 for the others).  \n- Yet for most of the game Player-1 has been asking for **our** brick or offering just one ore to take brick away.  \n- Our goal is simple: **trade away surplus low-value cards and hoard the high-value ones (ore)**.\n\nSurplus low-value cards we\u2019re willing to part with:\n \u2013 Wheat (qty 19, value only 5)  \n \u2013 Wood (qty 13, value 10)  \n \u2013 Sheep (qty 12, value 12)  \nWe have plenty brick (18) as well but should only use it if we\u2019re improving our long-term total.\n\nTherefore a win-win offer is one where we supply the low-demand goods, not the high-demand ones like ore, and collect **ore**. Player-1 seems interested in brick; let\u2019s supply it at full value and collect ore.\n\nMy proposal:\n\n[Offer: 4 Brick, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
