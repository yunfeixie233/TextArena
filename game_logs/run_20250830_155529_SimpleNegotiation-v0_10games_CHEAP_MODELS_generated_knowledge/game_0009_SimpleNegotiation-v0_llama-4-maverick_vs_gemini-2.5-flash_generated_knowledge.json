      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I should analyze the current values and quantities I have, and then decide on a trading strategy.\n\n### Current Resources and Values:\n1. Wheat   - Qty: 5, Value: 6\n2. Wood    - Qty: 17, Value: 8\n3. Sheep   - Qty: 10, Value: 17\n4. Brick   - Qty: 6, Value: 23\n5. Ore     - Qty: 20, Value: 33\n\n### Initial Total Value Calculation:\n- Wheat: 5 * 6 = 30\n- Wood: 17 * 8 = 136\n- Sheep: 10 * 17 = 170\n- Brick: 6 * 23 = 138\n- Ore: 20 * 33 = 660\n- Total Value = 30 + 136 + 170 + 138 + 660 = 1134\n\n### Strategy:\nTo increase the total value, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or at least maintain the current value while optimizing for future trades. My resources are quite diverse, but I notice that Ore has the highest value and I have a substantial quantity of it. However, I should also consider the value and quantity of other resources.\n\n### First Turn:\nSince I have a good amount of Ore and its value is high, I should be cautious about trading it away. However, I can look for opportunities to trade resources that are less valuable for something of equal or greater value.\n\nLet's examine possible trades:\n- I have a lot of Wood (Value: 8) and some Wheat (Value: 6), which are among the lower-value resources. Trading some of these for resources that could potentially increase or maintain my total value could be a good strategy.\n\n### Trade Offer:\nConsidering my resources and the goal to increase total value, a reasonable first step could be to offer some of my lower-value resources in exchange for something of higher or comparable value.\n\nI will offer: '[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 5 Sheep]'.\n\nThis translates to: '[Offer: 5*6 + 5*8 -> 5*17]' or '[Offer: 30 + 40 -> 85]', which simplifies to '[Offer: 70 -> 85]'. This is a positive trade as it increases my total value.\n\n### Action:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 5 Sheep]'",
