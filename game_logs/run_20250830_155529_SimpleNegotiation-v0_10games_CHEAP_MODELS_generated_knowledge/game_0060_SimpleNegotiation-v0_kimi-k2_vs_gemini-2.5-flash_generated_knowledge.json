      "response": "I\u2019m already carrying what the opponent last proposed (2 Ore \u2192 5 Sheep, 1 Wood) and I have rejected it four times in a row. Re-iterating that same deal will not change the outcome, so I\u2019ll propose something different that still moves me to higher-value resources.\n\nCurrent inventory\n- Wheat  5  (5 total value)\n- Wood  11 (10 total value)\n- Sheep 23 (12 total value)\n- Brick 7  (21 total value)   \u2190 scarce, highly-valued\n- Ore   22 (40 total value)   \u2190 scarce, highly-valued\n\nBrick is the item the opponent has shown zero willingness to part with (all of their offers give Ore for Sheep/Wood). That means I should not try to acquire more Brick in this phase; instead I should consolidate Sheep into Ore (my high-value item) at a ratio that beats the 2.5 Sheep-per-Ore rate they keep pushing.\n\nWhenever you post, you must write something, so:\n\nPlayer 0: \u201cWe\u2019ve been going in circles. I\u2019ll sweeten my last Sheep-for-Ore deal: take 6 Sheep for 3 Ore \u2013 that\u2019s exactly 2-for-1, better than the 2.5-for-1 you keep asking.\u201d\n\n[Offer: 6 Sheep -> 3 Ore]",
