      "response": "Alright, let's break this down step by step to figure out the best move.\n\n1. **Current Situation and Goals**:\n   - **Resources and Values**:\n     - I have high quantities of Sheep (value 18) and Ore (value 34), but lower quantities of Brick (value 30) and Wood (value 11).\n     - Wheat has the lowest value (6) and highest quantity (18), so it's the least useful to me.\n   - **Goal**: Increase total resource value, ideally by trading away low-value-per-unit resources (like Wheat) for higher-value ones (like Ore or Brick).\n\n2. **Evaluating Previous Offer**:\n   - The rejected offer was: Give 6 Sheep (6*18=108 total value) \u2192 Get 3 Brick (3*30=90) + 2 Wood (2*11=22) \u2192 total 112 value gained.\n   - Net gain: +4 value (112 - 108), but Player 1 rejected it. This suggests they either didn't value the trade fairly or might need different resources.\n\n3. **Rethinking My Strategy**:\n   - Since Sheep has a high intrinsic value (18), I might be overpaying. Maybe I should offer resources I'm more willing to give up (like Wheat or Ore, since Ore is valuable but I have a surplus).\n   - Brick and Wood are scarce for me (only 11 and 6 units), so they're good targets to acquire.\n\n4. **Identifying Needs**:\n   - I need more Brick and Wood, but my opponent rejected Sheep-heavy offers. Maybe they don\u2019t need Sheep, or the value wasn\u2019t right for them.\n   - I have a lot of Ore (23), which is high-value but maybe they need it? Or maybe Wheat can be a better \"sweetener\" due to low value to me.\n\n5. **New Offer Design**:\n   - Try offering fewer Sheep (since Player 1 might not need more) and more Wheat or Ore.\n   - For whisper trade value to myself:\n     Let me aim to get 2 Brick + 1 Wood (2*30 + 11 = 71).\n     To minimize my cost, I could offer 5 Wheat (5*6=30) + 2 Ore (2*34=68) \u2192 total 98 given, 71 taken. Net loss, bad.\n     Or 10 Wheat (10*6=60) \u2192 60 value given for 71 value. Better, but Player 1 might prefer Ore.\n   - Maybe a more balanced mix: 4 Ore (136) \u2192 3 Brick (90) + 2 Wood (22) = 112. Net loss for me (136-112=24), bad.\n   - Another approach: 2 Sheep (36) + 5 Wheat (30) \u2192 3 Brick (90) + 1 Wood (11) = 101. Net 101-66=+35 for me, but might be too good and rejected.\n\n6. **Revised Fair Offer**:\n   - Player 1 seems to undervalue Sheep. Try luring with Wheat and Ore:\n     Offer: 5 Wheat (30) + 1 Ore (34) \u2192 2 Brick (60) + 1 Wood (11) = 71.\n     Net gain: 71-64=+7 for me. Still acceptable and less greedy than my first offer.\n\n7. **Decision**:\n   - The last rejected offer was Sheep-centric. Let's pivot to Wheat as a giveaway while keeping Ore moderate, targeting Brick/Wood.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Ore \u2192 2 Brick, 1 Wood]",

Asset-by-asset analysis  \n   \u2022 Wheat \u2013 lowest marginal utility (6 per unit) and largest surplus; I am happy to ship it out.  \n   \u2022 Ore \u2013 high utility (34), but holding 23 units is excessive. If I turn 3-4 Ore into Brick (I have only 11 of the most-useful Brick), I could gain >100 value quickly.  \n   \u2022 Sheep \u2013 same story: 24 units of 18-value is a lot; reducing this pile by 5-8 is safe.  \n   \u2022 Wood \u2013 only 6 units, no willingness to lose any at all (value 11, lowest quantity).  \n   \u2022 Brick \u2013 extremely valuable (30), scarcest; any extra Brick dramatically raises my total value.\n\n3. Goal  \n   Convert excess Sheep and/or Ore into Brick and perhaps pick up extra Wood rather than giving Wood away.  \n   Try to keep the trade \u201cbalanced\u201d so Player 1 sees gain on their side as well.\n\n4. Proposal design  \n   Looking at end of previous logs, we just traded 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick + 1 Wood, cutting my Sheep to 21 and raising Brick to 13. That trade was +62 value for me (3\u00d718 \u2192 2\u00d730 + 1\u00d711 = 53 \u2013 54 \u2192 \u20131? Wait, no: I gave away 3 Sheep @18 = 54 value; received 2 Brick @30 = 60 + 1 Wood @11 = 11 \u2192 total 71; net change 71 \u2013 54 = **+17**).\n\n   We still sit on a large Ore/sizeable Sheep pile. A second bite is possible.\n\n   Proposed trade:  \n   - Give 3 Ore  (I drop from 20 to 17)  \n   - Receive 2 Brick + 1 Wood (gain 2 Brick, 1 Wood).\n\n   Value check for me: give up 3\u00d734 = 102, receive 2\u00d730 + 1\u00d711 = 71. Net **\u201331**? That\u2019s no good. So this direction is wrong.\n\n   Adjust.  \n   Brick is scarce for them too. Better move is to go back to Sheep as the payable asset.\n\n   Offer: 6 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick\n\n   My net change: \u2212108 + 90 = \u221218 looks bad. But my earlier 3 Sheep\u21922 Brick trade was exactly 2-for-1 conversion of Sheep\u2192Brick. Let\u2019s stick to that proven effective ratio and leave Wood out (I no longer want to give away any Wood).\n\n   Therefore simplify: offer **4 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick**.  \n   For me: give 4\u00d718 = 72, receive 2\u00d730 = 60; net value change **\u221212**. However Brick\u2019s margin of utility is so large (30 vs 18) that a 2:1 \u201cfrom Sheep\u201d ratio is historically what Player 1 accepted last turn. It remains our best realistic ask.\n\n5.

This might indicate that Player 0 doesn't have 5 Wood available or didn't see the value in giving it.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the values:\n- Giving up Ore (Value: 40) for Wood (Value: 10) isn't very efficient unless I get a lot of Wood.\n- Since my last offer of 2 Ore -> 5 Wood was rejected, I might need to reconsider the terms or think about other resources.\n\n**New Trade Idea**:\n- Considering my abundance of Sheep and the previous successful trade involving Sheep, I might offer Sheep again.\n- Player 0 previously offered Sheep for Brick and Wood, so they might be looking for Sheep or have Brick and Wood to spare.\n\nLet's think about making a new offer:\n- I have 27 Sheep now. Offering some Sheep could be viable if the request is reasonable.\n- For example, offering fewer Sheep than before but asking for a resource that's valuable to me could work.\n\n**Decision**:\nLet's make a new offer. I've got a good quantity of Sheep. How about offering 2 Sheep for 1 Ore? This is because Ore is very valuable (Value: 40), and gaining some Ore could significantly increase my total value.
