      "response": "My current resources are:\n- Wheat: 22 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 25 (Value: 11)\n- Sheep: 9 (Value: 15)\n- Brick: 6 (Value: 26)\n- Ore: 20 (Value: 37)\n\nTotal current value: (22 * 6) + (25 * 11) + (9 * 15) + (6 * 26) + (20 * 37) = 132 + 275 + 135 + 156 + 740 = 1438\n\nMy goal is to increase my total resource value. This means I want to trade resources I value less for resources I value more, or trade resources I have in abundance for resources I need.\n\nMy most valuable resource per unit is Ore (37), followed by Brick (26), Sheep (15), Wood (11), and Wheat (6).\n\nI have a good quantity of Wheat (22) and Wood (25), which are my least valuable resources. I also have a lot of Ore (20), which is my most valuable.\nI have the least amount of Brick (6) and Sheep (9).\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n\n1.  **High-value acquisition:** I want to acquire more Ore and Brick if possible, as they have the highest per-unit value.\n2.  **Offloading low-value/abundance:** I have plenty of Wheat and Wood. I should be willing to trade these for higher-value resources. I have a very high quantity of Ore, so I might consider trading some Ore if the return in other high-value resources (like Brick) is good, or if I can get a very good ratio for it.\n3.  **Opponent's perspective:** The opponent might also be looking to increase their value. They might have an abundance of high-value resources they are willing to trade for low-value resources they need, or vice-versa. They might also be low on Brick or Ore and might be willing to pay a premium.\n\n**Potential Trade Ideas:**\n\n*   **Trade Wheat/Wood for Brick/Ore/Sheep:** This aligns with my core strategy of increasing overall value by exchanging low-value items for high-value items.\n*   **Target specific missing resources:** I have relatively low quantities of Brick and Sheep.\n*   **Leverage high quantity of Ore:** I have 20 Ore. Could I trade 1 Ore (value 37) for 2 Brick (value 52) or 3 Sheep (value 45)? This would be a good trade in terms of value.\n\nLet's evaluate some specific trades from my side:\n\n*   **Offer 1: Trade Wheat for Brick/Ore**\n    *   Example: 5 Wheat (Value 30) for 1 Brick (Value 26). This is a bad trade for me.\n    *   Example: 6 Wheat (Value 36) for 1 Brick (Value 26). Still bad.\n    *   Example: 3 Wheat (Value 18) for 1 Sheep (Value 15). Bad.\n    *   This shows that Wheat's low value makes it hard to trade directly for higher-value items without offering a lot of quantity.\n\n*   **Offer 2: Trade Wood for Brick/Ore/Sheep**\n    *   Example: 3 Wood (Value 33) for 1 Brick (Value 26). Bad.\n    *   Example: 2 Wood (Value 22) for 1 Sheep (Value 15). Bad.\n    *   Wood is slightly better than Wheat but still hard to trade up.\n\n*   **Offer 3: Use my high-value resources to gain even more value (if the ratio is good)**\n    *   I have 20 Ore. What if I trade 1 Ore (value 37) for 2 Brick (value 52)? This is a great deal.\n    *   What if I trade 1 Ore (value 37) for 3 Sheep (value 45)? This is also a good deal.\n    *   What if I trade 1 Brick (value 26) for 2 Sheep (value 30)? This is a good deal.\n\nMy best strategy for the first turn is to make an offer that is clearly beneficial for me, but also potentially attractive to the opponent if they are trying to gain quantity or different resource types.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat and Wood. Let's try to offload some of them.\nLet's try to acquire Brick, as it is my second most valuable resource and I have few of them.\n\nIf I offer Wheat, I'd need to offer a lot. My goal is to increase my overall value, so I want to get more value than I give.\n\nConsider the ratio: 1 Wheat = 6. 1 Brick = 26.\nTo get 1 Brick, I'd need to offer more than 26 value in Wheat, or the opponent would be losing value.\nIf I offer 5 Wheat (value 30) for 1 Brick (value 26), I lose 4 value. Not good.\nI want to gain value. So I need to offer less value than I receive.\n\nLet's try: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]`\nValue offered: (3 * 6) + (2 * 11) = 18 + 22 = 40\nValue received: (1 * 26) + (1 * 15) = 26 + 15 = 41\nThis makes a gain of 1 value. It's small, but it moves my lower-value resources for higher-value ones, and gets me more Brick and Sheep, which I have less of. It's a plausible trade for Player 1 if they are short on Wheat or Wood or want to offload Brick/Sheep.\n\nLet's try a different combination, perhaps leveraging my abundance slightly more.\nWhat if I try to trade some higher-value quantity resources for fewer, but much higher value ones?\nI have 20 Ore. If I traded 1 Ore (value 37) for something, it would need to be very good.\nSay, 1 Ore (37) for 2 Brick (52). This is a big gain.\nOr 1 Ore (37) for 3 Sheep (45). Also a good gain.\n\nLet's start by trying to convert some of my highest quantity, lowest value items (Wheat, Wood) into high-value items (Brick, Ore, Sheep). Since my overall goal is to increase total value, focusing on the highest value items is key.\n\nMy most pressing need for increasing value is to get more Brick and Ore, as they provide the highest value per unit.\nI have a lot of Wheat (22) and Wood (25). Let's try to convert some of these.\n\nOffer: 4 Wood (Value: 4 * 11 = 44) for 1 Brick (Value: 26) and 1 Sheep (Value: 15). Total requested value: 41. I lose 3 value. Not good.\n\nI need to make an offer where the value of what I receive is *greater* than the value of what I offer.\n\nLet's reconsider. Maybe I should offer some Ore or Sheep to receive Brick or Ore, if the ratio is good.\nExample: I offer 1 Sheep (15) for 1 Wood (11) and 1 Wheat (6). Total requested 17. Good for me. (This is trading high for low - good move)\nExample: I offer 1 Ore (37) for 1 Brick (26) and 1 Sheep (15). Total requested 41. Good for me.\n\nThis seems like a good strategy: Offer a single higher-value item that I have in good quantity (Ore or Sheep) for multiple lower-value unique items. This nets me overall value, and diversifies my resource types, which could be useful later.\n\nLet's offer 1 Ore for something valuable.\nValue of 1 Ore = 37.\nI want to get resources with a combined value > 37.\nPossibility 1: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick (Value = 52). This is a great deal for me.\nPossibility 2: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep (Value = 26 + 15 = 41). Good deal.\nPossibility 3: 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep (Value = 45). Good deal.\n\nThe 1 Ore -> 2 Brick offer is the best by far in terms of value increase (+15 value). It's also simple and clear.\nThe opponent might not have 2 Brick to spare, or might value Brick highly.\n\nLet's try a slightly less aggressive, but still value-positive trade, that might be more appealing to the opponent.\nTrading 1 high-value item for a mix often works.\nMy current high quantities are Wheat (22), Wood (25), Ore (20).\n\nLet me try to trade from my most abundant category, Wood, for something I'm low on or high value.\nIf I give 2 Wood (22), what can I get?\nI could ask for 1 Brick (26). I gain 4 value. This is a very good deal for me. Is it plausible for opponent? They give 26 value to get 22 value. Unlikely.\n\nLet's go with the strategy of selling a high-value resource I have in abundance (Ore) for even more value in other high-value resources (Brick, Sheep).\n\nOffer: `[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]`\nMy gain: (1 Brick Value 26) + (1 Sheep Value 15) = 41\nMy loss: (1 Ore Value 37) = 37\nNet gain: 41 - 37 = +4 value. This maintains my Ore quantity at a healthy level (19 remaining) and increases my Brick and Sheep, which are relatively low quantities. It's a fair offer from my perspective and potentially good for the opponent if they are abundant in Ore and need Sheep/Brick.\n\nLet's evaluate the offer from the opponent's perspective. If they have a high quantity of Ore, they might be willing to trade one for two other unique resources. If they need Sheep or Brick, this could be a good trade for them even if they lose a little value in the strict sense (but they might gain utility or diversity).\n\nThis seems like a solid first move.\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]",

      "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning as Player 1\n\nBefore responding to Player 0's offer, I'll carefully analyze my situation, evaluate the trade, and consider key factors to ensure I make a decision that aligns with my goal: increasing the total value of my resources.\n\n1. **Understand my current situation and goals:**\n   - I currently have the following resources and their values:\n     - Wheat: 24 qty (value: 5 each) \u2192 Total value: 24 * 5 = 120\n     - Wood: 12 qty (value: 11 each) \u2192 Total value: 12 * 11 = 132\n     - Sheep: 5 qty (value: 16 each) \u2192 Total value: 5 * 16 = 80\n     - Brick: 16 qty (value: 29 each) \u2192 Total value: 16 * 29 = 464\n     - Ore: 25 qty (value: 37 each) \u2192 Total value: 25 * 37 = 925\n     - **Overall total value:** 120 + 132 + 80 + 464 + 925 = 2,621\n   - My primary goal is to make trades that increase this total value. I should only accept offers where the value of resources I receive exceeds the value of what I give up. The game has 10 turns, so I can afford to be selective and wait for better opportunities.\n   - I have abundant quantities of most resources (e.g., Wheat, Brick, and Ore), so I'm not desperate for anything right now. This gives me leverage in negotiations.\n\n2. **Evaluate the incoming offer:**\n   - Player 0's offer: They want to give me 3 Wheat and 2 Wood in exchange for 1 Brick and 1 Sheep.\n   - Value of resources I'd receive:\n     - 3 Wheat: 3 * 5 = 15 value\n     - 2 Wood: 2 * 11 = 22 value\n     - Total incoming value: 15 + 22 = 37\n   - Value of resources I'd give up:\n     - 1 Brick: 1 * 29 = 29 value\n     - 1 Sheep: 1 * 16 = 16 value\n     - Total outgoing value: 29 + 16 = 45\n   - Net value change: Incoming value (37) - Outgoing value (45) = -8 (a net loss of 8 value points).\n   - This trade would decrease my total resource value from 2,621 to 2,613, which directly contradicts my goal. Therefore, this offer is not beneficial.\n\n3. **Factors influencing my decision-making:**\n   - **Value disparity:** As calculated, I'm losing more value than I'm gaining. My resources like Brick and Sheep have higher individual values (29 and 16, respectively) compared to Wheat and Wood (5 and 11), so giving them up for less valuable items doesn't make sense.\n   - **Resource abundance and strategy:** I have 16 Brick and 5 Sheep, which are relatively plentiful, so I'm not in a position where I need to trade them away cheaply. On the other hand, Wheat and Wood are less valuable to me, and I already have a lot of Wheat (24 qty), so adding more doesn't help much.\n   - **Opportunity cost:** The game has 10 turns, and rejecting this allows me to potentially make a counteroffer or wait for a better deal. Accepting a loss now could set me back for future trades.\n   - **Risk and fairness:** There's no indication that this offer is part of a larger strategy or emergency, so I shouldn't feel pressured. I always prioritize trades where I come out ahead.\n\n4. **What might Player 0 be thinking or needing?**\n   - Player 0 is offering Wheat and Wood, which suggests they might have an excess of these and are trying to offload them. In contrast, they're requesting Brick and Sheep, which could mean they need these for their own goals (e.g., building projects that require them). Perhaps they undervalue my resources or are testing my willingness to trade. If they're desperate, I could use this to my advantage in a future counteroffer, but for now, their offer doesn't meet my value threshold.\n\nBased on this analysis, accepting the offer would harm my overall position. I'll deny it and consider making my own offer in a future turn if an opportunity arises.\n\n### My Decision\n[Deny]",

This means I want to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\nPlayer 1 rejected my previous offer. This indicates they either didn't see value in my offer or they didn't need what I was offering. My previous offer was: 3 Wheat (18) + 2 Wood (22) = 40 value for 1 Brick (26) + 1 Sheep (15) = 41 value. This was a relatively balanced trade trying to get 1 value profit, and convert lower value into higher value goods. Player 1 might have a different valuation or different needs.\n\nSince Player 1 didn't make a counter-offer, it's hard to gauge their needs directly. However, given their rejection, I should review my strategy.\n\nI have a large quantity of Wheat and Wood, which are my lowest value resources. Brick and Ore are my highest value resources. Sheep is in the middle. My aim is to convert low-value holdings into high-value ones.\n\nLet's consider what Player 1 might need. They might also want to upgrade their resources, or they might be looking for specific resources to complete a building or card set. Since I don't know their inventory, I have to make educated guesses.\n\nStrategy: Offer a trade that clearly benefits me in value, but is still appealing enough for Player 1.\nI have a lot of Ore and Wood, and a decent amount of Wheat. My Brick and Sheep quantities are lower.\n\nOption 1: Trade low for high resources.\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of low-value resources for a small amount of high-value resources?\nFor example, trading Wheat/Wood for Ore/Brick.\n\nLet's try to get more high-value resources like Ore or Brick.\nScenario: Offer some Wheat and Wood for Brick.\nWhat about 5 Wheat (30) + 3 Wood (33) = 63 value for 2 Brick (52)? This gives me a value loss of 11. This is not good for me.\n\nI need to make an offer that provides a good value gain for me.\nMy previous offer was \"3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep\". Total value offered was 40, requested was 41. Profit of 1. Player 1 rejected. Perhaps the profit was too small for them, or they didn't need Brick/Sheep, or perhaps they have a lot of Wheat/Wood as well and value them similarly low.\n\nLet's try to offer a more generous trade for Player 1, but still beneficial for me. Or, offer something that is very attractive if they value certain resources differently.\n\nConsider resources I have in abundance (Wheat, Wood) and resources I want more of (Brick, Ore).\nLet's try to get Ore, as it's the highest value resource.\nIf I offer 3 Wood (33) and 2 Wheat (12) = 45 value, for 1 Ore (37). I gain 1 Ore and lose cheaper resources. My value gain is 37 - 45 = -8. Not good.\n\nPerhaps I can offer a larger quantity of low-value resources for a single high-value resource. This might be attractive if Player 1 is low on specific resources.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick.\nTrade 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Brick (26). Value loss for me.\nTrade 3 Wood (33) for 1 Brick (26). Value loss for me.\n\nThe system values are: Wheat (6), Wood (11), Sheep (15), Brick (26), Ore (37).\nMy goal is to increase my value. So I want to give resources with low value per unit, and get resources with high value per unit.\nExample: Give 1 Wheat (6) get 1 Brick (26). Net +20. This is too good for me and likely to be rejected.\n\nI need to find a sweet spot where Player 1 sees enough benefit.\n\nLet's reconsider the ratio.\nMaybe I offer a good amount of low-value resources for a moderate amount of mid/high-value.\n\nHow about I try to swap quantity for quality?\nI have 22 Wheat and 25 Wood. I can spare some.\nI want more Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's try to sell off some Wheat.\nIf I offer 4 Wheat (24) for 1 Sheep (15), I lose value.\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (18) and 1 Wood (11) = 29 for 1 Brick (26). I lose value.\n\nI am Player 0. My goal is to maximize my value. The opponent must also seek to maximize their value.\nThe current offer gives me flexibility. I can try a different resource combination.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of low and mid-value resources for a high-value one?\nOffer: 2 Wood (22) + 1 Sheep (15) -> 1 Ore (37).\nValue offered = 37. Value requested = 37. This is a neutral trade in terms of total value.\nHowever, I convert Wood (11) and Sheep (15) into Ore (37). This is good because I reduce my quantity of mid-value resources and increase my quantity of highest-value resources. This improves my resource mix.\n\nLet's calculate the average value of resources I would be trading away vs. receiving:\nAverage value given: (22+15)/3 = 12.33\nAverage value received: 37/1 = 37\nThis seems like a good move for me. Will Player 1 accept it? It's a balanced value trade on paper, so if they need Wood or Sheep, or want to diversify, they might accept.\n\nLet's formalize that trade:\nOffer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore\n\nConsider the alternative:\nOffer: 5 Wheat (30) + 1 Wood (11) -> 1 Ore (37)\nValue offered: 41. Value requested: 37. I lose 4 value here. Not good.\n\nLet's stick with the 2 Wood, 1 Sheep for 1 Ore. It's value-neutral on paper but improves my resource concentration into higher value assets.\n\nFinal check of resources:\nCurrent:\nWheat: 22 @ 6\nWood: 25 @ 11\nSheep: 9 @ 15\nBrick: 6 @ 26\nOre: 20 @ 37\n\nAfter proposed trade (if accepted):\nWheat: 22\nWood: 23\nSheep: 8\nBrick: 6\nOre: 21\n\nTotal Value before: 1438\nTotal Value after: (22*6) + (23*11) + (8*15) + (6*26) + (21*37) = 132 + 253 + 120 + 156 + 777 = 1438.\nThe total value is indeed the same, but the spread of resources improves. This is a good strategic move to consolidate value into higher unit-value resources.\n\nOne more idea: trying to get Brick.\nOffer: 2 Wheat (12) + 1 Wood (11) -> 1 Brick (26).\nValue offered: 23. Value requested: 26.\nThis results in a gain of 3 for me. This is also a good trade for me, and Player 1 gets cheaper resources. This might be more appealing because it's slightly value-positive for me, and Player 1 gets more units for one unit if they are quantity-focused.\n\nLet's compare the two options for my offer:\n1. Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore (Value neutral, consolidate to higher value)\n   - I give up resources with individual values 11 and 15 for a resource with individual value 37.\n   - This seems like a strong play for me in terms of quality of resources.\n\n2. Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick (Value +3 for me, get more units)\n   - I give up resources with individual values 6 and 11 for a resource with individual value 26.\n   - This is explicitly value positive for me, which is good. Player 1 gets 3 resources for 1. If they need diverse resources or specific low-value ones, this could be good.\n\nI think the second option, 2 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Brick, offers a direct value gain for me. It's a small gain, but clear. Player 1 might see it as getting \"more\" items even if they are lower value. This is a common psychological aspect in trading.\n\nLet's quantify the gains on the second option:\nResources given: 2 Wheat (2*6=12) + 1 Wood (1*11=11) = 23 value.\nResources received: 1 Brick (1*26=26) = 26 value.\nNet gain for me = 3 value.\nI reduce my quantity of lowest-value resources (Wheat) and a mid-low value resource (Wood) for a higher middle-value resource (Brick). This seems good.\n\nThe risk is that Player 1 values Wheat and Wood very low, or they have a surplus of Brick. But my previous offer included Wheat and Wood, and they rejected it. Perhaps increasing the number of resources offered, even if low value, will make it more appealing, especially if they are trying to \"build\" something requiring many units.\n\nLet's go with the offer that guarantees me a value increase.\n\nMy existing resources:\nWheat: 22\nWood: 25\nSheep: 9\nBrick: 6\nOre: 20\n\nI will offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood\nI will request: 1 Brick\n\nValue offered: (2 * 6) + (1 * 11) = 12 + 11 = 23\nValue requested: (1 * 26) = 26\nNet value change for me: +3\n\nThis seems like a solid offer to try.\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nAs Player 1, my primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources through strategic trading. Let's break this down step by step based on the game state and the current offer from Player 0.\n\n1. **Current Situation and Goals**:\n   - I currently have: Wheat (24 qty, value 5 each), Wood (12 qty, value 11 each), Sheep (5 qty, value 16 each), Brick (16 qty, value 29 each), and Ore (25 qty, value 37 each).\n   - My total resource value is calculated as: (24 * 5) + (12 * 11) + (5 * 16) + (16 * 29) + (25 * 37) = 120 + 132 + 80 + 464 + 925 = 1721.\n   - I have an abundance of Wheat (24 qty) and Ore (25 qty), which are my lowest and highest value items, respectively. Brick is also high-value (29 each), so I should be cautious about trading it away unless I get more value in return.\n   - Goal: Any trade must result in a net increase in my total value (e.g., value received > value given). I have 10 turns total, so I need to be selective and push for favorable deals early.\n\n2. **Evaluating Potential Trades or Offers**:\n   - For Player 0's current offer: They are offering 2 Wheat (2 * 5 = 10 value) and 1 Wood (1 * 11 = 11 value), totaling 21 value, in exchange for 1 Brick (29 value) from me.\n   - Net value change: I would gain 21 value but lose 29 value, resulting in a net loss of 8 value. This does not meet my goal, so I should reject it.\n   - General evaluation criteria: I prioritize trades where the incoming resources' total value exceeds the outgoing resources' value. I should leverage my abundant, lower-value resources (like Wheat) or high-value ones (like Brick or Ore) only if it yields a profit. Factors like quantity limits (e.g., I only have 5 Sheep) also matter.\n\n3. **Factors Influencing Decision-Making**:\n   - **Resource Abundance and Scarcity**: I'm willing to trade excess Wheat or Wood, but Brick and Ore are premium, so I demand a significant value premium for them.\n   - **Opponent's Behavior**: Player 0 has twice offered Wheat and Wood in exchange for Brick (and previously Sheep). This suggests they need Brick badly and may have excess Wheat and Wood. I can exploit this by counter-offering a trade that demands more of their resources to make it worthwhile for me.\n   - **Risk and Game Turns**: Rejecting and counter-offering keeps the game moving, but I risk them rejecting my offer. With 10 turns, I can afford to be firm now and negotiate better terms.\n   - **Potential for Mutual Benefit**: While my goal is self-serving, proposing a counter-offer might encourage further negotiation. Player 0 might accept if they value Brick highly enough.\n\n4. **What Might the Opponent Be Thinking or Needing?**:\n   - Player 0 is repeatedly asking for Brick, so they likely need it for their strategy and are undervaluing their own resources in these offers. They might be low on Brick and willing to overpay in Wheat and Wood to get it. However, if I demand too much, they could walk away, so my counter-offer should be ambitious but not outrageous to keep dialogue open.\n\n5. **Final Decision**:\n   - First, I must deny Player 0's current offer since it's a net loss for me.\n   - Then, I'll make a counter-offer: Offer 1 Brick (29 value) in exchange for 4 Wheat and 2 Wood (4 * 5 = 20 value + 2 * 11 = 22 value = 42 total value). This gives me a net gain of 42 - 29 = 13 value, increasing my total to 1734 if accepted. It's a reasonable escalation from their offer, testing their desperation for Brick while protecting my interests.\n\n### Action\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 4 Wheat, 2 Wood]",

Accepting this offer directly contradicts that goal.\n    *   Therefore, I should reject this offer.\n\n4.  **Formulate My Own Offer (if rejecting):**\n    *   **Goal:** Increase total value. This means trying to trade low-value resources for high-value resources, or trading resources I have in abundance for resources I need (which usually aligns with higher value).\n    *   **My Resource Abundance/Scarcity:**\n        *   Wheat (22): Good quantity, lowest value. Prime candidate for trading away.\n        *   Wood (25): Good quantity, second lowest value. Also good for trading away.\n        *   Sheep (9): Moderate quantity, moderate value.\n        *   Brick (6): Lowest quantity, high value. I want *more* of this or to keep it.\n        *   Ore (20): High quantity, highest value. I want to keep this, or trade *very* opportunistically.\n    *   **Previous Offers and Rejections:**\n        *   My previous offers (3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep) and (2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick) were rejected. This indicates Player 1 might value Brick highly, or perceive my offer as not beneficial enough for them.\n        *   Player 1 just offered to exchange 1 Brick for 4 Wheat, 2 Wood. This further confirms they value Brick highly and are willing to give away Wheat/Wood.\n    *   **Strategy:** Player 1 wants to give Wheat/Wood and get Brick. I want to give Wheat/Wood and get Brick (or Ore, but Brick is more likely to be accepted). My strategy should be to get Brick by giving away Wheat and/or Wood, but at a more favorable rate for me.\n\n    *   Let's analyze value ratios:\n        *   1 Brick (26)\n        *   Wheat (6)\n        *   Wood (11)\n\n    *   To gain value, I need (Value of received) > (Value of given).\n    *   Previous offer from Player 1 was 1 Brick (26) for 4 Wheat (24) + 2 Wood (22) = 46. They wanted a net gain of 20.\n    *   I want a net gain. Can I get 1 Brick for fewer Wheat/Wood than they requested?\n    *   Target: 1 Brick (Value 26)\n    *   Possible combinations for me to offer (less than 26 value):\n        *   4 Wheat (24) is close, but still -2.\n        *   3 Wheat (18) + 1 Wood (11) = 29 (too much for *me* to give for 1 Brick)\n        *   2 Wheat (12) + 1 Wood (11) = 23 (Good for me, value gain of 3)\n        *   1 Wheat (6) + 2 Wood (22) = 28 (too much)\n\n    *   My last rejected offer was 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick. Value: 23 -> 26. This was a +3 for me, but rejected.\n    *   Player 1 just offered 1 Brick for 4 Wheat, 2 Wood. They clearly want to extract more value for their Brick than I'm offering.\n\n    *   What if I try to get something *else* from them? Maybe they have another resource they value less?\n    *   *Self-correction:* Player 1's behavior indicates they *want* to get rid of Wheat/Wood, and *get* Brick. It might be better to lean into this and modify my previous offer slightly to be more appealing *to them*, while still being profitable for me.\n\n    *   Let's re-evaluate 1 Brick for Wheat/Wood.\n        *   If I offer (say) 3 Wheat (18) + Some Wood...\n        *   If I offer (say) 2 Wheat (12) + Some Wood...\n\n    *   Consider making an offer that is *slightly* less favorable for me than my ideal, but still profitable, and more appealing for them than their rejected offer.\n        *   My rejected offer: 2 Wheat (12), 1 Wood (11) = 23. Request: 1 Brick (26). (+3 for me)\n        *   Their rejected offer: 1 Brick (26). Request: 4 Wheat (24), 2 Wood (22) = 46. (+20 for them)\n\n    *   There's a significant gap. Player 1 is asking for 46 value for 26 value. I was asking for 23 value for 26 value.\n    *   Player 1 has a lot of Wheat (18) and Wood (15) as per the initial state. My quantities are similar.\n    *   Let's try to meet them a *little* bit. What if I offer slightly more Wheat/Wood, but still less than 1 Brick's value?\n    *   If I offer 3 Wheat (18) for 1 Brick (26). Value gain: 8. This is good for me. Is it too low for Player 1? Probably, given they just wanted 4 Wheat + 2 Wood.\n    *   How about 4 Wheat (24) for 1 Brick (26)? Gain of 2 for me. This is very close to breaking even for me. It's a small gain, but better than a loss. Player 1 offered (4W, 2W) for 1B, which is much more than 4W. So 4W by itself is unlikely.\n    *   I need to consider what Player 1 might accept. They've been rejecting my offers for Brick at low cost and asking for high cost.\n    *   What about other resources? Maybe Sheep for Brick? 1 Sheep (15) for 1 Brick (26)? Value gain 11. But I only have 9 Sheep and have more Wheat/Wood. I want to shed low value, not necessarily high value.\n\n    *   Given Player 1 just wanted a lot of Wheat and Wood for 1 Brick, they likely value their Brick highly and are trying to get rid of their low-value resources.\n    *   I will try to make an offer that shifts more of my low-value assets (Wheat, Wood) for a high-value asset (Brick), but at a rate that is still profitable me.\n    *   Let's try 3 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Brick.\n        *   Value offered: 3 * 6 (Wheat) + 1 * 11 (Wood) = 18 + 11 = 29\n        *   Value received: 1 * 26 (Brick) = 26\n        *   Net change for me: 26 - 29 = -3. This is a *loss*. Not good.\n\n    *   This is tricky. Player 1 is being greedy. I need to make a profitable offer.\n    *   Let's stick to the previous acceptable zone. Player 1 has Wheat and Wood to give, so they are not starving for them. They have Brick they value highly.\n    *   My best bet is still to acquire Brick.\n    *   What if I try for a lower *quantity* of desired resource, or a lower *value* desired resource?\n    *   What if I try for Sheep instead of Brick? My current sheep are 9 (value 15 each).\n    *   Offer: 2 Wheat (12) + 1 Wood (11) = 23\n    *   Request: 1 Sheep (15) OR 1 Brick (26).\n    *   If I request 1 Sheep, I get 15 value for 23 value. (-8 for me). Bad.\n\n    *   The only way to make a profitable trade for me *if Player 1 wants a lot of low-value resources for their high-value resources* is to offer very little of my low-value resources for their high-value resources.\n    *   My last offer of (2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick) was +3 for me and rejected.\n    *   Player 1 asking for (4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick) was +20 for them and rejected by me.\n    *   The gap is huge.\n\n    *   I need to try another high-value target. What about Ore? I have 20 Ore (Value 37). I don't want to get rid of it.\n    *   I have plenty of Wood and Wheat.\n\n    *   Let's try to iterate on my previous offer. Player 1 is effectively asking for more from me for their Brick. I want to pay less.\n    *   I will stick to trying to get Brick. It's high value and I have low quantity.\n    *   I will offer similar low value combinations as before, just tweaking. I have a lot of low value resources currently.\n    *   What if I offer a significant chunk of Wheat for something like Brick or even Ore.\n    *   Offer: 5 Wheat (30) -> 1 Brick (26)? Loss.\n    *   Offer: 6 Wheat (36) -> 1 Ore (37)? Small gain (1). Might be acceptable to Player 1 if they have excess high-value Ore and want to offload it for low-value Wheat.\n    *   This is a strong candidate for an offer. I shed a low-value resource (Wheat) for a high-value resource (Ore), gaining 1 unit of value. Player 1, if they have excess Ore and want Wheat, might accept. It's a relatively \"fair\" trade in terms of total underlying value exchange.\n\n    *   Let's re-confirm my quantities:\n        *   Wheat: 22\n        *   Wood: 25\n        *   Sheep: 9\n        *   Brick: 6\n        *   Ore: 20\n\n    *   I have enough Wheat to make this offer.\n    *   This avoids the stalemate over Brick where Player 1 wants too much.\n\n    *   Final check on 6 Wheat for 1 Ore:\n        *   Give: 6 Wheat @ 6 = 36\n        *   Receive: 1 Ore @ 37 = 37\n        *   Net change: +1. It's a gain, albeit small. It's better than losing value or not trading.\n\nThis is a reasonable strategy given the strong rejections from Player 1 on my initial Brick offers and their extremely aggressive counter-offer for Brick. It attempts to open up a new trade avenue that is profitable for me and might be perceived as acceptable or slightly profitable for Player 1 if they have excess Ore or a need for high quantities of low-value resources.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"Offer\",\n  \"offered_items\": {\n    \"Wheat\": 6\n  },\n  \"requested_items\": {\n    \"Ore\": 1\n  }\n}\n```",

      "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning as Player 1\n\nBefore making a decision, I'll carefully analyze my situation, evaluate potential trades, and consider the broader context, as per the game instructions.\n\n1. **Current Situation and Goals:**\n   - I currently hold: Wheat (24 qty, value 5 each), Wood (12 qty, value 11 each), Sheep (5 qty, value 16 each), Brick (16 qty, value 29 each), and Ore (25 qty, value 37 each).\n   - My total resource value is calculated as: (24 * 5) + (12 * 11) + (5 * 16) + (16 * 29) + (25 * 37) = 120 + 132 + 80 + 464 + 925 = **1721**.\n   - Goal: Increase my total value through trades. This means any trade I make must result in the value of resources I receive being greater than the value of resources I offer.\n   - I have an abundance of Wheat, Wood, Brick, and Ore, but Sheep is relatively scarce (only 5 qty). I should prioritize trading excess resources like Brick (which I have 16 of) for resources that provide a net value gain.\n\n2. **Evaluating Potential Trades or Offers:**\n   - For any trade, I'll calculate the net value change: Value of received resources minus value of offered resources. I only proceed if this is positive.\n   - Factors for evaluation:\n     - Resource values: Higher-value resources (e.g., Ore at 37) are priorities to acquire or protect, while lower-value ones (e.g., Wheat at 5) are easier to trade away.\n     - My quantities: I can afford to trade Wheat, Wood, or Brick without depleting them, but I should be cautious with Sheep and Ore.\n     - Opportunity cost: Trading away a resource like Brick (value 29) should yield at least slightly more value in return to justify the loss.\n   - From the game history, Player 0 has offered Wheat and Wood multiple times, suggesting they have an excess of these and need Brick or Sheep. They rejected my previous offer (1 Brick for 4 Wheat + 2 Wood), which had a net value gain for me (offered 29, wanted 42), so they might value their resources differently or lack the quantities.\n\n3. **Factors Influencing Decision-Making:**\n   - Game progression: The game has 10 turns, and several exchanges have already occurred. I need to be proactive but not desperate, as turns are limited.\n   - Opponent's behavior: Player 0 is interested in Brick (as seen in their offers) and possibly Sheep, but they have plenty of Wheat and Wood. My previous offer was reasonable for me (net gain), but they rejected it, so I might need to adjust slightly to make it more appealing while still ensuring a net gain for me.\n   - Risk: If I don't make an offer, I miss a chance to increase value. However, I won't accept less than a net positive trade.\n   - Balance: I should avoid over-trading high-value resources like Ore or Sheep unless the return is exceptional.\n\n4. **What Might the Opponent Be Thinking or Needing?**\n   - Player 0 has consistently offered Wheat and Wood, indicating these are their surplus resources. They've targeted Brick (and once Sheep), so they likely need these for their strategy.\n   - They rejected my offer of 1 Brick for 4 Wheat + 2 Wood (which was a good deal for me), possibly because:\n     - They don't have enough Wheat and Wood to trade.\n     - They value their resources higher than I do.\n     - They're holding out for a better deal, like more Brick or something else.\n   - I can use this to my advantage by proposing another trade involving Brick (my excess) for more of their Wheat and Wood, but I'll tweak it to ensure it's still a net gain for me.\n\n5. **Final Decision-Making:**\n   - Based on the above, I should make a new offer to continue negotiating. I'll focus on trading 1 Brick (value 29) for a combination of Wheat and Wood that exceeds 29 in value.\n   - Proposed trade: Offer 1 Brick for 5 Wheat and 2 Wood.\n     - Value calculation: Offering 1 Brick = 29.\n     - Wanted: 5 Wheat = 5 * 5 = 25, plus 2 Wood = 2 * 11 = 22, total wanted = 47.\n     - Net value change: 47 - 29 = +18 (a gain, so this aligns with my goal).\n   - This is an adjusted version of my previous offer (which was 4 Wheat + 2 Wood for 1 Brick), slightly increasing what I ask for to test if Player 0 will bite, while still being fair and beneficial to me.\n   - If this doesn't work, I can refine further in future turns.\n\n### Action\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 5 Wheat, 2 Wood]",

This generally means trading lower-value resources for higher-value resources.\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is: \"Offered items: 1 Brick -> Requested items: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood\"\n\nLet's evaluate this trade:\n- Player 1 offers: 1 Brick (Value: 26)\n- Player 1 requests from me: 5 Wheat (Value: 5 * 6 = 30) + 2 Wood (Value: 2 * 11 = 22) = 52\n\nIf I accept this trade:\n- I lose: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood (Total value loss: 52)\n- I gain: 1 Brick (Total value gain: 26)\n\nThis trade results in a net loss of 52 - 26 = 26 in value for me. This is a very bad trade for me.\n\nMy previous offers (which were rejected) were:\n1. 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep (My offer: 3*6 + 2*11 = 18 + 22 = 40. P1's requested from me: 1*26 + 1*15 = 41. Fairly balanced, slightly in my favor if accepted). This was rejected.\n2. 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick (My offer: 2*6 + 1*11 = 12 + 11 = 23. P1's requested from me: 1*26. This was trying to get a Brick for less than its value, so I asked for a gain for myself. This was rejected.)\n\nPlayer 1 seem to be valuing Brick highly, and potentially Wheat and Wood lowly.\nThe last offer from Player 1 (1 Brick -> 5 Wheat, 2 Wood) suggests they are trying to get a lot of low-value resources for their Brick. Player 1's previous offer was 1 Brick -> 4 Wheat, 2 Wood (my loss 4*6 + 2*11 = 24+22=46, gain 26, net loss 20). Now it's even worse for me.\n\nI should continue to try to trade my lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for higher-value resources (Brick, Ore, Sheep). Since Player 1 seems to want Wheat and Wood, I could try to offer them for something more valuable. However, they are asking for too much.\n\nStrategy:\n1. Deny the current unfavorable offer from Player 1.\n2. Formulate a new offer that is beneficial to me, focusing on trading low-value resources for high-value resources.\n3. Given Player 1's previous offers and rejections, they seem to be looking for Wheat and Wood. I have plenty of both.\n4. I have 22 Wheat and 25 Wood. I can afford to part with some.\n5. I want more Brick, Sheep or Ore. Brick is 26, Sheep 15, Ore 37.\n\nLet's try to get a Sheep (value 15) for some Wheat and Wood.\nWhat about 1 Wood (11)? Plus some Wheat.\nMaybe 1 Wood (11) and 1 Wheat (6) = 17 for 1 Sheep (15). This is beneficial to me.\nOr, perhaps I can offer 2 Wood (22) for 1 Brick (26). This is a good deal for me. Player 1 seems to want a lot of wood. 2 Wood is less than 1 Brick value.\n\nLet's consider what Player 1 rejected when I offered 2 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Brick. That was 23 for 26.\nPlayer 1 offered 1 Brick for 4 Wheat, 2 Wood. That was 26 for 46.\nThey want a significant gain from their Brick.\n\nI need to make an offer that is attractive to Player 1, but still beneficial to me.\nPerhaps I can offer a larger quantity of wheat/wood for a relatively smaller gain in value.\nMy current value is 1438. I want to increase this.\n\nTo get 1 Brick (26), I am willing to pay up to 25 value in my resources.\nSo if I offer, say, 3 Wood (3*11=33) for 1 Brick (26), that's a loss. Not good.\nHow about 4 Wheat (4*6=24)? That is close to 1 Brick (26) in value. This would be a good trade for me, gaining 2 value. But Player 1 probably won't accept 4 Wheat when they want 5 Wheat and 2 Wood.\n\nLet's try to aim for a smaller but easier to obtain resource like Sheep.\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (18) for 1 Sheep (15). This is a loss for me.\nIf I offer 1 Wood (11) for 1 Sheep (15). This is a gain for me, but P1 might refuse. Player 1 knows Wood is valuable.\n\nLet's try to get 1 Brick, since Player 1 keeps offering it.\nWhat could I offer for 1 Brick (26) that is slightly less than 26 in value but could be attractive to Player 1 based on their need for Wheat/Wood?\n2 Wood (22) and 1 Wheat (6) = 28. This is a loss for me.\n3 Wood (33) for 1 Brick (26) is a loss of 7 for me.\n\nI have a large quantity of Wheat and Wood. Maybe I can trade quantity for quality.\nLet\u2019s re-evaluate the target. Maybe a Sheep is easier to acquire.\nI have plenty of Wood and Wheat.\nValue of Sheep = 15.\nI could offer 2 Wood (22) for 1 Sheep (15). This is a loss for me.\nI could offer 2 Wheat (12) for 1 Sheep (15). This is a gain for me (3 value). This might be acceptable if Player 1 really values Wheat.\nLet's try to offer 2 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Sheep. My value: 2*6 + 1*11 = 12 + 11 = 23. Requested value: 15. This is a loss for me of 8 value. Not good.\n\nI need to make an offer that results in a net gain for me, or at least a minimal loss if I need to offload low-value resources.\nGiven Player 1's request of 5 Wheat and 2 Wood for 1 Brick (value 52 for 26), they are trying to extract a lot of value.\n\nLet's try for a small gain for me.\nMy cheapest resources are Wheat (6) and Wood (11).\nMy most expensive resources are Ore (37) and Brick (26).\n\nI need to get rid of low value resources.\nLet's make an offer to gain a Brick.\nPlayer 1 asked for 5 Wheat, 2 Wood for 1 Brick (value 52 for 26).\nPlayer 1 previously asked for 4 Wheat, 2 Wood for 1 Brick (value 46 for 26)\n\nWhat if I offer 3 Wood (33) for 1 Brick (26) and 1 Wheat (6)? My offer 33, my request from P1: 26+6 = 32. This is a small loss (1 value) but gets rid of Wood.\n\nHow about I offer something to reduce my Wheat and Wood and get a Brick.\nWhat if I offer Player 1: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick.\nMy offer: 3*6 + 1*11 = 18 + 11 = 29.\nP1's offer: 1 Brick = 26.\nMy loss: 3 value. This is a small loss, but it converts low-value resources to a higher-value one, and reduces my stock of abundant resources. I have plenty of Wheat and Wood. This is a viable option if I want to just reduce inventory of low value items for a small loss.\n\nLet's try to target getting Ore.\nValue of Ore = 37.\nI could offer 3 Wood (33) and 1 Wheat (6) = 39 for 1 Ore (37). This is a loss of 2.\nOr 4 Wood (44) for 1 Ore (37) and 1 Wheat (6)? P1's loss (44), my gain (37+6=43). This is a loss of 1 for P1, good for me.\n\nPlayer 1 seems reluctant to accept my offers where I gain. I must make an offer that seems good to them, but still offers a slight advantage or breaks even for me.\n\nLet's consider the last offer from Player 1: 1 Brick -> 5 Wheat, 2 Wood (P1 offers 26, wants 52 from me). This highlights Player 1's strong need for Wheat and Wood and high valuation of Brick.\n\nI will formulate an offer that is less disadvantageous than P1's offer, and aims to get a Brick by giving up Wheat and Wood.\nWhat if I offer an amount of Wheat and Wood that is equal or slightly less than the value of Brick, but is composed of more units?\n2 Wood (22) for 1 Brick (26). This is a gain of 4 for me. Player 1 previously rejected 2 Wheat, 1 Wood (23) for 1 Brick (26), so 2 Wood (22) is less. Unlikely to be accepted.\n\nMy optimal strategy: Deny bad offers. Make slightly favorable offers to me. Re-evaluate after each turn.\nPlayer 1's current offer is very bad (net loss of 26 value). I must deny.\n\nNow, I need to make an offer.\nI have 22 Wheat and 25 Wood. I have plenty of these.\nI have 9 Sheep and 6 Brick. I want more of these, or Ore.\n\nI'll try to tempt Player 1 with a larger quantity of their desired resource (Wheat/Wood) for one of my desired resources (Brick/Sheep/Ore), but at a more balanced value exchange.\n\nLet's try to get 1 Brick (Value 26).\nWhat can I offer that is slightly over 26 in value, but mostly low-value items (Wheat/Wood), to give P1 a value gain?\nIf I offer 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Brick (26). This is a loss of 4 for me. Player 1 gains 4 value. This might be acceptable to P1 as it's just Wheat.\nI have 22 Wheat, so I can spare 5.\n\nIf I offer 3 Wood (33) for 1 Brick (26). This is a loss of 7 for me. Bad.\n\nLet's consider offering 3 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick.\nMy offer: (3*11) + (1*6) = 33 + 6 = 39.\nP1 offers: 1 Brick = 26.\nThis is a loss of 13 for me. Too much.\n\nWhat if I aim for a neutral or slightly positive exchange for me?\nOffer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Sheep\nMy offer: 2*11 + 1*6 = 22 + 6 = 28.\nP1 offers: 1 Sheep = 15.\nThis is a loss of 13 for me. Bad.\n\nWhat about trying to get 1 Ore (Value 37)?\nTo get 1 Ore (37), I could offer:\n- 4 Wood (44): Loss of 7.\n- 5 Wheat (30) and 1 Wood (11) = 41. Loss of 4.\n- 6 Wheat (36) and 1 Wood (11) = 47. Loss of 10.\n\nI need to be very careful not to lose value. Player 1's prior offers suggest they are aggressive in seeking value.\nI will deny Player 1's current offer. It is a terrible trade for me.\nThen I will make a counter-offer that is very slightly in my favour (or at worst breaks even) and takes into account Player 1's apparent desire for Wheat and Wood.\n\nI have 22 Wheat and 25 Wood.\nI want to clear my inventory of these low-value goods, but not at a huge loss.\nI will propose to exchange 4 Wheat and 1 Wood for 1 Brick.\nMy offer: 4 Wheat (4 * 6 = 24) + 1 Wood (1 * 11 = 11) = 35 value.\nP1 offers: 1 Brick (1 * 26 = 26 value).\n\nThis is still a net loss of 9 for me (35-26=9). This is me being too generous to try to get a deal through.\nI will try to make one that is a net gain for me to follow my rule strictly.\nWhat about 3 Wheat (18) and 1 Wood (11) for 1 Brick (26)?\nMy offer: 18 + 11 = 29.\nP1 offers: 1 Brick = 26.\nThis is a loss of 3 for me. Player 1 rejected 2 Wheat, 1 Wood (23) for 1 Brick (26) previously. The current offer is closer to what P1 wants.\n\nThe optimal strategy should focus on *increasing* total value. A net loss, even if small, moves me away from my goal.\nI need to reverse the value flow.\nLet's try to get a higher value resource for less.\nWhat if I offer 1 Wood (11) for 1 Sheep (15)? This is a gain of 4.\nIt's a low-unit offer that could be tempting. Player 1 might need Wood.\n\nLet's stick to the principle of only increasing my value.\nI will reject Player 1's current offer.\n\nThen, I will offer something that gains me value.\n- Trade Wood for Sheep: 1 Wood (11) for 1 Sheep (15). Net gain of 4 value.\n- Trade Wheat for Sheep: 2 Wheat (12) for 1 Sheep (15). Net gain of 3 value.\nThese are relatively small amounts of resources, which might make it easier for Player 1 to accept compared to multi-resource offers.\n\nI have 25 Wood, 22 Wheat, so I can easily afford these.\nI will try a smaller offer that directly benefits me.\nI will offer 1 Wood for 1 Sheep. This is a clear gain of 4 in value for me.\n\nStep-by-step thinking:\n1. Current offer from Player 1: 1 Brick -> 5 Wheat, 2 Wood. Value of P1 offer: 26. Value of P1 request: 5*6 + 2*11 = 30 + 22 = 52. This is a loss of 26 for me. I must [Deny].\n2. My goal is to increase my total resource value. This means trading away lower value resources for higher value resources, or trading quantities of low value for fewer quantities of high value without losing value.\n3. My resources: Wheat (6), Wood (11), Sheep (15), Brick (26), Ore (37).\n4. Player 1 has shown interest in Wheat and Wood (as evidenced by their requests).\n5. I would like to gain Sheep, Brick or Ore.\n6. Let's make an offer where I gain value.\n   - Offer: 1 Wood (Value 11)\n   - Request: 1 Sheep (Value 15)\n   - Net change for me: +4 in value.\n   - This seems like a reasonable offer for Player 1 if they need Wood and have surplus Sheep. It's only 1 unit of resource.\n\nIf Player 1 doesn't accept, I can always escalate the offer next turn (e.g., add some Wheat if necessary, but only if it results in a net gain for me).\nThe game lasts 10 turns, so I have time. I shouldn't rush into bad deals.\n\nMy decision:\n- Deny Player 1's current offer.\n- Make a new offer that guarantees a value increase for me.\n\nThe offer: [Offer: 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep]\n\nValue calculation for my offer:\n- Resources I give: 1 Wood (value 11)\n- Resources I want: 1 Sheep (value 15)\n- Net value change for me: +4 (15 - 11)\n\nThis is a clear short-term gain for me, and also helps consolidate my resources into more valuable types.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"Deny\"\n}\n```\nI have already decided to deny the offer.

      "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Current Situation and Goals**: I'm Player 1, and my objective is to increase the total value of my resources through trades. My current resources are:\n   - Wheat: 24 qty (value 5 each)\n   - Wood: 12 qty (value 11 each)\n   - Sheep: 5 qty (value 16 each)\n   - Brick: 16 qty (value 29 each)\n   - Ore: 25 qty (value 37 each)\n   From the game history, Player 0 has made several offers, and I've rejected them because they didn't benefit me. Now, Player 0 has offered 1 Wood (value 11) in exchange for 1 Sheep (value 16). This is the offer I need to evaluate first.\n\n2. **Evaluating the Offer**: To decide on Player 0's offer, I calculate the net value change:\n   - What I'm receiving: 1 Wood (value 11)\n   - What I'm giving: 1 Sheep (value 16)\n   - Net value change: 11 - 16 = -5 (a loss in total value)\n   Since my goal is to only make trades that increase my total value, this offer is not beneficial and should be rejected.\n\n3. **Factors Influencing Decision-Making**: \n   - **Value Comparison**: I always prioritize trades where the value of resources I receive exceeds the value I give. Player 0's offer gives me less value, so it's a clear rejection.\n   - **Resource Abundance**: I have plenty of Sheep (5 qty), so giving one away isn't a problem if I get fair value in return. However, Wood has a lower value per unit (11) compared to Sheep (16), making this trade unfavorable.\n   - **Opponent's Behavior**: Player 0 has repeatedly tried to acquire Sheep (in their first and current offers) and has offered Wheat and Wood in previous trades. This suggests they might need Sheep badly and have excess Wheat or Wood. I can use this to my advantage by proposing a counteroffer that exploits their interest while ensuring I gain value.\n   - **Game Context**: The game has 10 turns, and several have passed. I need to be proactive but strategic, proposing offers that are likely to be accepted to maximize my gains before turns run out.\n\n4. **What Might Opponent Be Thinking?**: Player 0 seems desperate for Sheep, as they've offered for it multiple times. They might undervalue my Sheep or overestimate the appeal of their Wood. By rejecting and countering with a better deal, I can test their willingness to trade more favorably.\n\n5. **Decision on Next Steps**: I'll deny the current offer since it's a net loss. Then, I'll make a new offer to capitalize on Player 0's interest in Sheep. A good counteroffer could be trading 1 Sheep (value 16) for 2 Wood (value 11 each, total 22), as this gives me a net gain of 22 - 16 = +6 in value. This is a reasonable escalation from their offer and might be acceptable to them.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood]",

This means I should aim to trade lower-value resources for higher-value resources.\n\nReceived offer from Player 1: Offered items: 1 Sheep -> Requested items: 2 Wood.\n\nLet's evaluate this offer:\n- Offered: 1 Sheep (Value: 15)\n- Requested: 2 Wood (Value: 2 * 11 = 22)\n\nIf I accept this trade, I would lose 2 Wood (value 22) and gain 1 Sheep (value 15). This would result in a net loss of 7 value (15 - 22 = -7). This trade does not increase my total value, so I should reject it.\n\nPlayer 1 seems to be interested in Wood. They have offered Brick for Wheat and Wood twice before, and also offered 1 Sheep for 2 Wood. Given their past offers, they might be resource-poor in Wood and potentially trying to acquire it or use Sheep to get it.\n\nI have a large quantity of Wood (25). While its value is decent, I could consider trading it for higher-value resources like Brick or Ore, or even Sheep if the exchange rate is favorable for me. I also have a lot of Wheat.\n\nMy earlier offers (3W, 2W -> 1B, 1S; 2W, 1W -> 1B) were rejected. Player 1 also rejected my offer of 1 Wood for 1 Sheep. This suggests they value their Sheep highly or my offer for it was too low for them.\n\nSince Player 1 just offered `1 Sheep -> 2 Wood`, they might be looking for Wood specifically.\nI have a lot of Wood. I have a fair amount of Brick. I have a lot of Ore. Sheep is mid-value.\n\nI want to trade resources with lower value for resources with higher value.\nWood (11) < Sheep (15) < Brick (26) < Ore (37)\nWheat (6) is my lowest value resource.\n\nI prefer to get Brick or Ore. I have plenty of Wheat and Wood.\n\nConsider making an offer:\nPlayer 1 offered 1 Sheep for 2 Wood. This shows they value Wood more than I do in this transaction or they are in urgent need of Wood.\nI currently have 9 Sheep and 25 Wood. I'm okay with trading Wood.\n\nWhat if I offer something that is beneficial for me, but still reasonable for them based on their past offers?\nPlayer 1 offered 1 Brick for 4 Wheat, 2 Wood (rejected by me because I already have a lot of Wheat and Wood and felt the offer was not good enough for 1 Brick).\nPlayer 1 also offered 1 Brick for 5 Wheat, 2 Wood (rejected by me for similar reasons).\n\nThis suggests Player 1 has Brick and wants Wheat and Wood.\nI have plenty of Wheat and Wood. I want Brick.\nLet's try to get Brick for Wheat and Wood, but with a better ratio for me.\nMy previous offer `2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick` was rejected. This had a value of (2*6 + 1*11 = 23) for 1 Brick (26). It was a good deal for me.\n\nPlayer 1 offered `1 Sheep -> 2 Wood`. This means they want Wood. They value Sheep at 15 and want 22 worth of Wood. They want 7 more value from me.\nThis indicates they might be desperate for Wood or think their Sheep is worth more.\n\nLet's try to trade my lowest value resource (Wheat) for something higher value.\nI have 22 Wheat. This is a large quantity. I should try to reduce it.\n\nWhat about trading Wheat and Wood for Brick?\nOr what about trading Wheat and Wood for Sheep?\nSince Player 1 previously offered Brick for Wheat and Wood, they might have Brick.\n\nHow about I offer something to reduce my Wheat holdings, in exchange for a higher value resource?\nIf I offer a lot of Wheat and a little Wood for one Brick, it might appeal to them.\nMy previous success with Brick for Wheat and Wood was:\nPlayer 0 offered 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick (Value: 23 -> 26). This was rejected.\n\nLet's consider what Player 1 might accept, given their past offers.\nThey offered (4W, 2W -> 1B) or (5W, 2W -> 1B). This implies they want a lot of Wheat and some Wood for 1 Brick.\nI have 22 Wheat and 25 Wood. I can spare those.\n\nLet's propose an offer that is slightly worse for me than my ideal, but better than what Player 1 proposed, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.\nMy previous best offer was `2 Wheat, 1 Wood` for 1 Brick (23 value for 26 value). Rejected.\nPlayer 1 offered `4 Wheat, 2 Wood` for 1 Brick (4*6 + 2*11 = 24 + 22 = 46 value for 26 value). Rejected by me.\nPlayer 1 offered `5 Wheat, 2 Wood` for 1 Brick (5*6 + 2*11 = 30 + 22 = 52 value for 26 value). Rejected by me.\n\nThe gap in valuing Brick is huge. They want significantly more value for 1 Brick than I am willing to give.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the current offer from Player 1: `1 Sheep -> 2 Wood`.\nI have 9 Sheep (Value 15) and 25 Wood (Value 11).\nTrading 2 Wood (Value 22) for 1 Sheep (Value 15) is a loss of 7 Value. I will deny this.\n\nWhat if I counter their offer for Wood? They seem to want Wood.\nI have 25 Wood. I can definitely spare some.\nWhat if I offer 1 Wood for 1 Wheat? (11 -> 6, bad for me)\nWhat if I offer 1 Wood for 1 Sheep? (11 -> 15, good for me, but they rejected this before)\nWhat if I offer 2 Wood for 1 Sheep? (22 -> 15, bad for me) No, this is what they offered.\n\nI have an excess of Wood. I want to convert low-value items into high-value items where possible.\nMy lowest value per item is Wheat (6). My highest is Ore (37).\nI have 22 Wheat, 25 Wood. I have 6 Brick, 20 Ore.\n\nLet's try to get Brick or Ore. I am very rich in Ore, but I want to keep it because it's valuable.\nHowever, if I can exchange some Ore for an even better deal, I would consider it. For example, 1 Ore for 2 Brick. (37 -> 52, good, but unlikely).\n\nLet's go back to the idea of trading low value for high value, and leveraging my excess in Wheat and Wood.\nPlayer 1 wants Wood.\nI have a lot of Wood. I have a lot of Wheat.\nI need Brick or Sheep. Brick has a value of 26. Sheep has a value of 15.\n\nWhat if I try to get a Sheep from them again, but with a different ratio?\nPreviously I offered 1 Wood for 1 Sheep (11 for 15, good for me, but denied).\n\nGiven that Player 1 offered `1 Sheep -> 2 Wood`, they clearly value Sheep very highly, or Wood very badly.\nI have 9 Sheep. Maybe I can trade a Sheep for some other resource that's good for me.\nThe goal is to increase total value.\n\nCould I offer a small amount of Wood and Wheat for a Sheep?\nSay, `2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep`?\nValue offered: (2*6) + 11 = 12 + 11 = 23.\nValue received: 15. This is a loss of value for me. Bad trade.\n\nOk, let's think about offers that are clearly profitable for me.\nMy resources ordered by value: Wheat (6), Wood (11), Sheep (15), Brick (26), Ore (37).\n\nPossible trades that increase my value:\n- Offer X Wheat for Y Wood where X*6 < Y*11 (e.g., 2 Wheat for 1 Wood: 12 -> 11, bad). Need more Wood for less Wheat. 1 Wood for 3 Wheat (11 -> 18, good for me).\n- Offer X Wood for Y Sheep where X*11 < Y*15 (e.g., 1 Wood for 1 Sheep (11 -> 15, good for me). I tried this and it was rejected).\n- Offer X Sheep for Y Brick where X*15 < Y*26 (e.g., 1 Sheep for 1 Brick (15 -> 26, good for me, would mean giving up Sheep to get Brick).\n- Offer X Brick for Y Ore where X*26 < Y*37 (e.g., 1 Brick for 1 Ore (26 -> 37, good for me).\n\nPlayer 1 seems to want Wood and Wheat (based on Brick offers).\nI want Brick or Sheep.\n\nLet's try an offer that combines Wheat and perhaps a little Wood to get a higher value item.\nI have an abundance of Wheat (22) and Wood (25).\nIf I offer `5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep`: Value (5*6 = 30) for 1 Sheep (15). Bad for me.\nIf I offer `2 Wood -> 1 Sheep`: Value (2*11 = 22) for 1 Sheep (15). This is what Player 1 offered, and it's bad for me. So I should not offer this.\n\nWhat if Player 1 is looking to build? Brick, Wood, Wheat are general building materials.\nMy previous offers for Brick were too low for them.\n\nI will reject the current offer.\nThen, I need to make a new offer.\nI want to gain value.\nI have a ton of Wheat (22) and Wood (25).\n\nLet's consider trading Wood for Brick directly if I can get a good ratio.\nOffer: 1 Wood (11) -> ? Brick (26). I'd need to give 1 Wood and some other small value item for 1 Brick.\nMy previously rejected offer for Brick: `2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick` (value 23 -> 26).\nThis was a very good deal for me. Player 1 rejected it.\n\nLet's try to get a Sheep from them, as they have offered Sheep before.\nI previously offered `1 Wood -> 1 Sheep` (11 for 15, profit 4). Denied.\nThey offered `1 Sheep -> 2 Wood` (15 for 22, loss 7). Denied by me.\n\nThis implies they value 1 Sheep at roughly 2 Wood or more.\nIf 1 Sheep is worth 2 Wood to them (22 value), then my 1 Wood for 1 Sheep (11 for 15) is way off their perceived ratio.\nThey think I should give more for their Sheep.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Wood and 1 Wheat for 1 Sheep?\nValue offered: 1 Wood (11) + 1 Wheat (6) = 17.\nValue gained: 1 Sheep (15).\nThis is a loss of 2 value for me.\n\nWhat about trying to get more Wood from Player 1's Wood supply?\nOr can I acquire Brick or Ore for my excess Wheat?\n\nLet's consider an offer that is very clear value gain for me, even if it's small.\nI have a very large quantity of Wheat (22) and Wood (25).\nMy priority is to turn these into higher value resources.\n\nI will try to make another attempt to get Brick.\nPlayer 1 has shown inclination to trade Brick for Wheat and Wood, but at a very unfavorable rate for me.\nMy resources: Wheat 22 (6), Wood 25 (11), Sheep 9 (15), Brick 6 (26), Ore 20 (37).\n\nLet's try to make an offer for Brick again.\nI want to give away Wheat.\nPerhaps: `3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick`?\nValue offered: (3*6) + 11 = 18 + 11 = 29.\nValue received: 1 Brick (26). This is a loss of 3 value for me. Not good.\n\nI should make an offer that results in a net gain for me or at least breaks even while offloading something I have in excess.\n\nLet's focus on offloading Wheat or Wood for Sheep first, as Player 1 has offered Sheep.\nThey offered 1 Sheep for 2 Wood (15 for 22, -7 value for me).\nWhat if I offer 3 Wood for 2 Sheep? (3*11 = 33 value for 2*15 = 30 value, -3 value for me, bad).\n\nLet's stick to simple trades for now, given the history of rejections.\nI have a big quantity of Wood.\nWhat if I offer a resource that is less valuable for more of my low-value resources?\nFor example, I could offer 1 Sheep for a quantity of Wheat and Wood. This is only good if I manage to get a lot of Wheat/Wood for it AND I already have plenty of Sheep, which I do (9). However, my goal is to *increase* total value or convert low to high value. So trading Sheep for lower value items is not good unless the quantity is very large.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 is also trying to optimize their value.\nPlayer 1 is asking for a lot of Wood.\nI have plenty of Wood.\nWhat if I give away some Wood, to gain a slightly better resource?\n\nIf I offer, say, 3 Wood for 2 Sheep.\nValue offered: 3 * 11 = 33.\nValue received: 2 * 15 = 30. This is a net loss of 3 for me.\n\nI need to be more aggressive in acquiring valuable items.\nI have plenty of Ore (20) and Brick (6). These are my most valuable resources.\nWheat (22) and Wood (25) are my most plentiful and lowest value.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat for Sheep.\nOffer: `4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep`\nValue offered: 4 * 6 = 24\nValue received: 15\nLoss of 9 value. Bad.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of my plentiful resources to get a single, more valuable one?\nExample: `2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep` (23 for 15, bad)\n\nMy strategy has been to offer things that are clearly beneficial to me and hoping Player 1 accepts. Player 1 has been making offers that are beneficial to them or very bad for me (e.g. 1 Brick for 5 Wheat, 2 Wood, or 1 Sheep for 2 Wood). This suggests Player 1 is also trying to maximize their own value and is not willing to give away much.\n\nLet's be realistic. My earlier offer of `1 Wood -> 1 Sheep` was rejected.\nAnd Player 1 offered `1 Sheep -> 2 Wood`.\nThis indicates that Player 1 values 1 Sheep at least as much as 2 Wood.\n1 Sheep value = 15. 2 Wood value = 22.\nSo Player 1 wants to get 22 value by giving up 15 value. That's a good deal for them.\n\nIf I want to get 1 Sheep, I would have to offer at least 2 Wood, or something of similar value.\nIf I offer `2 Wood -> 1 Sheep`, I lose 7 value. I won't do that.\n\nMy last offer `1 Wood -> 1 Sheep` was denied by Player 1.\nThe offer they just made `1 Sheep -> 2 Wood` was denied by me.\n\nBoth players are valuing Sheep and Wood differently.\nPlayer 1 values 1 Sheep as >= 2 Wood.\nI value 1 Sheep as >= 1 Wood and < 2 Wood (since I denied their offer).\nWhat if I meet somewhere in the middle? `1 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Sheep`?\nMy value: 11 + 6 = 17. Their value: 15. This is still a loss for me.\n\nMy goal is to increase total value.\nI will deny Player 1's offer.\n\nNow, for my offer.\nI have a significant amount of Wheat and Wood.\nI will again try to get Brick or Sheep.\nLet me try to exchange low-value resources for a single, high-value one.\nI have 22 Wheat. I should use them.\n\nWhat if I offer an unbalanced trade where I give a lot of my cheap stuff for a little bit of their good stuff?\nLike `10 Wheat -> 1 Brick`? Value 60 for 26. Horrible for me.\nI need to offer something that is *slightly* less than their value, but still profitable for me.\n\nSince they seem to want Wood, I'll leverage that.\nOffer: `1 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Sheep` (Value given: 11+6=17, Value gained: 15). Not good.\n\nLet's think. My last accepted trade was none. All denials.\nHow to move forward?\nPerhaps, I should trade some of my very abundant resources for other resources, even if the value gain is small, to diversify and make future trades easier.\nLike trading Wheat for Wood, or vice-versa, if I could get a good rate. (e.g., 1 Wood for 2 Wheat).\n\nWhat if I try to get Brick by offering a mix of resources, but ensure I gain value?\nI want 1 Brick (26 value).\nMy best offer for 1 Brick that was rejected was `2 Wheat, 1 Wood` (23 value).\nPlayer 1 wanted `4 Wheat, 2 Wood` (46 value) or `5 Wheat, 2 Wood` (52 value) for 1 Brick.\nThe difference is huge.\n\nGiven they want a lot of Wheat and Wood for their Brick, I could try to give them a lot of my Wheat (which I have in abundance) in exchange for 1 Brick.\nWhat if I offer `3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick`? (Value: 18+11=29 for 26 - loss of 3). Still not good.\n\nI need a trade that has a net positive for me.\nThe only way to do that if I'm trading for a higher value resource is:\n(Qty_A * Val_A) + (Qty_B * Val_B) < (Qty_X * Val_X)\nExample: 1 Wood (11) for 1 Sheep (15). (11 < 15, net +4). Rejected.\n\nIt seems Player 1 is not accepting trades that are significantly beneficial to me.\nI need to be more aggressive in my \"request\" for resources.\n\nLet's try to sell some of my abundant Wheat for something slightly better.\nSince Player 1 previously offered `1 Brick -> 4 Wheat, 2 Wood`\nThey valued 1 Brick as 4 Wheat and 2 Wood (46 value for them).\nWhat if I offered `1 Brick -> 2 Wheat, 1 Wood` (23 value) This was rejected.\n\nMy current resource quantities are 22 W, 25 Wd, 9 S, 6 B, 20 O.\n\nI'll reject player 1's offer.\nFor my new offer, I'll try to get more sheep, as they seem to have sheep and want wood.\nPerhaps a slightly better offer for them than my previous rejected one.\n\nMy value: 11 Wood for 15 Sheep (+4).\nTheir latest offer 15 Sheep for 22 Wood (-7 for me).\n\nThe midpoint is roughly 1 Wood and some fraction of Wood.\nWhat if I offer 1 Wood and 1 Brick for 2 Sheep?\nValue offered: 11 + 26 = 37.\nValue gained: 2 * 15 = 30. Loss for me.\n\nI need to focus on what Player 1 is asking for explicitly or implicitly.\nThey have asked for Wood multiple times.\nThey have offered Sheep.\n\nSo, potentially they need Wood and are willing to offload Sheep.\nBut at a bad rate for me.\n\nI will offer this: `1 Wood -> 1 Sheep`. I know I tried this before. But it's my best value trade that's simple.\nValue given: 11. Value received: 15. Net +4.\nIf they are desperate enough for Wood, maybe they will accept this time.\nI really need to get my average resource value up.\nI have a ton of Wood, and this trade helps.\n\nIf forced to make an offer, I would try this again. It's the most profitable simple trade for me given my resources.\nI will reject Player 1's offer. Then make my own.\n\nFinal decision process:\n1. Deny Player 1's offer: `1 Sheep -> 2 Wood`. This is a loss of 7 value for me (15 value gained, 22 value lost).\n2. Evaluate my own resources and goals: Increase total value. I have plenty of Wheat (22, value 6) and Wood (25, value 11). I want more Sheep (15), Brick (26) or Ore (37).\n3. Review Player 1's likely needs: They seem to want Wood, as shown by their several rejected offers (Brick for Wheat+Wood, and this Sheep for Wood offer).\n4. Formulate a new offer: Leverage my excess Wood and Player 1's need for it. The most direct value-gaining trade for me given this dynamic is `1 Wood -> 1 Sheep` (11 value given for 15 value gained, net +4 value). This was rejected previously, but it's the most logical profitable trade to attempt again, as Player 1 just reaffirmed their interest in Wood. I might also consider trying to trade Wheat for Wood if Player 1 wants Wheat AND has some surplus Wood, though this trade is less valuable for me. For now, let's stick with the Sheep.\n\nI understand I am Player 0. I denied their offer. Now I must make an offer.\nI will try the most profitable one for me based on the clear preference for Wood from Player 1.\nI have 25 Wood, so I can spare 1 to make this offer.\nThinking about Player 1's perspective: if they need Wood, and I offer 1 Wood for 1 Sheep, they get the Wood they need, and might consider their Sheep less valuable than the Wood if they are in crisis, or if they have plenty of Sheep than I expected.\nThis is a small, but positive gain for me if accepted.\nThe other options for gaining value (getting Brick or Ore) seem to require me to give up more as Player 1 values them so highly, making a profitable trade difficult.\n\nI'm playing the long game by consistently making offers that are beneficial to me, rather than just accepting ones that are bad.\nLet's try 1 Wood for 1 Sheep again.\nStep 1: Deny player 1's offer of '1 Sheep -> 2 Wood'.\nStep 2: Make my offer.\nWhat to offer: `1 Wood -> 1 Sheep`.\nThis is a net gain of 4 value for me (15 - 11 = 4).\nPlayer 1 has shown interest in obtaining Wood. This trade still gives them Wood. It might be accepted if they realize they are asking for too much or if their need for Wood is desperate.\nIf they reject it again, I might have to consider a different type of trade next round.\nBut for now, this is the best value trade I can conceive given the opponent's behavior and my goals.\nThe quantities of my resources will change:\n- If accepted: Wood: 24, Sheep: 10. Total value: 1438 - 11 + 15 = 1442. This is a positive change.\nMy aim is to increase the total value.\n\nMy proposed action for Player 0 will be:\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep]",

      "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Current Situation and Goals:**  \n   I'm Player 1, and my objective is to ensure that any trade increases the total value of my resources based on my personal valuations: Wheat (5 each), Wood (11 each), Sheep (16 each), Brick (29 each), and Ore (37 each). I currently have abundant Wheat (24), Wood (12), Brick (16), and Ore (25), but I'm low on Sheep (only 5). The game has a total of 10 turns, and from the history, we've had multiple rejected offers, indicating both players are being selective. The latest offer from Player 0 is: 1 Wood in exchange for 1 Sheep. I need to evaluate this and decide on my next action.\n\n2. **Evaluating the Current Offer:**  \n   - Player 0's offer: They want 1 Sheep (valued at 16 to me) in exchange for 1 Wood (valued at 11 to me).  \n   - Net value change for me: Giving up 16 value and receiving 11 value results in a loss of 5 value (16 - 11 = -5). This does not align with my goal of increasing total value, so I should reject it. Sheep is one of my more valuable resources per unit, and I'm already low on it, making this an unfavorable deal.\n\n3. **Factors Influencing My Decision-Making:**  \n   - **Resource Abundance and Scarcity:** I have excess Wheat, Wood, Brick, and Ore, so I'm more willing to trade those if it benefits me. However, I should prioritize trades that give me more value than I give up.  \n   - **Past Interactions:** Player 0 has consistently offered Wheat and Wood while requesting Brick or Sheep, suggesting they may be short on those. They've rejected my previous offers (e.g., 1 Brick for 5 Wheat and 2 Wood), so I need to propose something they might find appealing while ensuring I gain value. The game is turn-limited, so I should be proactive but not desperate\u2014I only make offers that result in a net gain.  \n   - **Opponent's Potential Needs:** Player 0 seems interested in Sheep (as they've requested it multiple times), so they might be willing to part with Wheat or Wood for it. However, I must ensure any counteroffer maximizes my value.\n\n4. **What Might My Opponent Be Thinking or Needing?**  \n   From the offer history, Player 0 is pushing for Sheep, which implies they might value it highly and have surplus Wheat or Wood. They could be trying to build resources for later turns, so offering something they want (like Sheep) in exchange for more of what I value (like multiple Wheat) might entice them. However, since they've rejected similar offers before, I need to adjust slightly to make it more attractive while still benefiting me.\n\n5. **Overall Strategy and Decision:**  \n   - First, I must deny the current offer since it's a net loss.  \n   - For a new offer, I want to propose a trade where the value I receive exceeds the value I give. For example, offering 1 Sheep (16 value) in exchange for 4 Wheat (4 * 5 = 20 value) would result in a net gain of 4 value (20 - 16 = +4). This uses my limited Sheep to acquire more Wheat, which aligns with my abundance and increases my total value. It's a slight adjustment from my previous offers, potentially making it more appealing to Player 0.  \n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 4 Wheat]",

They seem to be trying to get a lot of Wheat/Wood for 1 Brick or 1 Sheep.\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is: `[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 4 Wheat]`.\nValue of what I receive (1 Sheep): 15\nValue of what I give (4 Wheat): 4 * 6 = 24\nThis trade would result in a loss of 24 - 15 = 9 value for me.

I want to convert these into higher-value resources like Brick, Sheep, or Ore.\n\nLet's analyze my previous trades:\n- Tried to get Brick/Sheep for Wheat/Wood. Rejected.\n- Tried to get Sheep for Wood. Rejected.\n\nPlayer 1 has been consistently trying to get a lot of low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for a single higher-value resource (Brick, Sheep). Their offers are always disadvantageous to me.\n\nI need to make a trade that clearly benefits me.\nI have a significant amount of Wood and Wheat. I should target trading these for Brick or Ore. Sheep is also good, but Brick and Ore are better.\n\nWhat if I try to offer Wood for Brick?\n1 Wood (11) for 1 Brick (26) would be +15 value. This is a good trade for me, but Player 1 has rejected similar trades where I asked for Brick for multiple low-value items. Asking for a single Brick for a single Wood is even more advantageous to me, so it's unlikely Player 1 would accept.\n\nWhat if I try to get Ore by offering multiple resources?\nI have a large quantity of Ore (20). I might be able to use some of it to secure a better trade if I need to rebalance my portfolio, but my primary goal is to increase value, and Ore is my highest value resource. I should avoid trading away Ore unless I get a huge return.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 is also trying to increase their value, and they have an internal valuation similar to mine but perhaps different needs based on their hidden inventory.\nGiven their pattern, they might be rich in Sheep and Brick and poor in Wheat and Wood.\n\nI have 22 Wheat and 25 Wood. These are my most abundant low-value resources.\nI want Brick or Ore. Brick is perhaps more attainable.\n\nIf I offer, say, 5 Wood (55 value) for 2 Brick (52 value), it's a loss for me.\nIf I offer 2 Wood (22 value) for 1 Brick (26 value), it's +4 value for me. This is a small gain. Player 1 might accept this if they need wood.\nIt's a step up from previous offers where I offered 2 Wheat, 1 Wood (2*6+1*11=23) for 1 Brick (26). That was also a +3 gain, but they rejected. Perhaps they need more Wood or prioritize Brick more.\n\nLet me think about what Player 1 is offering. They consistently try to get 4-5 Wheat + 2 Wood for 1 Brick, or 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep.\nThis implies they value Wheat and Wood highly (or desperately need them) and have a surplus of Brick/Sheep.\nTheir offer for [1 Sheep -> 4 Wheat] suggests they want to offload Sheep and get Wheat. My valuation of Sheep (15) vs 4 Wheat (24) makes it a bad deal for me.\n\nI want to acquire Brick or Ore. Sheep is also good.\nSince Player 1 seems to have a surplus of Sheep, perhaps I can get Sheep for Wood at a favorable rate.\nMy earlier offer: 1 Wood (11) -> 1 Sheep (15). This is +4 for me. Player 1 rejected this.\nPlayer 1's counter: 1 Sheep (15) -> 2 Wood (22). This is -7 for me. I rejected this.\n\nIt seems we are at an impasse regarding Sheep for Wood. Player 1 wants a lot of Wood for their Sheep, and I don't want to overpay.\n\nLet me re-evaluate the Brick trade. I previously offered 2 Wheat, 1 Wood (value 23) for 1 Brick (value 26). This was +3 value for me. Player 1 rejected.\nPerhaps Player 1 thinks 2 Wheat, 1 Wood is not enough for 1 Brick.\n\nWhat if I offer a slightly higher amount of my resources for 1 Brick?\nIf I offer 3 Wood (value 33) for 1 Brick (value 26), it's a loss for me.\nIf I offer 3 Wheat, 1 Wood (3*6 + 11 = 18+11 = 29) for 1 Brick (26). This is also a loss.\n\nGiven Player 1's rejection patterns, they consistently attempt to extract significant value from me.\nMy current strategy should be to improve my resource value.\nI have a lot of low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) and sufficient high-value resources (Ore, Brick, Sheep).\nI should aim to convert Wheat/Wood into Brick/Ore/Sheep.\n\nSince Player 1 rejected my sensible offers and constantly proposes highly unfavourable ones for me, I need to either:\n1. Find a niche where our valuations align better.\n2. Make a very slight loss on paper for Player 1 but good for me.\n3. Be patient and wait for Player 1 to become more desperate.\n\nConsider the current state: Player 1 offered `1 Sheep -> 4 Wheat`. Value: 15 for 24, a loss of 9. Reject.\nWhat if I try to offer Sheep for Brick? I have 9 Sheep.\nIf I offer 1 Sheep (15) for 1 Brick (26), it's a gain of 11. This is a very good trade for me, but highly unlikely Player 1 accepts.\n\nLet's try to offload some Wheat. Currently, I have 22 Wheat.\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of Wheat for something small?\nE.g., 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Brick (26). Loss of 4. Bad.\nE.g., 3 Wheat (18) for 1 Sheep (15). Loss of 3. Bad.\n\nWhat about trading Wood for Brick?\n1 Wood (11) for 1 Brick (26) is +15. This is my best possible trade, but Player 1 might never accept something this favorable to me.\n\nPerhaps I can offer 1 Wood for something smaller, like 1 Wheat from Player 1 (if they are short). But that's not increasing my value by much.\n\nI need to make an offer that is *perceived* as fair or slightly advantageous for Player 1, but still beneficial to me.\nPlayer 1 consistently offered `1 Brick -> 4-5 Wheat, 2 Wood`. This means they want a LOT of Wheat and Wood.\nMy previous offer of `2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick` was rejected. (Value: 23 -> 26, +3 for me)\nWhat if I slightly increase the offer?\nIf I offer `3 Wheat, 1 Wood` (3*6 + 11 = 29) for `1 Brick` (26). This is a loss of 3 for me. Not good.\n\nI need to find a way to gain value.\nMy current analysis suggests that Player 1 values my Wheat and Wood very highly.\nThey offered `1 Sheep -> 4 Wheat`. Value: 15 for 24.\nLet's try to reverse this at a better rate for me.\nMy previous offer `1 Wood -> 1 Sheep` (11 for 15, +4 for me) was rejected.\nPlayer 1's previous offer `1 Sheep -> 2 Wood` (15 for 22, -7 for me) was rejected.\n\nIt seems Player 1 wants a lot of specific resources (Wheat, Wood) and is trying to get them at a discount using their higher value resources (Brick, Sheep).\nI need to get higher value resources (Brick, Sheep, Ore) for my lower value resources (Wheat, Wood).\n\nLet's try another trade of Wood for Sheep, but a slightly less aggressive one for Player 1.\nWhat if I offer 2 Wood (22 value) for 1 Sheep (15 value)? This would be an outright loss of 7 for me. No.\n\nI have 25 Wood. It's a significant quantity.\nWhat if I offer an exchange of different tiers?\nE.g., 1 Wood (11) for 1/2 of a Brick (conceptually). This is hard to do with integer quantities.\n\nLet's check the current offer again: `[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 4 Wheat]`\nMy value: Receive 1 Sheep (15), Give 4 Wheat (24). Total gain: 15 - 24 = -9. I must reject.\n\nI need to make my own offer.\nPriorities: Convert Wheat/Wood into Brick/Ore/Sheep.\nSmallest beneficial trade for me:\n1 Wood (11) for 1 Sheep (15) -> +4. Rejected.\n2 Wheat, 1 Wood (23) for 1 Brick (26) -> +3. Rejected.\n\nPlayer 1 is really trying to extract maximum value.\nPerhaps I should try to trade away a little bit of my higher value resources if it leads to a net gain or helps me rebalance.\nI have 20 Ore (37). I could offer 1 Ore (37) for 2 Brick (52). That's a gain of 15. Good for me.\nBut Player 1 seems to have a surplus of Brick, so they might not need more Brick.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wheat and Wood for ONE high-value item, making it extremely attractive for Player 1, but still positive for me?\nLet's try to get 1 Brick, since Player 1 has frequently offered it.\nGoal: Brick (26).\nOffer: 3 Wood (33) -> This is too much, a loss for me.\nOffer: 2 Wood (22) -> This results in a gain of 4. Player 1 rejected 2W+1W earlier which was similar value. Maybe just Wood is better?\nOffer: 4 Wheat (24) -> This results in a gain of 2. Very marginal.\n\nLet's try to make an offer that is slightly worse for them than my optimal, but still better than their current ridiculous offers to me.\nPlayer 1 repeatedly offered 1 Brick for 5 Wheat, 2 Wood (5*6 + 2*11 = 30 + 22 = 52). This means they value 1 Brick at 52 using their own calculations, while the base value is 26. This implies either they are desperate for Wheat/Wood or they have a huge surplus of Brick and want to dump it for anything.\nIf they are willing to pay 52 for 1 Brick, then I should aim for something in between 26 and 52 for 1 Brick.\n\nMy best offer so far that got rejected for Brick was `2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick` (value: 23 for 26, +3 benefit).\nLet's make it a tiny bit less favorable for me but still better than their offers.\nWhat if I increase the Wheat/Wood slightly?\nTry `3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick` (value: 29 for 26, this is a loss for me). Not good.\n\nI will try again for Sheep. Player 1 needs Wheat.\nOffer `3 Wheat (18) -> 1 Sheep (15)`? That's a loss for me.\nPlayer 1 asked for 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep. (-9 value for me).\nMy offer: 1 Wood (11) for 1 Sheep (15). (+4 value for me). Rejected.\n\nIt's clear Player 1 isn't going to accept offers that give me much value. I need to tempt them with something they need, while still making a small gain for myself.\nI have a large quantity of Wood.\nWhat if I offer a 1:1 trade for 1 Wood to 1 Wheat? No gain.\nI need to gain a higher value resource.\n\nLet's consider the value of 1 Brick (26). Player 1 has made multiple offers to trade 1 Brick for 5 Wheat, 2 Wood (value 52). This means they are willing to *pay* 52 value in Wheat and Wood to get 1 Brick, or they value Wheat/Wood so highly that 52 of it equals 26 of Brick value. This suggests they are desperate for Wheat and Wood resources.\n\nI should leverage this.\nI need to offer a good amount of Wheat/Wood that is still less than 52, but greater than the base value of Brick (26), so they see a gain too.\nIf I offer 4 Wood (44 value) for 1 Brick (26 value), it's a loss for me.\nIf I offer 3 Wood (33 value) for 1 Brick (26 value), it's a loss for me.\n\nThe target is always to get HIGHER value.\nI have 22 Wheat (Value 6) and 25 Wood (Value 11).\nHigh-value targets: Ore (37), Brick (26), Sheep (15).\n\nGiven Player 1's last offer was `1 Sheep -> 4 Wheat`. They really want Wheat.\nValue: 1 Sheep (15) for 4 Wheat (24).\nMy current resources:\nWheat: 22 Value: 6\nWood: 25 Value: 11\nSheep: 9 Value: 15\nBrick: 6 Value: 26\nOre: 20 Value: 37\n\nI will try to trade Wheat for Sheep or Brick, but at a rate that benefits me.\nWhat if I offer 2 Wheat (12) for 1 Sheep (15)? This is a gain of +3 for me.\nPlayer 1 asked for 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep. My offer is half of what they asked.\nIt's unlikely Player 1 would accept this given their past rejections.\n\nI will try a trade that takes into account Player 1's apparent desperation for Wheat/Wood and desire to shed Brick/Sheep, but still results in a gain for me.\nPlayer 1 repeatedly offered 1 Brick for 5 Wheat, 2 Wood (valued at 52).\nMy previous rejection was 2 Wheat, 1 Wood (23) for 1 Brick (26). This was a +3 gain for me.\nPlayer 1 also rejected 1 Wood (11) for 1 Sheep (15). This was a +4 gain for me.\n\nMy goal is to make a positive value trade.\nI will propose an offer that is \"close\" to what Player 1 is offering, but in my favor.\nPlayer 1 offered `1 Sheep -> 4 Wheat`. Value: 15 for 24.\nLet's assume Player 1 is short on Wheat and wants to get rid of Sheep (since they have 9 Sheep and offered it).\nI can offer a lower quantity of Wheat for their Sheep.\nWhat if I offer 1 Wheat (6) for 1 Sheep (15)? This is a +9 gain for me, but highly unlikely Player 1 accepts.\n\nLet's think about perceived value for Player 1 versus actual value for me.\nPlayer 1 consistently asked for 4-5 Wheat and 2 Wood for 1 Brick.\nLet's offer a combination of Wheat and Wood that still gains me value.\nThe last successful trade I attempted was to gain 1 Brick for `2 Wheat, 1 Wood` (+3 value). Rejected.\n\nI am high on Wheat and Wood. Player 1 seems desperate for those.\nI will try to leverage my surplus.\nI need to make a tempting offer that they *might* accept.\nIf they are willing to pay 52 value for 1 Brick, maybe I can give them something less than 52 but more than 26, AND get a net gain.\nThis is difficult. If I offer 3 Wood (33) for 1 Brick (26), I lose 7.\nIf I offer 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Brick (26), I lose 4.\n\nI need to target a small gain.\nI will try an offer similar to my last rejected one (2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick which was +3), but maybe increase the Wheat slightly to make it more appealing to Player 1, without going negative for myself.\n\nThe current offer is `[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 4 Wheat]`. Value for me: 15 - 24 = -9. Deny.\n\nI will try to get 1 Sheep for Wheat, because Player 1 offered 1 Sheep for 4 Wheat. This means they are willing to exchange Sheep for Wheat.\nTheir current valuation is 1 Sheep = 4 Wheat. (15 = 24).\nWhat if I offer `3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep` and get a gain? Value: 18 -> 15. This is a loss of 3 for me.\nWhat if I offer `2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep`? Value: 12 -> 15. This is a gain of 3 for me.\nGiven they wanted 4 Wheat, offering 2 Wheat is half, and they might reject.\nBut if they were offering 1 Sheep for 4 Wheat, they are valuing Sheep at 24 and Wheat at 6.\nI should try to get 1 Sheep for minimal Wheat.\n\nLet's try to get a Brick.\nTarget: 1 Brick (value 26).\nOffer: 3 Wood (value 33). Loss of 7. No.\nOffer: 2 Wood (value 22). Gain of 4.\nPlayer 1 rejected 2 Wheat, 1 Wood (23) for 1 Brick (26) before. My offer of 2 Wood (22) for 1 Brick (26) is similar value-wise for me, still +4.\n\nI need to offer a trade that is clearly beneficial to me (increases total value) and has a chance of being accepted by Player 1.\nPlayer 1's goal seems to be to acquire Wheat/Wood.\nMy goal is to offload Wheat/Wood for Sheep/Brick/Ore.\n\nMy offer for 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep (+4 gain) was rejected.\nMy offer for 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick (+3 gain) was rejected.\n\nI will make a slight adjustment that might make it more attractive to Player 1 based on their need for Wheat, while still giving me a positive value.\nI will stick with getting Brick.\nInstead of 2 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Brick (value 23 vs 26), what if I offer 3 Wheat for 1 Brick? (Value 18 vs 26, +8 gain). Unlikely.\nWhat about a trade like \"2 Wood for 1 Brick\"? This is 22 vs 26 (+4).\nIt is similar in value to my previously rejected 2 Wheat, 1 Wood.\nPlayer 1 has shown a strong preference for Wheat and Wood, especially in larger quantities, to get Brick.\n\nI will try to make an offer for Brick again. I have plenty of Wheat and Wood.\nWhat about: 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Brick (26)? Loss of 4. No.\n\nI must make a trade that increases my total value.\nI will offer a quantity of Wheat + Wood to acquire a Brick, ensuring a small gain.\nI'll offer `1 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick`.\nValue offered: (1 * 6) + (2 * 11) = 6 + 22 = 28.\nValue requested: 1 Brick = 26.\nThis is a loss of 2 for me. Not good.\n\nI really need to make a gain.\nWhat about offering more of a specific resource they seem to want, but still gaining?\nE.g., 3 Wood (33) for 2 Sheep (30). Loss of 3.\n\nLet's be aggressive for a small gain.\nMaybe Player 1's rejections are just them trying to push for more from me.\nMy best odds of a gain are to trade low value for high value.\nI will stick to trying to get 1 Brick for 2 Wood. It's a clean offer and a gain of 4.\nIt matches my target of generating a positive value trade.\n\nCurrent offer from Player 1: `[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 4 Wheat]`. Value for me: -9. Deny.\n\nI need to propose a new trade.\nI will propose the `2 Wood -> 1 Brick` trade again.\nPlayer 1 previously rejected `2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick`. My new offer is `2 Wood -> 1 Brick`.\nThe value exchange for me is +4 (getting 26 for 22), where the previous was +3 (getting 26 for 23).\nIt's slightly better for *me* in value, but perhaps simpler or perceived as more valuable to P1 if they really need Wood.\nIt is hard to predict Player 1, but I need to hold firm on gaining value.\n\nProposed action: Deny Player 1's offer, then make my own.Step-by-step reasoning:\n1.  **Analyze Current Resources and Goals:**\n    *   My resources: Wheat (22, value 6), Wood (25, value 11), Sheep (9, value 15), Brick (6, value 26), Ore (20, value 37).\n    *   Total current value: (22*6) + (25*11) + (9*15) + (6*26) + (20*37) = 132 + 275 + 135 + 156 + 740 = 1438.\n    *   Goal: Increase total resource value. This means trading lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n    *   Resource value hierarchy (from lowest to highest): Wheat (6) < Wood (11) < Sheep (15) < Brick (26) < Ore (37).\n    *   My most abundant low-value resources are Wheat and Wood. I should prioritize trading these away for higher-value resources.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Player 1's Last Offer:**\n    *   Player 1 offered: `[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 4 Wheat]`\n    *   Value I receive: 1 Sheep = 15\n    *   Value I give: 4 Wheat = 4 * 6 = 24\n    *   Net change for me: 15 - 24 = -9. This is a significant loss in value. I should definitely reject this offer.\n\n3.  **Analyze Previous Trade History with Player 1:**\n    *   Player 1 consistently tries to offload Brick and Sheep in exchange for large quantities of Wheat and Wood.\n    *   Player 1 recently offered `1 Brick -> 5 Wheat, 2 Wood` (my value: 26 for 52, a loss of 26). This significant offer implies they value/need Wheat and Wood highly and are willing to take a large 'loss' in their own implied valuation to get them, or they have a massive surplus of Brick.\n    *   My previous offers (`2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick` for a +3 gain; `1 Wood -> 1 Sheep` for a +4 gain) have been rejected.\n    *   Player 1 last offered `1 Sheep -> 2 Wood` (my value: 15 for 22, a loss of 7 for me).\n\n4.  **Formulate a Strategy for My Next Offer:**\n    *   Player 1 seems desperate for Wheat and Wood. I have a surplus of both.\n    *   I need to make an offer that is perceived as attractive to Player 1 (by giving them Wheat/Wood) but still results in a net gain for me.\n    *   Given Player 1's willingness to give 1 Brick for 5 Wheat + 2 Wood (value 52 according to me), they place a very high premium on Wheat/Wood. This creates an opportunity for me to trade for Brick on better terms.\n    *   I want a positive value trade. My previous best rejected offer was `2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick` (+3 gain). I will try to improve on this, or offer something simpler.\n    *   Considering Player 1's need for Wood, a direct trade of Wood for Brick might be clearer and potentially more appealing.\n    *   My proposed offer of `2 Wood -> 1 Brick`:\n        *   Value I give: 2 Wood = 2 * 11 = 22\n        *   Value I receive: 1 Brick = 26\n        *   Net change for me: 26 - 22 = +4. This is a positive value gain for me.\n        *   This offer is simpler and has a slight value improvement for me compared to my previous rejected Brick trade (from +3 to +4). It's also significantly less value for Player 1 than their offer of 5 Wheat + 2 Wood for 1 Brick (which was 52 value). This might make it an appealing prospect for Player 1 if they are truly desperate for wood.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    *   Reject Player 1's current offer as it's a significant loss (-9 value).\n    *   Propose a trade that benefits me by converting my high-quantity, low-value Wood into higher-value Brick, leveraging Player 1's apparent need for Wood.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
