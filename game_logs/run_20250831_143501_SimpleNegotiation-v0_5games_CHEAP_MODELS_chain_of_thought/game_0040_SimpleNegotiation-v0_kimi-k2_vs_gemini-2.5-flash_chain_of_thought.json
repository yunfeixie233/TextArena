I need to be strategic about my trades.\n\nLet's evaluate the current offer from Player 0: \"Offered items: 3 Brick -> Requested items: 2 Ore\"\n\nValue of what Player 0 is offering me:\n*   3 x [Brick] = 3 * 21 = 63\n\nValue of what Player 0 is asking from me:\n*   2 x [Ore] = 2 * 32 = 64\n\nAnalysis of the offer:\nPlayer 0 is offering me 63 value for 64 value. This is a net loss of 1 in value for me. Therefore, I should not accept this offer as is.\n\nMy current resource quantities:\n*   Wheat: 16 (High)\n*   Wood: 19 (High)\n*   Sheep: 21 (Very High)\n*   Brick: 5 (Low)\n*   Ore: 14 (Medium)\n\nI have a very high quantity of Sheep and relatively high quantities of Wheat and Wood. My Brick quantity is very low. Player 0 seems to be in need of Ore, which is a high-value resource. I also have a decent quantity of Ore (14).\n\nSince the current offer is a slight loss, I should consider a counter-offer. I want to gain value.\nI have a lot of Sheep. Perhaps I can trade some Sheep for something I need or that is valuable.\nI have very few Bricks, so acquiring more Brick might be good, especially if I can get them cheaply in terms of value. However, the offer is for Brick, and it's a net loss. This suggests Player 0 values Brick highly, or undervalues Ore.\n\nLet's think about what I might want to offer.\nI want to increase my total value. This means getting resources whose value is greater than the resources I give up, or making exchanges that allow me to accumulate high-value resources.\n\nPlayer 0 wants Ore. Ore is my most valuable resource per unit. I should be careful about trading it away unless I get a significant profit.\n\nConsider my low Brick quantity. If I can trade something abundant like Sheep for Brick, it could be good.\nLet's analyze the relative values:\n*   Wheat: 5\n*   Wood: 11\n*   Sheep: 16\n*   Brick: 21\n*   Ore: 32\n\nPlayer 0 offered 3 Brick (63) for 2 Ore (64). They value Brick very highly or need it.\nI have plenty of Sheep. Could I trade Sheep for Ore, or maybe for Brick at a profit?\n\nIf I offer, say, 3 Sheep (48 value) for 1 Ore (32 value), it's a loss for me.\nThe current offer gives me 3 Brick (63) for 2 Ore (64). This means Player 0 is valuing their 3 Brick at nearly the same as my 2 Ore.\n\nI have a glut of Sheep. I should try to convert some of this high quantity, medium-value resource into higher-value resources.\nWhat if I offer Player 0 something they might need, but at a profit for me?\nThey want Ore. Perhaps I can give them some Ore, but demand more in return from other resources.\n\nLet's reconsider the offer: 3 Brick (63) for 2 Ore (64).\nIf I accept, I lose 1 value. I will deny this as is.\n\nWhat if I counter?\nSince they value Brick, perhaps I can leverage my Sheep to get Brick, then try to trade that Brick later, or simply hold onto it to balance my inventory.\nHowever, I have very little Brick myself. It might be good to get more if the terms are favorable.\n\nWhat if I offer: 1 Ore (32) for 2 Brick (42)? This would be a 10 value gain for me. But Player 0 offered 3 Brick for 2 Ore. So 1 Ore for 2 Brick is a worse deal for them. Unlikely.\n\nWhat if I offer to gain Ore instead of give it? But Player 0 is *requesting* Ore.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep. I should try to trade Sheep for something more valuable.\nWhat if I offer a trade where I give a lot of Sheep for a little of something else?\nExample: 3 Sheep (48) for 1 Wood (11)? No.\n3 Sheep (48) for 1 Brick (21)? No.\n3 Sheep (48) for 1 Ore (32)? No.\n\nLet's try to make an offer that is clearly profitable for me, while still appearing reasonable to Player 0 given their current needs.\nPlayer 0 offered 3 Brick for 2 Ore (63 for 64). They are nearly at par.\nThey want Ore. I have 14 Ore.\n\nIf I try to get more Ore, what can I offer?\nI have 21 Sheep.\nHow about: 5 Sheep (80) for 2 Ore (64)? No, loss.\n4 Sheep (64) for 2 Ore (64)? Par trade. No profit.\n\nI should leverage my high quantities of Sheep, Wheat, or Wood.\nMy goal is to increase value. I should typically trade low-value resources for high-value resources, or resources I have in surplus for resources I need.\n\nLet's consider a counter to their offer.\nThey offered 3 Brick for 2 Ore.\nIf I agree to give them 2 Ore, what would I want in return to make it profitable?\nCurrent value: 2 Ore = 64.\nI need to get *more* than 64 value.\nIf I ask for 4 Brick (84)? This is too much of a jump from their initial offer of 3 Brick.\nHow about 3 Brick + 1 Sheep (63 + 16 = 79)? This is a gain of 15. Player 0 might see this as too much.\nHow about 3 Brick + 1 Wood (63 + 11 = 74)? This is a gain of 10. More plausible.\n\nLet's make a counter-offer that gives Player 0 *some* of what they want (Ore), but ensures I make a profit.\nPlayer 0 wants Ore. I have plenty of Sheep, Wheat, and Wood.\nWhat if I trade something *besides* Ore?\n\nWhat if I offer something I have a lot of, like Sheep, for something more valuable like Brick (which I need)?\nI have 21 Sheep. I only have 5 Brick.\nOffer: 3 Sheep (48) for 2 Brick (42)? My loss.\nOffer: 4 Sheep (64) for 3 Brick (63)? My loss.\n\nI need to gain value.\nPlayer 0 wants Ore. This is my most valuable per unit.\nI could offer 1 Ore (32) for something more.\nE.g., 1 Ore (32) <-> 2 Brick (42)? Player 0 is offering 3 Brick for 2 Ore. So trading 2 Brick for 1 Ore is relatively better for me than the original offer from Player 0, but worse for Player 0, who is getting half the Ore for 2/3 of the Brick.\n\nLet's consider what Player 0 might need given their offer. They want Ore. This is often used for high-value constructions. They're willing to give Brick for it, and Brick is also a resource often used for construction. It indicates they might be building something substantial.\n\nMy strategy should be to get high value resources, especially when I have many low value resources.\nI have 21 Sheep, 19 Wood, 16 Wheat. These are my most abundant resources.\nMy lowest quantities are Brick (5) and Ore (14).\nHowever, Ore is my highest value unit. Brick is also high value.\n\nGiven the offer: Player 0 wants 2 Ore, and is willing to give 3 Brick. Value: 64 for 63.\nI must make a profit.\nIf I give 2 Ore (64), I need to receive something with value > 64.\nWhat about 3 Brick **and** 1 Wheat? (63 + 5 = 68). This is a gain of 4. Slight profit, still gives player 0 their requested 3 Brick.\nWhat about 3 Brick **and** 1 Wood? (63 + 11 = 74). This is a gain of 10. This is better.\nWhat about 3 Brick **and** 1 Sheep? (63 + 16 = 79). This is a gain of 15. This is good, but Sheep is my most abundant resource.\n\nLet's evaluate based on resource scarcity for me. I need Brick.\nOffering to give 2 Ore for 3 Brick is essentially trading valuable Ore for slightly less valuable Brick. Not good.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep. I want to convert Sheep into more valuable resources. Or convert my high quantity of medium value resources into my highest value resource, Ore.\nWhat if I try to get Ore from Player 0? But Player 0 *wants* Ore.\n\nWhat if I try to get Brick from Player 0?\nCurrent offer: 3 Brick for 2 Ore. I don't like giving Ore for Brick at this rate.\n\nLet's formulate a counter that sells my abundance (Sheep, Wood, Wheat) for something I need (Brick, or really, any value increase) OR sells high-value Ore for an even higher value.\n\nTo counter Player 0's offer of (3 B -> 2 O):\nI have 5 Brick. Accumulating more Brick could be strategic.\nIf I give up 2 Ore (64), I want a clear profit.\nIf I target a profit of 10: I need to get 74 value.\nSo, 2 Ore for, say, 3 Brick (63) + 1 Wood (11) = 74.\nThis means I give up 2 Ore, and get 3 Brick and 1 Wood.\nI give (2 * 32) = 64\nI get (3 * 21) + (1 * 11) = 63 + 11 = 74\nNet gain = 10.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable counter. Player 0 still gets the 2 Ore they wanted. They give up 3 Brick, and one cheap resource (Wood). Wood is abundant for me. I should rather try to get rid of Sheep, if possible.\nWhat if I ask for 3 Brick and 1 Sheep instead of 1 Wood?\nOffer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick, 1 Sheep\nI give (2 * 32) = 64\nI get (3 * 21) + (1 * 16) = 63 + 16 = 79\nNet gain = 15.\nThis is a better profit for me. But Player 0 might not want Sheep, as they are giving Brick and asking for Ore which usually indicates a need for building materials. Sheep is less often a building material. However, they might want to diversify.\n\nConsider Player 0's perspective: they offered 3B for 2O. My counter of 2O for 3B and 1Sheep asks them for an additional unit of Sheep. Is 1 Sheep worth 15 value to them? Depends on their needs.\nAlternatively, 2O for 3B and 1Wood. Player 0 offered to give 3B. My counter asks for an additional unit of Wood. Is 1 Wood worth 10 value to them?\n\nIt's a negotiation. I should start with a slightly higher counter that gives me more profit, and be prepared to renegotiate.\nThe 15 value profit with Sheep sounds good. I want to reduce my Sheep quantity if possible.\nIf Player 0 accepts this, it's a very good first trade for me.\n\nLet's compare the options for my counter-offer:\n1.  [Deny] (no action, lose a turn for making profit)\n2.  [Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood] (Profit 10)\n3.  [Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick, 1 Sheep] (Profit 15)\n\nPlayer 0 initially offered 3 Brick for 2 Ore (VALUE 63 for 64).\nThey seem willing to pay close to 64 value for their 2 Ore.\nIf I ask for 3 Brick and 1 Sheep, I'm asking for 79 value. They have to give up 16 more value (1 Sheep) than they initially offered. This is a 25% increase on their offer. It's a bit greedy.\n\nIf I ask for 3 Brick and 1 Wood, I'm asking for 74 value. They have to give up 11 more value (1 Wood) than they initially offered. This is about a 17% increase on their offer. This might be more acceptable for a counter in the first round.\n\nI need to make a profit. Both options do. I prefer the higher profit.\nI should try for the higher profit first, given it's the first turn and the opponent might be open to negotiate.\nPlayer 0 wants Ore. I have it. I am in a stronger position for this specific negotiation.\n\nFinal decision: Deny current offer, and propose a counter-offer by giving 2 Ore to get 3 Brick and 1 Sheep. This yields a value profit of 15.\n\nTotal value: 1178 (current)\nIf trade accepted (2 Ore for 3 Brick, 1 Sheep):\nI lose 2 Ore (2 * 32 = 64 value).\nI gain 3 Brick (3 * 21 = 63 value) and 1 Sheep (1 * 16 = 16 value).\nNet change in value = (63 + 16) - 64 = 79 - 64 = +15.\nNew total value = 1178 + 15 = 1193.\nThis is a profitable trade.\n\nCurrent inventory:\nWheat: 16\nWood: 19\nSheep: 21\nBrick: 5\nOre: 14\n\nAfter proposed trade:\nWheat: 16\nWood: 19\nSheep: 21 + 1 = 22 (This is wrong calculation, I give up something with the offer, not gain it if I'm receiving something.)\nWait, I am giving 2 Ore and requesting 3 Brick, 1 Sheep.\nSo my Sheep quantity would *increase* by 1 if they accept. This is not what I wanted, as I have too much Sheep.\n\nMy target was to reduce my Sheep quantity, or get more high-value resources. This counter offer makes me gain 1 Sheep, which increases my already large Sheep inventory.\nThis might not be the best counter.\n\nLet me rethink the counter-offer based on optimizing my inventory composition.\nI have a surplus of Sheep. I want to *reduce* my Sheep.\nIf Player 0 wants Ore, and they are willing to give Brick, maybe I can give up some of my abundant resources (Sheep, Wood, Wheat) in exchange for Ore or Brick (which I need). But P0 wants Ore, not offering it.\n\nOkay, let's re-evaluate the original offer again:\nP0: 3 Brick (63) -> 2 Ore (64). Net -1 for me. Deny.\n\nMy goal: increase total value, and ideally balance my inventory (reduce Sheep/Wood/Wheat, increase Brick/Ore).\nI have 14 Ore. Gifting 2 Ore reduces my Ore quantity, which is not ideal as it's my highest value resource per unit. I should only do this if the value gain is substantial, or if my Ore quantity is too high. 14 Ore is not \"too high\".\n\nPerhaps I should initiate an offer that suits my needs better.\nWhat if I offer a lot of Sheep for some Ore or Brick?\nExample:\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]\nI give: 5 Sheep (80) + 1 Wood (11) = 91\nI get: 1 Ore (32) + 1 Brick (21) = 53\nThis is a huge loss for me. No.\n\nI need to make an offer that is profitable for me and likely to be considered by Player 0.\nPlayer 0 is short on Ore. My top priority is profit. My secondary priority is inventory balancing (less Sheep/Wheat/Wood, more Brick/Ore).\n\nIf I offer my abundant resources (Sheep/Wood/Wheat) for resources I lack (Brick/Ore).\nHow about: [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood]\nI give: 3 Sheep (48)\nI get: 1 Brick (21) + 1 Wood (11) = 32\nStill a loss of 16. No.\n\nI must ensure profit.\nLet's reconsider giving Ore. If I must give Ore, the profit must be significant.\nP0's offer: 3 Brick (63) for 2 Ore (64).\nIf I give 1 Ore (32) instead of 2. What would I want for it?\nI need > 32 value. How about 2 Brick (42)?\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]\nMy value gain: 42 - 32 = +10.\nPlayer 0's perspective: They get 1 Ore for 2 Brick. Their initial offer was 2 Ore for 3 Brick.\nSo my offer is \"half the Ore for 2/3 of the Brick\". This means they get less Ore for relatively more Brick. This is a worse deal for them compared to their initial offer. They might not accept. But it nets me +10 value, and it gives me Brick (which I need) while only sacrificing 1 Ore.\n\nLet's check the quantities after [Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]\nCurrent Qty: Wheat: 16, Wood: 19, Sheep: 21, Brick: 5, Ore: 14\nAfter Trade: Wheat: 16, Wood: 19, Sheep: 21, Brick: 5+2=7, Ore: 14-1=13\nThe inventory balancing works well here for me (more Brick, less Ore (but still enough)).\nThis seems like a solid potential counter-offer. It's a clear profit for me and improves my inventory. Player 0 still gets high-value Ore, just less of it.\n\nIf I give 1 Ore for 2 Brick.\nMy initial quantities: Brick=5, Ore=14.\nAfter trade: Brick=7, Ore=13.\nThis improves my relatively low Brick count and only slightly reduces my Ore.\n\nLet's compare this to selling my high-quantity Sheep.\nIf I offer 3 SHeep (48):\nI want more than 48 value.\nCould I get 2 Brick (42) for 3 Sheep (48)? No, loss of 6.\nCould I get 1 Ore (32) for 3 Sheep (48)? No, loss of 16.\n\nMy best strategy for *this* turn is to counter-offer by using my high-value Ore to gain even more value from Player 0, who seems keen to acquire Ore.\nThe \"1 Ore -> 2 Brick\" offer is +10 value for me.\n\nThe other option was to deny and make a new offer.\nBut Player 0 already made an offer, so I should counter their offer directly related to their request.\n\nFinal decision: I will deny Player 0's current offer because it results in a net loss. I will propose a counter-offer to trade 1 Ore for 2 Brick, which profits me 10 value and improves my Brick quantity.\n\nOne last check on the 10-turn limit. This is turn 1. Making a profitable trade early is good.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Player 0 offered 3 Brick (Value: 63) for 2 Ore (Value: 64).

      "response": "My current resources are:\n* Wheat: 16 (Value: 5)\n* Wood: 19 (Value: 11)\n* Sheep: 21 (Value: 16)\n* Brick: 5 (Value: 21)\n* Ore: 14 (Value: 32)\n\nMy total current value is:\n(16 * 5) + (19 * 11) + (21 * 16) + (5 * 21) + (14 * 32)\n= 80 + 209 + 336 + 105 + 448\n= 1178\n\nMy goal is to increase my total resource value. This means I want to trade away lower-value resources for higher-value resources, or trade resources I have in surplus for resources I need more of (even if slightly lower value per unit) as long as the net value increases.\n\nThe current offer from Player 0 is: `[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's evaluate this offer:\n*   **Offered by Player 0:** 3 Sheep.\n    *   Value of 3 Sheep = 3 * 16 = 48\n*   **Requested by Player 0 (I would receive):** 1 Ore.\n    *   Value of 1 Ore = 1 * 32 = 32\n\nIf I accept this offer, I give away 3 Sheep (value 48) and receive 1 Ore (value 32). This is a net loss of 48 - 32 = 16 in value for me. This offer clearly decreases my total value.\n\nTherefore, I should reject this offer.\n\nMy previous offer to Player 0 (2 Ore -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood) was rejected. Let's re-evaluate that.\n*   **Offered by me:** 2 Ore (Value: 2 * 32 = 64)\n*   **Requested by me:** 3 Brick (Value: 3 * 21 = 63) + 1 Wood (Value: 1 * 11 = 11)\n    *   Total requested value: 63 + 11 = 74\n\nIn my previous offer, I would have given away 64 value to receive 74 value, a net gain of 10. This was a good offer for me. Player 0 rejecting it suggests they either don't have enough Brick/Wood, or they value their Brick/Wood higher than I do, or they simply didn't see the benefit to them.\n\nConsidering Player 0's current offer (3 Sheep for 1 Ore), they seem to want Ore. They're offering a poor trade from my perspective. This indicates they might be desperate for Ore, or they highly value Ore.\n\nI have 14 Ore (Value 32) and 21 Sheep (Value 16). I have a lot of Sheep. Ore is my highest value per unit resource right now.\n\nI want to acquire more high-value resources like Ore or Brick, or shed some low-value resources like Wheat or potentially some Sheep if I can get a good deal.\n\nGiven Player 0 wants Ore, I should try to capitalize on that. Their current offer is bad for me. I need to make an offer that is good for me but still enticing enough for Player 0 to consider.\n\nPerhaps I can offer a smaller amount of Ore or combine it with a lower-value resource to get a better return for myself. Or, I can offer my Sheep for something I value more.\n\nLet's consider what I want. Brick is 21, Ore is 32. Wood is 11, Wheat is 5, Sheep is 16.\nI have 5 Brick, which is a low quantity for a high-value resource. Getting more Brick would be good.\n\nPlayer 0 offered 3 Brick for 2 Ore earlier (which I rejected because I deemed 3 Brick not enough for 2 Ore considering 2 Ore is 64 value and 3 Brick is 63 value).\nPlayer 0 offered 3 Sheep for 1 Ore just now (which is a bad deal for me). This reinforces they want Ore.\n\nWhat if I offer some Sheep for some Brick? I have 21 Sheep, so I can spare some.\nIf I offer: 3 Sheep (Value 48) for 2 Brick (Value 42). That's a loss for me.\nIf I offer: 2 Sheep (Value 32) for 1 Brick (Value 21). That's a loss for me.\n\nThe best trades are usually those where I give away many low-value items for fewer high-value items, and the net value increases.\n\nLet's try to get more high-value items like Brick or Ore.\nPlayer 0 keeps asking for Ore. This is my leverage. I should only give Ore if I get a good return.\n\nTheir original offer was 3 Brick for 2 Ore (meaning they wanted 2 Ore and offered 3 Brick). I rejected this because I wanted more than 3 Brick for 2 Ore. My counter was 2 Ore for 3 Brick and 1 Wood (total 74 value for 64 value provided). They rejected.\n\nNow they're desperate, offering 3 Sheep for 1 Ore. This is a very bad offer for me.\n\nLet's try to get Brick or Ore for my Sheep or Wheat.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Sheep.\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of Sheep for Ore, but at a better rate than their terrible offer?\n\nIf I offer 4 Sheep (Value 64) for 2 Ore (Value 64). This is neutral value.\nIf I offer 5 Sheep (Value 80) for 2 Ore (Value 64). Still not ideal.\n\nI need to gain value.\nI have 21 Sheep. If I trade some Sheep for Brick:\nOffer: 4 Sheep (Value 64) -> 3 Brick (Value 63). Loss of 1.\nOffer: 5 Sheep (Value 80) -> 4 Brick (Value 84). Gain of 4. This is a possibility.\nI'm giving up 5 Sheep (80 value) for 4 Brick (84 value). I have 21 Sheep, so losing 5 isn't a problem. I currently have 5 Brick, so gaining 4 Brick is significant.\n\nLet's make an offer that gains me value.\nMy Sheep quantity is high so shedding some is fine, especially for a higher value resource.\nI could try for a similar trade to what Player 0 initially offered (3 Brick for 2 Ore) but reversed, where I provide Sheep.\n\nI currently have 14 Ore. I could part with some if the return is good.\nPlayer 0 is explicitly trying to get Ore. They even made a bad offer for it. This suggests they *really* need Ore.\n\nI could try to sell some Ore at a premium.\nInstead of offering 2 Ore for 3 Brick and 1 Wood, I could ask for more.\nBut Player 0 rejected that offer.\n\nLet's consider their desperation for Ore. What if I offer less Ore for a higher value back?\nOr, what if I offer my high quantity Sheep for their Ore? Currently, 3 Sheep = 48, 1 Ore = 32. This is bad. I'd want the opposite.\nI want to give less, get more. Or give low value, get high value.\n\nIf I offer 3 Ore (value 96) for some really good stuff:\nLike 3 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Wood (5*21 + 2*11 = 105 + 22 = 127). That's a huge gain. They probably won't accept.\n\nLet's try to leverage my Sheep surplus and their potential need for other resources, or their stated need for Ore.\nIf I want to get Ore, I have to give something high value.\nIf I want to give Sheep, I probably get Sheep or lower value resources, unless they are desperate for Sheep.\n\nLet's re-evaluate their strong demand for Ore. If they need Ore, I can give them Ore, but only for a significant profit for me.\nMy previous offer: 2 Ore (64) -> 3 Brick (63), 1 Wood (11). Net gain of 10. They rejected.\nThis implied to me that either they didn't have 3 Brick or 1 Wood to spare, or they valued their Brick/Wood more highly, or they didn't see the value.\n\nNow their current offer is 3 Sheep (48) for 1 Ore (32). This is horrible for me.\nI have 21 Sheep. I have 14 Ore.\n\nLet's make an offer tailored to getting more value for my very valuable Ore, or to offload my abundant Sheep for something I need more.\n\nGiven Player 0 rejected my excellent offer of 2 Ore for 3 Brick and 1 Wood, perhaps they truly do not have enough Brick. They also offered 3 Brick for 2 Ore earlier, so they must have *some* Brick.\n\nI'm thinking of making an offer from my side.\nI have a lot of Sheep and Wheat. I have few Brick.\nI want to increase my total value, hopefully by getting more Brick or Ore.\n\nWhat if I offer Sheep for Brick?\nOffer: 5 Sheep (Value 80) -> 4 Brick (Value 84). Net gain of 4. This is a decent offer for me. I have 21 Sheep, so I can spare 5. I only have 5 Brick, so gaining 4 is great.\n\nIs this likely to be accepted by Player 0?\nThey gave me 3 Sheep for 1 Ore. Meaning they value 1 Ore more than 3 Sheep.\nIf I offer them 5 Sheep for 4 Brick, they are giving up 84 value to gain 80 value. They are losing value. They won't accept. This is a bad trade for them.\n\nMy best strategy is to exploit their stated desire for Ore.\nSince my previous offer of 2 Ore for 3 Brick, 1 Wood was rejected, they might not have 3 Brick.\nWhat if I reduce the requested Brick?\nWhat about 1 Ore for 2 Brick? (1 Ore = 32, 2 Brick = 42). Gain of 10. This is good for me.\nThey originally offered 3 Brick for 2 Ore (meaning they'd get 2 Ore). So they valued 2 Ore less than 3 Brick.\nNow I'm offering 1 Ore for 2 Brick. This is more expensive for them per Ore than their initial offer. They'd probably reject.\n\nLet me think about what I value least and what I have most of that can be exchanged for some gain.\nSheep. I have 21 Sheep. Value 16.\nI also have 16 Wheat. Value 5. This is my lowest value per unit.\n\nPerhaps I can offer some Wheat. But usually, low-value offers only get you low-value items.\nLet's make an offer that is *slightly* favorable to me, or at least break-even for them.\n\nConsider the values: Ore 32 > Brick 21 > Sheep 16 > Wood 11 > Wheat 5.\n\nPlayer 0 wants Ore. I have 14 Ore.\nIf I offer 1 Ore (value 32), what do I want in return?\nTo gain value, I need more than 32.\n2 Brick (42). Gain of 10.\n3 Sheep (48). Gain of 16.\n1 Brick + 1 Wood (21+11 = 32). Break even.\n1 Brick + 2 Wheat (21+10 = 31). Loss.\n\nHow about I aim for a trade that is profitable for me and not too egregious for them, especially given their clear need for Ore?\nLet's try to get Brick for Ore.\n1 Ore -> 2 Brick: Player 0 offered 3 Brick for 2 Ore. My offer implies Player 0 would give me 2 Brick for 1 Ore. So 4 Brick for 2 Ore. They initially only wanted to give 3 Brick for 2 Ore. So this is worse for them.\n\nPlayer 0 is offering 3 Sheep for 1 Ore, which is bad for me. This means they are effectively valuing 1 Ore at 48 (because they're willing to pay 3 Sheep for it). I should aim for a higher return for my Ore.\n\nMy offer: 1 Ore (Value 32) -> 3 Sheep (Value 48)\nThis is the reverse of their offer. This means I would gain 16 value for 1 Ore. Extremely good for me.\nThey would be getting 1 Ore, which they want, and losing 3 Sheep, which they just tried to give me. It's a straight swap of directions.\nThey might accept this because they want Ore and they just offered me the same amount of Sheep for it.\n\nLet's analyze this proposal:\nMy offer: `[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep]`\n*   **I offer:** 1 Ore. Value: 32.\n*   **I receive:** 3 Sheep. Value: 48.\n*   **Net change for me:** +16 value.\n\nFrom Player 0's perspective:\n*   **They receive:** 1 Ore. Value: 32.\n*   **They give:** 3 Sheep. Value: 48.\n*   **Net change for them:** -16 value.\n\nThis is the exact opposite of the current offer. Player 0 rejected my previous good offer. Player 0 then proposed a horrible offer for me because they want Ore.\nIf I propose this, they essentially lose value. They might not accept. It's too explicitly a loss for them.\n\nI need to make an offer that feels like a good deal for them, or at least a fair one, while still profiting me. This is hard when values are fixed.\n\nWhat if I offer something else from my abundant resources for their Ore.\nWheat is low value.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (Value 25) -> 1 Ore (Value 32). This is a loss for me.\n10 Wheat (Value 50) -> 1 Ore (Value 32). This is a bad trade for them. They lose 18 value.\n\nPerhaps I should aim for a smaller gain for myself, but a more palatable offer for Player 0.\nPlayer 0 wants Ore. I have 14 Ore.\n\nLet's reconsider my previous offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood.\nMy profit was 10. Their loss was 10. They rejected it.\nThis suggests they are not willing to take a straight value loss.\n\nWhat if I offer something they explicitly want *for something else they want* but with a slight twist?\nThey want Ore. What else might they want? Or what can I get for cheap from them?\n\nIf Player 0 is desperate for Ore, I can ask for something good.\nHow about 1 Ore for 1 Brick and 1 Sheep?\n1 Ore (32) <-> 1 Brick (21) + 1 Sheep (16) = 37.\nNet gain for me: 5.\nThis is a small gain, but potentially more acceptable to Player 0.\nFrom Player 0's perspective, they give 37 value to get 32 value. So they lose 5 value. This is still a loss for them.\n\nThis setup is difficult, because any trade I accept that increases my value will decrease theirs, and vice versa.\nThe best trades are when one player values a resource differently than the other, or when one player has a huge surplus.\n\nI have a large surplus of Sheep (21) and Wheat (16).\nI have a low quantity of Brick (5).\n\nLet's try to get Brick.\nWhat if I offer Sheep and Wood for Brick?\nOffer: 2 Sheep (32) + 1 Wood (11) = 43 -> 2 Brick (42). I would lose 1 value here. Not good.\nOffer: 3 Sheep (48) + 1 Wood (11) = 59 -> 3 Brick (63). I gain 4 value.\nThis means I give up 3 Sheep and 1 Wood (total value 59) to get 3 Brick (total value 63).\nThis is a positive value trade for me (+4).\nFrom Player 0's perspective: They give 3 Brick (63) to get 3 Sheep (48) + 1 Wood (11) = 59. They lose 4 value.\n\nThis is a subtle loss for Player 0, similar to my previous rejected offer.\nHowever, Player 0 has indicated they want Ore, but previously rejected an offer of 2 Ore for 3 Brick and 1 Wood. This implies they might be short on Brick.\n\nLet's ignore their previous rejections and focus on their strong desire for Ore.\nThey offered an abysmal rate of 3 Sheep for 1 Ore. This explicitly tells me they value 1 Ore at least at 48 (because they're willing to pay 3 Sheep for it).\nMy Ore is valued at 32 game value. So they are implicitly valuing my Ore 16 points higher than the game value. This is my leverage.\n\nI should try to sell my Ore to them for a gain, but not too aggressively that they reject.\nTheir implicit valuation of Ore is 48.\nMy actual value: 1 Ore = 32.\nIf I can get anything worth more than 32 but less than 48+epsilon, it might be acceptable.\n\nLet's offer 1 Ore for an amount of resources that gives me a small gain.\nIf I offer 1 Ore (32) for 1 Brick (21) and 1 Wood (11). Total 32. This is neutral for me. No gain.\nIf I offer 1 Ore (32) for 2 Sheep (32). Neutral. No gain. But if they're desperate, they might accept this.\nI have plenty of sheep. So trading 1 Ore for 2 Sheep is not good for me since I want higher value resources.\n\nWhat about 1 Ore for 1 Brick (21) and 3 Wheat (5*3=15). Total 36. This is a gain of +4 for me.\nFrom Player 0's perspective: They give 1 Brick (21) and 3 Wheat (15) = 36. They get 1 Ore (32). Net loss of 4 for them.\nThis is similar to my previous rejected offer's value exchange, but with a different resource mix.\n1 Brick and 3 Wheat seems like a reasonable trade for 1 Ore if they truly need the Ore.\nI have few Brick (5), getting 1 is good. I have many Wheat (16), so giving 3 is fine.\n\nI think this is a plausible offer. It gives me a small value gain (+4), provides them with the Ore they seem to want, and takes some of my lower-value/abundant resources.\n\nFinal Decision:\nMy current total value: 1178.\nOffer: 1 Ore (Value 32) -> 1 Brick (Value 21), 3 Wheat (Value 15).\nIf accepted:\nMy resources:\nQty of Ore: 14 -> 13\nQty of Brick: 5 -> 6\nQty of Wheat: 16 -> 13\n\nNew total value calculation:\nOld: (16 * 5) + (19 * 11) + (21 * 16) + (5 * 21) + (14 * 32) = 1178\nNew: (13 * 5) + (19 * 11) + (21 * 16) + (6 * 21) + (13 * 32)\n= 65 + 209 + 336 + 126 + 416\n= 1152. This is a loss. My math was incorrect.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the proposed trade: 1 Ore for 1 Brick + 3 Wheat.\nValue given: 1 Ore = 32\nValue received: 1 Brick (21) + 3 Wheat (3*5=15) = 36\nNet gain = +4. This is correct.\nWhy did my total value change come out negative?\nAh, the quantities.\n\nInitial total value: (16 * 5) + (19 * 11) + (21 * 16) + (5 * 21) + (14 * 32) = 80 + 209 + 336 + 105 + 448 = 1178.\n\nIf I give 1 Ore, my Ore value becomes 13 * 32 = 416. (was 448) -> -32\nIf I gain 1 Brick, my Brick value becomes 6 * 21 = 126. (was 105) -> +21\nIf I gain 3 Wheat, my Wheat value becomes 13 * 5 = 65. (was 80) -> -15. ERROR, I'm GIVING 3 Wheat from my perspective, not receiving.\n\nMy Offer: `[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 3 Wheat]` - this means I OFFER 1 Ore, and I REQUEST 1 Brick and 3 Wheat.\nSo:\nI GIVE 1 Ore (value 32).\nI RECEIVE 1 Brick (value 21) and 3 Wheat (value 15).\nTotal value received = 21 + 15 = 36.\nNet game value `36 - 32 = +4`. This is a gain for me.\n\nThe quantities in my inventory will change as follows:\nWheat: 16 -> 16 + 3 = 19 (if I requested Wheat)\nNo, I'm offering 2 Ore -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood (previous context).\nMy current proposed offer is 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 3 Wheat.\nThis means I give 1 Ore, and receive 1 Brick and 3 Wheat.\n\nLet's confirm the quantities from the Player 0's offer I'm responding to:\nPlayer 0: Offered items: 3 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore.\nThis means Player 0 is *giving* 3 Sheep and *wants* 1 Ore.\n\nOkay, back to my turn. I need to make an offer.\nMy proposed offer: `[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 3 Wheat]`\nThis means I am offering 1 Ore.\nI am requesting 1 Brick and 3 Wheat.\n\nMy resources if this trade occurs:\nWheat: 16 -> 16 + 3 = 19 (Value 19 * 5 = 95)\nWood: 19 (Value 19 * 11 = 209)\nSheep: 21 (Value 21 * 16 = 336)\nBrick: 5 -> 5 + 1 = 6 (Value 6 * 21 = 126)\nOre: 14 -> 14 - 1 = 13 (Value 13 * 32 = 416)\n\nOld total value = 1178\nNew total value = 95 + 209 + 336 + 126 + 416 = 1182\n\nGain = 1182 - 1178 = 4. This is correct.\n\nI am offering a highly valued resource (Ore) to acquire a higher per piece value (Brick) and a low-value resource (Wheat) that I should have plenty of (or they do). This trade provides me with a simple gain of 4 value.\nIt gives Player 0 the Ore they clearly want (given their terrible previous offer) and they are providing me with 1 Brick and 3 Wheat.\nTheir side: Give 1 Brick (21) + 3 Wheat (15) = 36 value.\nReceive 1 Ore (32 value).\nThey lose 4 value.\nThis is similar to my previous rejected offer in terms of value change (-10 vs -4). Perhaps a smaller loss is more palatable to them.\n\nThis seems like the best option given the circumstances.\nI have a surplus of Wheat and Sheep, fewer Brick. Getting Brick is good.\nLeveraging their desire for Ore is crucial.\n\nOther option: Offer 2 Sheep for 1 Ore. This is bad for me. I lose value.\nLet's make my proposed offer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"Offer\",\n  \"offered_items\": {\n    \"Ore\": 1\n  },\n  \"requested_items\": {\n    \"Brick\": 1,\n    \"Wheat\": 3\n  }\n}\n```",

This directly aligns with my goal of increasing total value.\n2.  **Resource Quantities:** I have 14 Ore and 5 Brick. I have an abundance of Ore and a scarcity of Brick. Trading away Ore for Brick increases my less abundant resource, which can be beneficial for future trades or specific game mechanics (though not explicitly stated, it's a general competitive game principle).\n3.  **Opponent's Intent:** Player 0 seems to be trying to get Ore. They have made previous offers for Ore. This suggests Ore is valuable to them.\n4.  **Past Trades:**\n    *   Player 0 offered 3 Brick -> 2 Ore (Rejected by me) - This was a negative trade for me (3*21=63 vs 2*32=64, loss of 1).\n    *   I offered 2 Ore -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood (Rejected by Player 0) - This was a positive trade for me (2*32=64 vs (3*21 + 1*11=74), gain of 10). Player 0 rejected it, suggesting they undervalued the Wood or didn't agree with the total cost.\n    *   Player 0 offered 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore (Rejected by me) - This was a negative trade for me (3*16=48 vs 1*32=32, loss of 16).\n    *   I offered 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore (Rejected by Player 0) - This was a positive trade for me (3*16=48 vs 1*32=32, gain of 16). Player 0 rejected it.\n    *   Now Player 0 offers 2 Brick -> 1 Ore.\n\nComparing the current offer (2 Brick for 1 Ore) with previous offers:\nPlayer 0's previous offer for Ore was 3 Brick for 2 Ore (value 63 for 64, minor loss for me).\nThis current offer is 2 Brick for 1 Ore (value 42 for 32, gain of 10 for me).\nPlayer 0 is offering a better deal for me now, indicating their need for Ore might be increasing, or they are becoming more flexible.\n\nGiven that this offer provides a clear positive value change for me (+10), and I have plenty of Ore to spare, and I am low on Brick, I should accept this trade.\n\nMy current action is to accept the incoming offer.\n\n[Accept]",

      "response": "My current resources and their values are:\n- Wheat: 16 (Value: 5) Total: 80\n- Wood: 19 (Value: 11) Total: 209\n- Sheep: 21 (Value: 16) Total: 336\n- Brick: 5 (Value: 21) Total: 105\n- Ore: 14 (Value: 32) Total: 448\nTotal Value: 1178\n\nThe current offer from Player 0 is: `[Offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Ore]`\n\nLet's evaluate this offer:\n- **Offered by Player 0 (what I would give up):**\n    - 4 Sheep: 4 * 16 = 64\n    - 1 Wood: 1 * 11 = 11\n    - Total value I would give up: 64 + 11 = 75\n\n- **Requested by Player 0 (what I would receive):**\n    - 2 Ore: 2 * 32 = 64\n\n- **Value Change:** 64 (received) - 75 (given) = -11\n\nThis offer would decrease my total resource value by 11. My goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Therefore, I should reject this offer.\n\nNext, I need to consider what trade I want to propose.\n\nA common theme in Player 0's offers has been requesting Ore. They seem to value Ore highly, or need it. I also value Ore highly, but I have a good quantity of it (14). I have previously tried to trade Ore for Brick and Wood, but Player 0 has rejected those. Player 0 has also offered me Wheat and Brick for Ore, which I accepted because they were favorable.\n\nPlayer 0's last offer involved Sheep and Wood for Ore. Since they value Ore, I might be able to get a better deal for it.\n\nLet's look at my current surplus and needs, keeping in mind relative values:\n- Sheep (16 value) and Wheat (5 value) are my lowest value resources. I have a decent quantity of Sheep (21) and a lot of Wheat (16).\n- Brick (21 value) and Wood (11 value) are mid-tier. I have very little Brick (5) and a good amount of Wood (19).\n- Ore (32 value) is my highest value resource, and I still have 14.\n\nPlayer 0 is clearly looking for Ore. I should continue trying to trade my lower value resources for higher value ones, or trade Ore for a net gain.\n\nPrevious successful trades for me:\n- Player 0: Offered 2 Brick (42 value) -> Requested 1 Ore (32 value). Net +10. (I gave up 1 Ore)\n- Player 0: Offered 2 Wheat (10 value) -> Requested 1 Ore (32 value). Net +22. (I gave up 1 Ore). This was a mistake. I think I miscalculated in the moment. I received 2 Wheat (10) for 1 Ore (32). That was -22 value for me. I need to be more careful.\n\nLet's re-evaluate all past trades to ensure correct tracking:\nInitial: Wheat:16(80), Wood:19(209), Sheep:21(336), Brick:5(105), Ore:14(448). Total:1178\n\n1.  P0 offered 3 Brick (63) -> 2 Ore (64). I rejected. Player 0 rejected. (-1 value for me). Correct.\n2.  I offered 2 Ore (64) -> 3 Brick (63), 1 Wood (11). Player 0 rejected. (+10 value for me). I asked for too much, probably.\n3.  P0 offered 3 Sheep (48) -> 1 Ore (32). I rejected. (-16 value for me). Correct.\n4.  I offered 3 Sheep (48) -> 1 Ore (32). P0 rejected. (+16 for me). I was asking to give up 48 value for 32 value, which is bad for me. I meant to offer 1 Ore for 3 Sheep. I made a mistake in the previous offers in my head.\n\nLet's re-read the previous offers and actions carefully.\n\"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Brick -> Requested items: 2 Ore\" => P0 gives 3B, wants 2O. My perspective: give 2O (64), get 3B (63). Net -1. I rejected. Correct.\n\n\"Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 2 Ore -> Requested items: 3 Brick, 1 Wood\" => I give 2O (64), want 3B (63) + 1W (11) = 74. Net +10. P0 rejected. Correct.\n\n\"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore\" => P0 gives 3S (48), wants 1O (32). My perspective: give 1O (32), get 3S (48). Net +16. I rejected. WHY DID I REJECT THIS? This was a beneficial trade. I must have miscalculated or misunderstood the \"Offered items\" vs \"Requested items\" from *Player 0's perspective* when evaluating. This was a good trade for me! Oh no.\n\n\"Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 3 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore\" => I give 3S (48), want 1O (32). Net -16. P0 rejected. Correct (for them). I made a bad offer here.\n\n\"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 2 Brick -> Requested items: 1 Ore\" => P0 gives 2B (42), wants 1O (32). My perspective: give 1O (32), get 2B (42). Net +10. I accepted.\nMy resources after this trade:\nWheat: 16 (80)\nWood: 19 (209)\nSheep: 21 (336)\nBrick: 5 + 2 = 7 (147)\nOre: 14 - 1 = 13 (416)\nTotal Value: 1188 (1178 + 10)\n\n\"Player 1 made no new trade offer.\"\n\n\"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 2 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\" => P0 gives 2W (10), wants 1O (32). My perspective: give 1O (32), get 2W (10). Net -22. I accepted.\nThis means I have made two bad trades in a row by accepting without careful calculation. This is a critical error. My total value is decreasing.\n\nMy resources after this trade:\nWheat: 16 + 2 = 18 (90)\nWood: 19 (209)\nSheep: 21 (336)\nBrick: 7 (147)\nOre: 13 - 1 = 12 (384)\nTotal Value: 1166 (1188 - 22)\n\n**My current resources and their values are:**\n- Wheat: 18 (Value: 5) Total: 90\n- Wood: 19 (Value: 11) Total: 209\n- Sheep: 21 (Value: 16) Total: 336\n- Brick: 7 (Value: 21) Total: 147\n- Ore: 12 (Value: 32) Total: 384\n**Current Total Value: 90 + 209 + 336 + 147 + 384 = 1166**\nMy initial value was 1178. My value has decreased. I must be more vigilant!\n\n**Review of the current offer:**\nPlayer 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 4 Sheep, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 2 Ore\n- **Offered by Player 0 (what I would give up):**\n    - 4 Sheep: 4 * 16 = 64\n    - 1 Wood: 1 * 11 = 11\n    - Total value I would give up: 75\n- **Requested by Player 0 (what I would receive):**\n    - 2 Ore: 2 * 32 = 64\n- **Value Change:** 64 (received) - 75 (given) = -11. This is a bad trade for me. I reject.\n\n**My Plan Moving Forward:**\n1.  **Prioritize increasing total value.** No trade is better than a bad trade.\n2.  **Strictly calculate value changes for all offers (incoming and outgoing).**\n    - Incoming offers from Player 0: Calculate (Value of items P0 gives) - (Value of items P0 requests from me). If positive, consider. If negative, reject.\n    - My outgoing offers: Calculate (Value of items I request) - (Value of items I offer). If positive, propose. If negative, do not propose.\n3.  **Analyze Player 0's likely needs/desires:** Player 0 repeatedly asks for Ore. They might be willing to overpay for it. I have 12 Ore, which is still a decent amount.\n4.  **Identify my \"cheap\" resources:** Wheat (5), Wood (11), Sheep (16). I have a lot of Wheat (18), a lot of Wood (19), and a lot of Sheep (21).\n5.  **Identify my \"expensive\" resources:** Brick (21), Ore (32). I have 7 Brick and 12 Ore. I have few Brick.\n\nMy strategy should be to:\n- Trade my low-value, high-quantity resources (Wheat, Sheep, Wood) for high-value resources (Brick, Ore), especially Brick as I have so little.\n- If Player 0 is desperate for Ore, I can offer a small amount of Ore for a significant return in value, as long as it's a net positive for me. I still have a decent amount of Ore.\n\nLet's try to get some Brick or more Ore in exchange for my lower value resources, or offer Ore if the deal is very good.\nPlayer 0 has previously offered 3 Sheep (48) for 1 Ore (32). This implies they are willing to *give* 48 value to *get* 32 value, making it a +16 trade for me. I should have accepted it.\n\nI have 21 Sheep. If I offer 3 Sheep again for 1 Ore (my previous offer that Player 0 rejected, but which was actually bad for me), I would be giving 48 value for 32 value. Still a bad trade for me.\n\nI need to offer something UP to Player 0 to get Ore.\nLet's try to trade my low-value resources for something Player 0 has in surplus, or for Ore if I can get a good deal.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of low-value items for 1 Ore?\n- 6 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (32)? (+2 value). I have 18 wheat. This is a fair trade. Might be too little for P0.\n- 2 Wood (22) for 1 Ore (32)? (+10 value). I have 19 wood. This is good.\n- 2 Sheep (32) for 1 Ore (32)? (0 value). I have 21 sheep. This is a fair trade.\n\nI want to make a trade that benefits me and is appealing to Player 0. Player 0 seems to want Ore.\nLet's try to get Brick, since I have so few. Player 0 has previously offered Brick for Ore.\n\nCurrent resources: Wheat:18, Wood:19, Sheep:21, Brick:7, Ore:12.\n\nWhat if I offer a quantity of Sheep for Brick or Ore?\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (48) for 2 Brick (42). Net -6. Bad.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (48) for 1 Ore (32). Net -16. Bad.\n\nWhat if I offer a small amount of Ore for a lot of a lower value resource, but where I gain much value?\nPlayer 0 previously tried to get my Ore. I can try to give up 1 Ore if I get high value in return.\nI have 12 Ore.\n\nLet's reconsider what P0 valued highly (their requests) and what they offered me.\nP0 requests: 2 Ore, 1 Ore (repeatedly).\nP0 offers: 3 Brick, 3 Sheep, 2 Brick, 2 Wheat, 4 Sheep + 1 Wood.\n\nP0 seems to have: Sheep, Brick, Wheat, Wood.\nP0 needs: Ore.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep (21) and Wood (19).\nLet's try to trade Sheep for Brick or Ore, ensuring I gain value.\n\nIf I offer: 1 Ore (32 value)\nI want to receive more than 32 value.\nPossible requests:\n- 2 Brick (42 value) -> Net +10. (Previously accepted).\n- 3 Brick (63 value) -> Net +31. This is a very good trade for me, maybe too high?\n- 1 Wood (11), 1 Brick (21), and 1 Sheep (16) -> 11+21+16 = 48 value -> Net +16.\n\nLet's try to get Brick because I have so few.\nI will propose: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]\nValue I give: 1 Ore (32)\nValue I receive: 3 Brick (3 * 21 = 63)\nNet gain: 63 - 32 = +31. This is a substantial gain for me.\n\nPlayer 0 might be willing to pay a premium for Ore, given their previous attempts to acquire it. They have offered 3 Sheep (48) for 1 Ore (32), which was a +16 for me. So asking for 3 Brick (+31 for me) might be too much, but worth a shot. This seems like a good starting point for me to maximize my value from the desperate Player 0.\n\nIf P0 rejects, I can consider a slightly lower offer, such as 1 Ore for 2 Brick and 1 Wood (2*21 + 1*11 = 42+11 = 53 value), which is a +21 gain.\nBut for now, I will try for the best possible gain.\n\nCurrent state:\nWheat: 18 (90)\nWood: 19 (209)\nSheep: 21 (336)\nBrick: 7 (147)\nOre: 12 (384)\nTotal Value: 1166\n\nThinking step-by-step:\n1.  **Incoming Offer Analysis:** Player 0's offer [Offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Ore].\n    - Value offered by P0 (what I give): 4 Sheep (4*16=64) + 1 Wood (1*11=11) = 75.\n    - Value requested by P0 (what I get): 2 Ore (2*32=64).\n    - Net Change for me: 64 (received) - 75 (given) = -11. This reduces my total value.\n2.  **Decision on Incoming Offer:** Deny.\n3.  **My Offer Strategy:**\n    - Goal: Increase total resource value.\n    - Identify Player 0's likely need: Ore.\n    - Identify my surpluses/resources I'm willing to trade strategically: I have a good amount of Ore (12), but it's high value. I want to improve my total value. Perhaps trading a small amount of Ore at a significant profit. I also have high quantities of Sheep, Wood, and Wheat, but their low value makes it harder to trade them directly for high value.\n    - Previous P0 behavior: P0 has tried to get 1-2 Ore. They also previously offered 3 Sheep (48) for 1 Ore (32), which would have been +16 for me. This shows they are willing to overpay for Ore.\n    - Target good value for me: My value for 1 Ore is 32. I want to receive more than 32 value.\n    - Resource I want: Brick (I have very few, 7).\n    - Proposed Trade: 1 Ore for 3 Brick.\n        - Value I give: 1 Ore = 32.\n        - Value I receive: 3 Brick = 3 * 21 = 63.\n        - Net profit: 63 - 32 = +31. This is a very beneficial trade for me. It might be rejected as being too much for Player 0, but it leverages Player 0's perceived need for Ore.\n\nFinal Decision: Deny Player 0's offer and make my own offer.\n\n**Action:**\n1.  Deny the current offer `[Offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Ore]`\n2.  Propose `[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"Deny\"\n}\n```",
