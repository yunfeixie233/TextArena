      "response": "### Current Position Analyzed:\n- White has played [e2e4], advancing the pawn to control the center.\n- There are no immediate threats from White, as all Black pieces are still on their starting squares.\n- Black needs to focus on development and controlling the center.\n\n### Immediate Moves Available to Black:\n1. Develop the knight to control the center: \n   - [g8f6] (which attacks the e4 pawn)\n   - [b8c6] (which develops the knight but does not directly challenge the center).\n   \n2. Pawn moves that can support development:\n   - [e7e6] (preparing to develop the dark-squared bishop).\n   - [d7d5] (an aggressive counter towards White\u2019s central pawn, although it may go unsupported).\n\n### Strategy:\n- Developing pieces towards the center allows for greater control and pressure.\n- The knight on f6 applies immediate pressure on the e4 pawn while also preparing for further development.\n- This opens lines without prematurely moving pawns that could limit piece mobility later.\n\n### Tactical Opportunities:\n- Currently, no tactical opportunities such as forks or pins arise in this situation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter considering potential moves, I will proceed with developing my knight to f6 to apply pressure on White\u2019s central pawn and advance my position.\n\nMy move will be: \n[g8f6]",
