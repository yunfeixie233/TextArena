The valid moves for White now include several options for development and central control.\n\nFirst, let's consider the moves made so far:\n- White initially played [g1h3].\n- Black responded with [e7e5].\n- White then played [d2d4].\n- Black responded with [d7d5].\n\nGiven the current position, we need to evaluate the valid moves:\n[h3g5], [h3f4], [h3g1], [h1g1], [e1d2], [d1d3], [d1d2], [c1h6], [c1g5], [c1f4], [c1e3], [c1d2], [b1c3], [b1a3], [b1d2], [d4e5], [g2g3], [f2f3], [e2e3], [c2c3], [b2b3], [a2a3], [g2g4], [f2f4], [e2e4], [c2c4], [b2b4], [a2a4].\n\nLet's analyze the position:\n- The move [d4e5] is an interesting option as it captures Black's central pawn, potentially opening up the center and creating a passed pawn or a strong central pawn for White. However, it also opens lines for Black's pieces.\n\nConsidering the development and the tension in the center, [b1c3] is a solid move as it develops the knight, supports the d4 pawn, and prepares for further development.\n\nLet's play [b1c3].\n\nMy move is: [b1c3]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Illegal move: d7d5.
