      "response": "[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Identify any immediate threats from Player X. X has only one mark at 0. Check if X has two in a row \u2014 no. But note: X occupies corner 0, O occupies center 4. If X gets 8 (opposite corner), it creates a diagonal threat (0-4-8). Must block that possibility if needed later.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Evaluate current opportunities for O to build winning lines. O has center (4). Best chance is to take a corner \u2014 corners give three possible win paths from center. Ideal move: take a corner that pairs with center for diagonal or row/column. Candidate corners: 2 (top-right), 6 (bottom-left), 8 (bottom-right). Avoid 0 \u2014 already taken.\n\nBut note: if O takes 8, and X took 0, then diagonal 0-4-8 is blocked, but O gains strong presence. Also, taking 2 or 6 opens potential forks.\n\nBut which corner best enables fork potential? Consider that O in 8 and later 2 creates top row threat and right column threat \u2014 could lead to double threat.\n\nWait \u2014 better idea: if O takes a corner *adjacent* to X\u2019s corner, not opposite, it avoids symmetry and may open earlier win. But actual strongest path is to take a corner that allows two potential lines to develop.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: After X takes corner 0, O should aim for another corner to maximize influence. Center + corner gives O control of one diagonal and parts of row/column. Remaining corners: 2, 6, 8. Each is strong. However, taking **8 (opposite corner)** is strategically strongest \u2014 it denies X the diagonal (0-4-8), asserts counter-control, and maintains initiative. This is a classic book move: when opponent takes a corner, responding with opposite corner after controlling center is ideal.\n\nMoreover, occupying 8 gives O:  \n- Diagonal: 2-4-6 (no, wait \u2014 8 connects 0-4-8 diagonal? No \u2014 O is at 4 and 8, so 0-4-8 is O-O-X, which is good \u2014 blocks X from completing it)  \nWait: 0 is X, 4 is O, 8 is candidate. If O takes 8, then diagonal 0-4-8 becomes X-O-O \u2014 not a win for O, but prevents X from ever winning that diagonal. However, O doesn't gain an immediate threat.\n\nBut more importantly, O wants to build toward **own** threats.\n\nBetter: if O takes **2** or **6**, and later secures another corner, can create two-in-a-row with open third.\n\nLet\u2019s reevaluate:\n\nIf O takes **2 (top-right)**:  \n- Then O controls top row (X-O-O) \u2014 not a threat, but future.  \n- O also controls right column (2-5-8) \u2014 open.  \n- And diagonal 2-4-6 \u2014 possible.\n\nSimilarly, if O takes **6 (bottom-left)**:  \n- Left column (0-3-6) \u2014 X and O, but 3 open.  \n- Bottom row (6-7-8) \u2014 open.  \n- Diagonal 6-4-2 \u2014 possible.\n\nBut here's the key: **corner 8 (bottom-right)** is best because:\n- It\u2019s opposite to X\u2019s 0, denying the full diagonal.\n- It gives O strong presence in bottom row and right column.\n- It avoids crowding with X at top-left.\n\nBut wait \u2014 in standard optimal play, after:\n- O1: center (4)\n- X1: corner (0)\nThen **O2 should take the opposite corner (8)** to maximize control and reduce X's counterplay.\n\nYes \u2014 this is well-established in Tic Tac Toe theory.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: By taking 8, O blocks the 0-4-8 diagonal from ever being used by X and secures a strong corner. This prevents future X fork attempts that rely on symmetry.\n\nNo other move defends against X\u2019s potential as solidly.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: From corner 8 and center 4, O can aim to complete:\n- Diagonal 2-4-6? No \u2014 8 is not on that.\n- Right column: 2-5-8 \u2014 yes.\n- Bottom row: 6-7-8 \u2014 yes.\nSo O can threaten two different lines (bottom row, right column) with proper follow-up.\n\nIf O takes 2 instead, then:\n- Top row: 0-1-2 (X-O-O) \u2014 not useful.\n- Right column: 2-5-8.\n- Diagonal 2-4-6.\n\nStill strong.\n\nBut with X at 0, if O takes 6, then diagonal 6-4-2 opens and left column (0-3-6) has X and O \u2014 less clean.\n\nBest balance: **8** gives O space to expand without direct conflict, controls three lines, and disrupts X\u2019s symmetry.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: The center (4) and opposite corner (8) establish maximum influence. O controls the most critical lines: vertical (3-4-5), horizontal (1-4-7), diagonal (0-4-8 blocked), and gains bottom row and right column from 8.\n\nThis move denies X any quick development and gives O initiative.\n\n**All Experts Now Converging: 8 is best move.**\n\n[All Experts Agree]  \nThe optimal move is [8].\n\n[4] \u2192 [0] \u2192 [8] is classic opening.\n\nFinal decision:  \n[8]",

However, O doesn't gain an immediate threat.\n\nBut more importantly, O wants to build toward **own** threats.\n\nBetter: if O takes **2** or **6**, and later secures another corner, can create two-in-a-row with open third.\n\nLet\u2019s reevaluate:\n\nIf O takes **2 (top-right)**:  \n- Then O controls top row (X-O-O) \u2014 not a threat, but future.  \n- O also controls right column (2-5-8) \u2014 open.  \n- And diagonal 2-4-6 \u2014 possible.\n\nSimilarly, if O takes **6 (bottom-left)**:  \n- Left column (0-3-6) \u2014 X and O, but 3 open.  \n- Bottom row (6-7-8) \u2014 open.  \n- Diagonal 6-4-2 \u2014 possible.\n\nBut here's the key: **corner 8 (bottom-right)** is best because:\n- It\u2019s opposite to X\u2019s 0, denying the full diagonal.\n- It gives O strong presence in bottom row and right column.\n- It avoids crowding with X at top-left.\n\nBut wait \u2014 in standard optimal play, after:\n- O1: center (4)\n- X1: corner (0)\nThen **O2 should take the opposite corner (8)** to maximize control and reduce X's counterplay.\n\nYes \u2014 this is well-established in Tic Tac Toe theory.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: By taking 8, O blocks the 0-4-8 diagonal from ever being used by X and secures a strong corner. This prevents future X fork attempts that rely on symmetry.\n\nNo other move defends against X\u2019s potential as solidly.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: From corner 8 and center 4, O can aim to complete:\n- Diagonal 2-4-6? No \u2014 8 is not on that.\n- Right column: 2-5-8 \u2014 yes.\n- Bottom row: 6-7-8 \u2014 yes.\nSo O can threaten two different lines (bottom row, right column) with proper follow-up.\n\nIf O takes 2 instead, then:\n- Top row: 0-1-2 (X-O-O) \u2014 not useful.\n- Right column: 2-5-8.\n- Diagonal 2-4-6.\n\nStill strong.\n\nBut with X at 0, if O takes 6, then diagonal 6-4-2 opens and left column (0-3-6) has X and O \u2014 less clean.\n\nBest balance: **8** gives O space to expand without direct conflict, controls three lines, and disrupts X\u2019s symmetry.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: The center (4) and opposite corner (8) establish maximum influence. O controls the most critical lines: vertical (3-4-5), horizontal (1-4-7), diagonal (0-4-8 blocked), and gains bottom row and right column from 8.\n\nThis move denies X any quick development and gives O initiative.\n\n**All Experts Now Converging: 8 is best move.**\n\n[All Experts Agree]  \nThe optimal move is [8].\n\n[4] \u2192 [0] \u2192 [8] is classic opening.\n\nFinal decision:  \n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'",

Current counts:  \n- Corner 0 already held by X. The edge 1 and diagonal 2 positions need evaluation. Early build-up plan: after 0 (corner), taking the opposite corner 7 (bottom-center or top-middle?) Wait \u2014 actually, the pattern that threatens forks fastest for X is \u201ccorner\u2013center\u2013symmetric corner\u201d, but we missed center. After 0 and 4 (taken by O), the next best corner-oriented fork is corner 2 or 6 pairing with 0.  \nHowever, to craft a quick fork here: X needs a cell that simultaneously opens TWO three-in-a-row threats. Scan the lines for placements that give two unblocked twos. Target: corner 2 gives the diagonal 0-4-2 (0 is X, 4 is O) \u2192 safe but doesn\u2019t threaten double. Instead, **corner 6** yields (0-3-6) and (6-7-8) is a row \u2014 not immediate. Essentially, against 0-4-8 opening by O, the only realistic X strategy is to aim to **pair 0 and 6 on a diagonal** and **0 and 2 horizontally** \u2014 yet the key insight is that **edge placement in cells 1, 3, 5, 7 CANNOT make a fork next move**, but CORNER placement CAN prepare diagonal plays. Thus focus on corner 2 or 6.\n\n[Expert 3 \u2013 Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate symmetry and parity. With O sitting at 4+8 (center and one corner), X\u2019s minimal-loss move is to claim another corner to restore balance and threaten future. Among the corners left: 2 (top-right) and 6 (bottom-left). Either captures three lines and resists O center corner edge blitz. Momentum slightly favors 2 \u2014 it neutralizes top-right anchor and sits away from the already claimed 8, giving room for stable fight later.\n\n[Expert 1 \u2013 Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: The stronger defensive guarantee is to reserve corner 6, because it reduces O\u2019s lower-row control (6-7-8 currently has 8=O, 6 and 7 open). By planting X at 6, we force O to fight on that row with only later reinforcements.\n\n[Expert 2 \u2013 Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Exactly; placing X at corner 6 yields:  \n- immediate weak diagonal 0-4-6 (0=X,4=O,6=X) \u2014 not a threat  \n- but places pressure on bottom row 6-7-8, now forcing O to defend instead of press, and also threatens the column 6-3-0, building fork potential in future rows. Confirmed advantage.\n\n[Expert 3 \u2013 Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Once 6 is taken, the board gains mirror symmetry that stymies O fork chances without handing initiative.\n\n[All Experts Agree]  \nThe optimal move is [6].",

Aim to maximize future lines (rows, columns, diagonals) that could lead to three in a row.  \nCenter (4) is the most powerful square \u2014 it participates in four possible winning lines (middle row, middle column, both diagonals). Strong candidate.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control and long-term positioning. The center (4) offers maximum influence over the game, followed by corners (0, 2, 6, 8), then edges (1, 3, 5, 7).  \nTaking the center first provides best control and flexibility.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Since the board is empty, the only \"threat\" is potential future dominance by X. If X takes center later, it becomes harder to block. Therefore, securing key positions early is defensive.  \nThus, playing in center (4) also serves as preventive defense.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Playing in center (4) maximizes future forks (situations where two winning possibilities arise simultaneously). From center, O can build toward corners and edges efficiently.  \nNo other square offers as many fast win paths.

Corners (0,2,6,8) offer participation in three lines; edges offer two.  \nSide as X, want to create forks; best path is taking a corner opposite the center to open diagonal play. Candidates: 0, 2, 6, 8.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: With center occupied by O, next critical squares are corners, giving three attacking lines. Edge squares (1,3,5,7) yield only two.  \nAmong corners, since board is symmetric right now, any corner gives equal positional benefit.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Intend to prevent any potential fork by O. O already has center; if X plays edge, O can mirror into corners and create threats. Corners (0,2,6,8) give X balanced defense without allowing O quick skewer threats.  \nAmong corners, 0,2,6,8 equivalent for defense.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: To prepare multiple winning paths, choose a corner. Each corner ties into two diagonals, plus a row & column. A corner plus center diagonal line later could create forks. Any of 0,2,6,8 work equally well for building offensive pressure.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Any corner claim secures symmetric strain-counterplay.

X has only one mark at 0. Check if X has two in a row \u2014 no. But note: X occupies corner 0, O occupies center 4. If X gets 8 (opposite corner), it creates a diagonal threat (0-4-8). Must block that possibility if needed later.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Evaluate current opportunities for O to build winning lines. O has center (4). Best chance is to take a corner \u2014 corners give three possible win paths from center. Ideal move: take a corner that pairs with center for diagonal or row/column. Candidate corners: 2 (top-right), 6 (bottom-left), 8 (bottom-right). Avoid 0 \u2014 already taken.\n\nBut note: if O takes 8, and X took 0, then diagonal 0-4-8 is blocked, but O gains strong presence. Also, taking 2 or 6 opens potential forks.\n\nBut which corner best enables fork potential? Consider that O in 8 and later 2 creates top row threat and right column threat \u2014 could lead to double threat.\n\nWait \u2014 better idea: if O takes a corner *adjacent* to X\u2019s corner, not opposite, it avoids symmetry and may open earlier win. But actual strongest path is to take a corner that allows two potential lines to develop.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: After X takes corner 0, O should aim for another corner to maximize influence. Center + corner gives O control of one diagonal and parts of row/column. Remaining corners: 2, 6, 8. Each is strong. However, taking **8 (opposite corner)** is strategically strongest \u2014 it denies X the diagonal (0-4-8), asserts counter-control, and maintains initiative. This is a classic book move: when opponent takes a corner, responding with opposite corner after controlling center is ideal.\n\nMoreover, occupying 8 gives O:  \n- Diagonal: 2-4-6 (no, wait \u2014 8 connects 0-4-8 diagonal? No \u2014 O is at 4 and 8, so 0-4-8 is O-O-X, which is good \u2014 blocks X from completing it)  \nWait: 0 is X, 4 is O, 8 is candidate. If O takes 8, then diagonal 0-4-8 becomes X-O-O \u2014 not a win for O, but prevents X from ever winning that diagonal. However, O doesn't gain an immediate threat.\n\nBut more importantly, O wants to build toward **own** threats.\n\nBetter: if O takes **2** or **6**, and later secures another corner, can create two-in-a-row with open third.\n\nLet\u2019s reevaluate:\n\nIf O takes **2 (top-right)**:  \n- Then O controls top row (X-O-O) \u2014 not a threat, but future.  \n- O also controls right column (2-5-8) \u2014 open.  \n- And diagonal 2-4-6 \u2014 possible.\n\nSimilarly, if O takes **6 (bottom-left)**:  \n- Left column (0-3-6) \u2014 X and O, but 3 open.  \n- Bottom row (6-7-8) \u2014 open.  \n- Diagonal 6-4-2 \u2014 possible.\n\nBut here's the key: **corner 8 (bottom-right)** is best because:\n- It\u2019s opposite to X\u2019s 0, denying the full diagonal.\n- It gives O strong presence in bottom row and right column.\n- It avoids crowding with X at top-left.\n\nBut wait \u2014 in standard optimal play, after:\n- O1: center (4)\n- X1: corner (0)\nThen **O2 should take the opposite corner (8)** to maximize control and reduce X's counterplay.\n\nYes \u2014 this is well-established in Tic Tac Toe theory.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: By taking 8, O blocks the 0-4-8 diagonal from ever being used by X and secures a strong corner.

Best chance is to take a corner \u2014 corners give three possible win paths from center. Ideal move: take a corner that pairs with center for diagonal or row/column. Candidate corners: 2 (top-right), 6 (bottom-left), 8 (bottom-right). Avoid 0 \u2014 already taken.\n\nBut note: if O takes 8, and X took 0, then diagonal 0-4-8 is blocked, but O gains strong presence. Also, taking 2 or 6 opens potential forks.\n\nBut which corner best enables fork potential? Consider that O in 8 and later 2 creates top row threat and right column threat \u2014 could lead to double threat.\n\nWait \u2014 better idea: if O takes a corner *adjacent* to X\u2019s corner, not opposite, it avoids symmetry and may open earlier win. But actual strongest path is to take a corner that allows two potential lines to develop.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: After X takes corner 0, O should aim for another corner to maximize influence. Center + corner gives O control of one diagonal and parts of row/column. Remaining corners: 2, 6, 8. Each is strong. However, taking **8 (opposite corner)** is strategically strongest \u2014 it denies X the diagonal (0-4-8), asserts counter-control, and maintains initiative. This is a classic book move: when opponent takes a corner, responding with opposite corner after controlling center is ideal.\n\nMoreover, occupying 8 gives O:  \n- Diagonal: 2-4-6 (no, wait \u2014 8 connects 0-4-8 diagonal? No \u2014 O is at 4 and 8, so 0-4-8 is O-O-X, which is good \u2014 blocks X from completing it)  \nWait: 0 is X, 4 is O, 8 is candidate. If O takes 8, then diagonal 0-4-8 becomes X-O-O \u2014 not a win for O, but prevents X from ever winning that diagonal. However, O doesn't gain an immediate threat.\n\nBut more importantly, O wants to build toward **own** threats.\n\nBetter: if O takes **2** or **6**, and later secures another corner, can create two-in-a-row with open third.\n\nLet\u2019s reevaluate:\n\nIf O takes **2 (top-right)**:  \n- Then O controls top row (X-O-O) \u2014 not a threat, but future.  \n- O also controls right column (2-5-8) \u2014 open.  \n- And diagonal 2-4-6 \u2014 possible.\n\nSimilarly, if O takes **6 (bottom-left)**:  \n- Left column (0-3-6) \u2014 X and O, but 3 open.  \n- Bottom row (6-7-8) \u2014 open.  \n- Diagonal 6-4-2 \u2014 possible.\n\nBut here's the key: **corner 8 (bottom-right)** is best because:\n- It\u2019s opposite to X\u2019s 0, denying the full diagonal.\n- It gives O strong presence in bottom row and right column.\n- It avoids crowding with X at top-left.\n\nBut wait \u2014 in standard optimal play, after:\n- O1: center (4)\n- X1: corner (0)\nThen **O2 should take the opposite corner (8)** to maximize control and reduce X's counterplay.\n\nYes \u2014 this is well-established in Tic Tac Toe theory.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: By taking 8, O blocks the 0-4-8 diagonal from ever being used by X and secures a strong corner. This prevents future X fork attempts that rely on symmetry.\n\nNo other move defends against X\u2019s potential as solidly.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: From corner 8 and center 4, O can aim to complete:\n- Diagonal 2-4-6? No \u2014 8 is not on that.\n- Right column: 2-5-8 \u2014 yes.\n- Bottom row: 6-7-8 \u2014 yes.\nSo O can threaten two different lines (bottom row, right column) with proper follow-up.\n\nIf O takes 2 instead, then:\n- Top row: 0-1-2 (X-O-O) \u2014 not useful.\n- Right column: 2-5-8.\n- Diagonal 2-4-6.\n\nStill strong.\n\nBut with X at 0, if O takes 6, then diagonal 6-4-2 opens and left column (0-3-6) has X and O \u2014 less clean.\n\nBest balance: **8** gives O space to expand without direct conflict, controls three lines, and disrupts X\u2019s symmetry.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: The center (4) and opposite corner (8) establish maximum influence. O controls the most critical lines: vertical (3-4-5), horizontal (1-4-7), diagonal (0-4-8 blocked), and gains bottom row and right column from 8.\n\nThis move denies X any quick development and gives O initiative.\n\n**All Experts Now Converging: 8 is best move.**\n\n[All Experts Agree]  \nThe optimal move is [8].\n\n[4] \u2192 [0] \u2192 [8] is classic opening.\n\nFinal decision:  \n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] \n\n[Expert 1 \u2013 Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Scan every row, column, and diagonal for immediate threats from O.  \n- Row 2 (6-7-8): 8 is O, 6 and 7 empty \u2192 one O, not a threat yet.  \n- Column 2 (2-5-8): 8 is O, 2 and 5 empty \u2192 one O.  \n- Diagonals: 0-4-8 has 0 = X, 4 = O, 8 = O \u2192 X-O-O, safe for now. No two-in-a-row for O need blocking on next move.\n\n[Expert 2 \u2013 Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for first possible forks for X (two different lines that could each become XXX with one more X). Current counts:  \n- Corner 0 already held by X. The edge 1 and diagonal 2 positions need evaluation. Early build-up plan: after 0 (corner), taking the opposite corner 7 (bottom-center or top-middle?) Wait \u2014 actually, the pattern that threatens forks fastest for X is \u201ccorner\u2013center\u2013symmetric corner\u201d, but we missed center. After 0 and 4 (taken by O), the next best corner-oriented fork is corner 2 or 6 pairing with 0.  \nHowever, to craft a quick fork here: X needs a cell that simultaneously opens TWO three-in-a-row threats. Scan the lines for placements that give two unblocked twos. Target: corner 2 gives the diagonal 0-4-2 (0 is X, 4 is O) \u2192 safe but doesn\u2019t threaten double. Instead, **corner 6** yields (0-3-6) and (6-7-8) is a row \u2014 not immediate. Essentially, against 0-4-8 opening by O, the only realistic X strategy is to aim to **pair 0 and 6 on a diagonal** and **0 and 2 horizontally** \u2014 yet the key insight is that **edge placement in cells 1, 3, 5, 7 CANNOT make a fork next move**, but CORNER placement CAN prepare diagonal plays. Thus focus on corner 2 or 6.\n\n[Expert 3 \u2013 Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate symmetry and parity. With O sitting at 4+8 (center and one corner), X\u2019s minimal-loss move is to claim another corner to restore balance and threaten future. Among the corners left: 2 (top-right) and 6 (bottom-left). Either captures three lines and resists O center corner edge blitz. Momentum slightly favors 2 \u2014 it neutralizes top-right anchor and sits away from the already claimed 8, giving room for stable fight later.\n\n[Expert 1 \u2013 Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: The stronger defensive guarantee is to reserve corner 6, because it reduces O\u2019s lower-row control (6-7-8 currently has 8=O, 6 and 7 open). By planting X at 6, we force O to fight on that row with only later reinforcements.\n\n[Expert 2 \u2013 Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Exactly; placing X at corner 6 yields:  \n- immediate weak diagonal 0-4-6 (0=X,4=O,6=X) \u2014 not a threat  \n- but places pressure on bottom row 6-7-8, now forcing O to defend instead of press, and also threatens the column 6-3-0, building fork potential in future rows. Confirmed advantage.\n\n[Expert 3 \u2013 Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Once 6 is taken, the board gains mirror symmetry that stymies O fork chances without handing initiative.\n\n[All Experts Agree]  \nThe optimal move is [6].\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[5]', '[7]'",

Check if X has two in a row that could lead to a win on their next move.  \nCurrent board is empty, so no immediate threats. Proceed to assess potential future threats.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for moves that create the most immediate winning opportunities for O. Aim to maximize future lines (rows, columns, diagonals) that could lead to three in a row.  \nCenter (4) is the most powerful square \u2014 it participates in four possible winning lines (middle row, middle column, both diagonals). Strong candidate.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control and long-term positioning. The center (4) offers maximum influence over the game, followed by corners (0, 2, 6, 8), then edges (1, 3, 5, 7).  \nTaking the center first provides best control and flexibility.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Since the board is empty, the only \"threat\" is potential future dominance by X. If X takes center later, it becomes harder to block. Therefore, securing key positions early is defensive.  \nThus, playing in center (4) also serves as preventive defense.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Playing in center (4) maximizes future forks (situations where two winning possibilities arise simultaneously). From center, O can build toward corners and edges efficiently.  \nNo other square offers as many fast win paths. Confirmed: 4 is optimal.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: With no prior moves, first move should claim highest-value square.

No, board only shows one O (4). No immediate blocking needed.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for two X\u2019s anywhere. None so far. Evaluate highest-value remaining positions. Corners (0,2,6,8) offer participation in three lines; edges offer two.  \nSide as X, want to create forks; best path is taking a corner opposite the center to open diagonal play. Candidates: 0, 2, 6, 8.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: With center occupied by O, next critical squares are corners, giving three attacking lines. Edge squares (1,3,5,7) yield only two.  \nAmong corners, since board is symmetric right now, any corner gives equal positional benefit.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Intend to prevent any potential fork by O. O already has center; if X plays edge, O can mirror into corners and create threats. Corners (0,2,6,8) give X balanced defense without allowing O quick skewer threats.  \nAmong corners, 0,2,6,8 equivalent for defense.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: To prepare multiple winning paths, choose a corner. Each corner ties into two diagonals, plus a row & column. A corner plus center diagonal line later could create forks. Any of 0,2,6,8 work equally well for building offensive pressure.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Any corner claim secures symmetric strain-counterplay.

X has only one mark at 0. Check if X has two in a row \u2014 no. But note: X occupies corner 0, O occupies center 4. If X gets 8 (opposite corner), it creates a diagonal threat (0-4-8). Must block that possibility if needed later.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Evaluate current opportunities for O to build winning lines. O has center (4). Best chance is to take a corner \u2014 corners give three possible win paths from center. Ideal move: take a corner that pairs with center for diagonal or row/column. Candidate corners: 2 (top-right), 6 (bottom-left), 8 (bottom-right). Avoid 0 \u2014 already taken.\n\nBut note: if O takes 8, and X took 0, then diagonal 0-4-8 is blocked, but O gains strong presence. Also, taking 2 or 6 opens potential forks.\n\nBut which corner best enables fork potential? Consider that O in 8 and later 2 creates top row threat and right column threat \u2014 could lead to double threat.\n\nWait \u2014 better idea: if O takes a corner *adjacent* to X\u2019s corner, not opposite, it avoids symmetry and may open earlier win. But actual strongest path is to take a corner that allows two potential lines to develop.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: After X takes corner 0, O should aim for another corner to maximize influence. Center + corner gives O control of one diagonal and parts of row/column. Remaining corners: 2, 6, 8. Each is strong. However, taking **8 (opposite corner)** is strategically strongest \u2014 it denies X the diagonal (0-4-8), asserts counter-control, and maintains initiative. This is a classic book move: when opponent takes a corner, responding with opposite corner after controlling center is ideal.\n\nMoreover, occupying 8 gives O:  \n- Diagonal: 2-4-6 (no, wait \u2014 8 connects 0-4-8 diagonal? No \u2014 O is at 4 and 8, so 0-4-8 is O-O-X, which is good \u2014 blocks X from completing it)  \nWait: 0 is X, 4 is O, 8 is candidate. If O takes 8, then diagonal 0-4-8 becomes X-O-O \u2014 not a win for O, but prevents X from ever winning that diagonal. However, O doesn't gain an immediate threat.\n\nBut more importantly, O wants to build toward **own** threats.\n\nBetter: if O takes **2** or **6**, and later secures another corner, can create two-in-a-row with open third.\n\nLet\u2019s reevaluate:\n\nIf O takes **2 (top-right)**:  \n- Then O controls top row (X-O-O) \u2014 not a threat, but future.  \n- O also controls right column (2-5-8) \u2014 open.  \n- And diagonal 2-4-6 \u2014 possible.\n\nSimilarly, if O takes **6 (bottom-left)**:  \n- Left column (0-3-6) \u2014 X and O, but 3 open.  \n- Bottom row (6-7-8) \u2014 open.  \n- Diagonal 6-4-2 \u2014 possible.\n\nBut here's the key: **corner 8 (bottom-right)** is best because:\n- It\u2019s opposite to X\u2019s 0, denying the full diagonal.\n- It gives O strong presence in bottom row and right column.\n- It avoids crowding with X at top-left.\n\nBut wait \u2014 in standard optimal play, after:\n- O1: center (4)\n- X1: corner (0)\nThen **O2 should take the opposite corner (8)** to maximize control and reduce X's counterplay.\n\nYes \u2014 this is well-established in Tic Tac Toe theory.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: By taking 8, O blocks the 0-4-8 diagonal from ever being used by X and secures a strong corner. This prevents future X fork attempts that rely on symmetry.\n\nNo other move defends against X\u2019s potential as solidly.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: From corner 8 and center 4, O can aim to complete:\n- Diagonal 2-4-6? No \u2014 8 is not on that.\n- Right column: 2-5-8 \u2014 yes.\n- Bottom row: 6-7-8 \u2014 yes.\nSo O can threaten two different lines (bottom row, right column) with proper follow-up.\n\nIf O takes 2 instead, then:\n- Top row: 0-1-2 (X-O-O) \u2014 not useful.\n- Right column: 2-5-8.\n- Diagonal 2-4-6.\n\nStill strong.\n\nBut with X at 0, if O takes 6, then diagonal 6-4-2 opens and left column (0-3-6) has X and O \u2014 less clean.\n\nBest balance: **8** gives O space to expand without direct conflict, controls three lines, and disrupts X\u2019s symmetry.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: The center (4) and opposite corner (8) establish maximum influence. O controls the most critical lines: vertical (3-4-5), horizontal (1-4-7), diagonal (0-4-8 blocked), and gains bottom row and right column from 8.\n\nThis move denies X any quick development and gives O initiative.\n\n**All Experts Now Converging: 8 is best move.**\n\n[All Experts Agree]  \nThe optimal move is [8].\n\n[4] \u2192 [0] \u2192 [8] is classic opening.\n\nFinal decision:  \n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] \n\n[Expert 1 \u2013 Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Scan every row, column, and diagonal for immediate threats from O.  \n- Row 2 (6-7-8): 8 is O, 6 and 7 empty \u2192 one O, not a threat yet.  \n- Column 2 (2-5-8): 8 is O, 2 and 5 empty \u2192 one O.  \n- Diagonals: 0-4-8 has 0 = X, 4 = O, 8 = O \u2192 X-O-O, safe for now.

So row 2 cannot be a win for O.\n\n**Therefore, 7 is on a dead row** \u2014 no winning possibility along row 2 for O (6=X, 7=?, 8=O \u2192 even if O plays 7, it's X-O-O \u2192 not three O\u2019s).  \nSo playing 7 gives only **column 1** as a future line.\n\nBut playing 1:\n- Column 1: O-O at 1 and 4 \u2192 threat on 7\n- Row 0: X-O-? \u2192 if 2 is available, can become X-O-O \u2014 again, not a win for O.\n\nSo both are equal?

Needs 1 and 7.\n\nO can get one now, and hopes to get the last one later.\n\nBut currently:\n- Column 1: 1 and 7 are free\n- O to move\n\nSo O must play **one of 1 or 7** to threaten to complete the column.\n\nEither move creates a two-in-a-row on column 1: O-O-? or ?-O-O\n\nBut which is better?\n\nThey are symmetric. Since the board has no other imbalance, **either 1 or 7 is equivalent**.\n\nBut \u2014 **X will block the threat on the next move** if it's not winning.\n\nSo after O plays, say, 1 \u2192 threat at 7 \u2192 X plays 7 \u2192 then O plays 2 \u2192 game draws.\n\nSame if O plays 7 \u2192 X plays 1 \u2192 O plays 2 \u2192 draw.\n\nSo **no winning possibility exists for O** \u2014 only forced draw.\n\nTherefore, **any move that maintains the draw is acceptable**.\n\nBut since 1 and 7 are equal, and 2 is a dead end (no winning line), the expert group recommends playing **1 or 7**, doesn't matter.\n\nBut must pick one.\n\n[All Experts Converge]  \nSince the only meaningful line is column 1, and O must claim one edge of it, and no preference exists between 1 and 7, **choose 1 for symmetry** (top side, like other early moves).\n\nHowever \u2014 wait: after O takes 1, then the board is:\n- Row 0: X-O-2\n- Column 1: O-O-7 open \u2192 threat at 7\n\nBut if next move X blocks at 7, done.\n\nBut what if O plays **2** instead?\n\nThen no threat \u2192 X can take 1 or 7 at leisure \u2192 then blocks column 1 \u2192 O cannot win.\n\nWorse \u2014 if O plays 2, **no threat created**, X can respond anywhere.\n\nSo playing 2 is **passive** \u2014 lets X choose how to block.\n\nBut if O plays 1 or 7, **creates immediate win threat**, forcing X to use their move to block.\n\nThus, O **must** play in column 1 \u2014 either 1 or 7.\n\nChoose **1**.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[1]",

Check if X has two in a row that could lead to a win on their next move.  \nCurrent board is empty, so no immediate threats. Proceed to assess potential future threats.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for moves that create the most immediate winning opportunities for O. Aim to maximize future lines (rows, columns, diagonals) that could lead to three in a row.  \nCenter (4) is the most powerful square \u2014 it participates in four possible winning lines (middle row, middle column, both diagonals). Strong candidate.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control and long-term positioning. The center (4) offers maximum influence over the game, followed by corners (0, 2, 6, 8), then edges (1, 3, 5, 7).  \nTaking the center first provides best control and flexibility.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Since the board is empty, the only \"threat\" is potential future dominance by X. If X takes center later, it becomes harder to block. Therefore, securing key positions early is defensive.  \nThus, playing in center (4) also serves as preventive defense.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Playing in center (4) maximizes future forks (situations where two winning possibilities arise simultaneously). From center, O can build toward corners and edges efficiently.  \nNo other square offers as many fast win paths. Confirmed: 4 is optimal.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: With no prior moves, first move should claim highest-value square.

No, board only shows one O (4). No immediate blocking needed.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for two X\u2019s anywhere. None so far. Evaluate highest-value remaining positions. Corners (0,2,6,8) offer participation in three lines; edges offer two.  \nSide as X, want to create forks; best path is taking a corner opposite the center to open diagonal play. Candidates: 0, 2, 6, 8.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: With center occupied by O, next critical squares are corners, giving three attacking lines. Edge squares (1,3,5,7) yield only two.  \nAmong corners, since board is symmetric right now, any corner gives equal positional benefit.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Intend to prevent any potential fork by O. O already has center; if X plays edge, O can mirror into corners and create threats. Corners (0,2,6,8) give X balanced defense without allowing O quick skewer threats.  \nAmong corners, 0,2,6,8 equivalent for defense.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: To prepare multiple winning paths, choose a corner. Each corner ties into two diagonals, plus a row & column. A corner plus center diagonal line later could create forks. Any of 0,2,6,8 work equally well for building offensive pressure.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Any corner claim secures symmetric strain-counterplay. Corner (0) is as good as corner (8) and others. Minor tiebreaker\u2014upper-left corner (0) keeps traditional.\n\n[All Experts Agree]  \nThe optimal move is [0].\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Identify any immediate threats from Player X. X has only one mark at 0. Check if X has two in a row \u2014 no. But note: X occupies corner 0, O occupies center 4. If X gets 8 (opposite corner), it creates a diagonal threat (0-4-8). Must block that possibility if needed later.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Evaluate current opportunities for O to build winning lines. O has center (4). Best chance is to take a corner \u2014 corners give three possible win paths from center. Ideal move: take a corner that pairs with center for diagonal or row/column. Candidate corners: 2 (top-right), 6 (bottom-left), 8 (bottom-right). Avoid 0 \u2014 already taken.\n\nBut note: if O takes 8, and X took 0, then diagonal 0-4-8 is blocked, but O gains strong presence. Also, taking 2 or 6 opens potential forks.\n\nBut which corner best enables fork potential? Consider that O in 8 and later 2 creates top row threat and right column threat \u2014 could lead to double threat.\n\nWait \u2014 better idea: if O takes a corner *adjacent* to X\u2019s corner, not opposite, it avoids symmetry and may open earlier win. But actual strongest path is to take a corner that allows two potential lines to develop.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: After X takes corner 0, O should aim for another corner to maximize influence. Center + corner gives O control of one diagonal and parts of row/column. Remaining corners: 2, 6, 8. Each is strong. However, taking **8 (opposite corner)** is strategically strongest \u2014 it denies X the diagonal (0-4-8), asserts counter-control, and maintains initiative. This is a classic book move: when opponent takes a corner, responding with opposite corner after controlling center is ideal.\n\nMoreover, occupying 8 gives O:  \n- Diagonal: 2-4-6 (no, wait \u2014 8 connects 0-4-8 diagonal? No \u2014 O is at 4 and 8, so 0-4-8 is O-O-X, which is good \u2014 blocks X from completing it)  \nWait: 0 is X, 4 is O, 8 is candidate. If O takes 8, then diagonal 0-4-8 becomes X-O-O \u2014 not a win for O, but prevents X from ever winning that diagonal. However, O doesn't gain an immediate threat.\n\nBut more importantly, O wants to build toward **own** threats.\n\nBetter: if O takes **2** or **6**, and later secures another corner, can create two-in-a-row with open third.\n\nLet\u2019s reevaluate:\n\nIf O takes **2 (top-right)**:  \n- Then O controls top row (X-O-O) \u2014 not a threat, but future.  \n- O also controls right column (2-5-8) \u2014 open.  \n- And diagonal 2-4-6 \u2014 possible.\n\nSimilarly, if O takes **6 (bottom-left)**:  \n- Left column (0-3-6) \u2014 X and O, but 3 open.  \n- Bottom row (6-7-8) \u2014 open.  \n- Diagonal 6-4-2 \u2014 possible.\n\nBut here's the key: **corner 8 (bottom-right)** is best because:\n- It\u2019s opposite to X\u2019s 0, denying the full diagonal.\n- It gives O strong presence in bottom row and right column.\n- It avoids crowding with X at top-left.\n\nBut wait \u2014 in standard optimal play, after:\n- O1: center (4)\n- X1: corner (0)\nThen **O2 should take the opposite corner (8)** to maximize control and reduce X's counterplay.\n\nYes \u2014 this is well-established in Tic Tac Toe theory.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: By taking 8, O blocks the 0-4-8 diagonal from ever being used by X and secures a strong corner. This prevents future X fork attempts that rely on symmetry.\n\nNo other move defends against X\u2019s potential as solidly.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: From corner 8 and center 4, O can aim to complete:\n- Diagonal 2-4-6? No \u2014 8 is not on that.\n- Right column: 2-5-8 \u2014 yes.\n- Bottom row: 6-7-8 \u2014 yes.\nSo O can threaten two different lines (bottom row, right column) with proper follow-up.\n\nIf O takes 2 instead, then:\n- Top row: 0-1-2 (X-O-O) \u2014 not useful.\n- Right column: 2-5-8.\n- Diagonal 2-4-6.\n\nStill strong.\n\nBut with X at 0, if O takes 6, then diagonal 6-4-2 opens and left column (0-3-6) has X and O \u2014 less clean.\n\nBest balance: **8** gives O space to expand without direct conflict, controls three lines, and disrupts X\u2019s symmetry.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: The center (4) and opposite corner (8) establish maximum influence. O controls the most critical lines: vertical (3-4-5), horizontal (1-4-7), diagonal (0-4-8 blocked), and gains bottom row and right column from 8.\n\nThis move denies X any quick development and gives O initiative.\n\n**All Experts Now Converging: 8 is best move.**\n\n[All Experts Agree]  \nThe optimal move is [8].\n\n[4] \u2192 [0] \u2192 [8] is classic opening.\n\nFinal decision:  \n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] \n\n[Expert 1 \u2013 Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Scan every row, column, and diagonal for immediate threats from O.  \n- Row 2 (6-7-8): 8 is O, 6 and 7 empty \u2192 one O, not a threat yet.  \n- Column 2 (2-5-8): 8 is O, 2 and 5 empty \u2192 one O.  \n- Diagonals: 0-4-8 has 0 = X, 4 = O, 8 = O \u2192 X-O-O, safe for now. No two-in-a-row for O need blocking on next move.\n\n[Expert 2 \u2013 Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for first possible forks for X (two different lines that could each become XXX with one more X). Current counts:  \n- Corner 0 already held by X. The edge 1 and diagonal 2 positions need evaluation. Early build-up plan: after 0 (corner), taking the opposite corner 7 (bottom-center or top-middle?) Wait \u2014 actually, the pattern that threatens forks fastest for X is \u201ccorner\u2013center\u2013symmetric corner\u201d, but we missed center. After 0 and 4 (taken by O), the next best corner-oriented fork is corner 2 or 6 pairing with 0.  \nHowever, to craft a quick fork here: X needs a cell that simultaneously opens TWO three-in-a-row threats. Scan the lines for placements that give two unblocked twos. Target: corner 2 gives the diagonal 0-4-2 (0 is X, 4 is O) \u2192 safe but doesn\u2019t threaten double. Instead, **corner 6** yields (0-3-6) and (6-7-8) is a row \u2014 not immediate. Essentially, against 0-4-8 opening by O, the only realistic X strategy is to aim to **pair 0 and 6 on a diagonal** and **0 and 2 horizontally** \u2014 yet the key insight is that **edge placement in cells 1, 3, 5, 7 CANNOT make a fork next move**, but CORNER placement CAN prepare diagonal plays. Thus focus on corner 2 or 6.\n\n[Expert 3 \u2013 Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate symmetry and parity. With O sitting at 4+8 (center and one corner), X\u2019s minimal-loss move is to claim another corner to restore balance and threaten future. Among the corners left: 2 (top-right) and 6 (bottom-left). Either captures three lines and resists O center corner edge blitz. Momentum slightly favors 2 \u2014 it neutralizes top-right anchor and sits away from the already claimed 8, giving room for stable fight later.\n\n[Expert 1 \u2013 Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: The stronger defensive guarantee is to reserve corner 6, because it reduces O\u2019s lower-row control (6-7-8 currently has 8=O, 6 and 7 open). By planting X at 6, we force O to fight on that row with only later reinforcements.\n\n[Expert 2 \u2013 Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Exactly; placing X at corner 6 yields:  \n- immediate weak diagonal 0-4-6 (0=X,4=O,6=X) \u2014 not a threat  \n- but places pressure on bottom row 6-7-8, now forcing O to defend instead of press, and also threatens the column 6-3-0, building fork potential in future rows. Confirmed advantage.\n\n[Expert 3 \u2013 Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Once 6 is taken, the board gains mirror symmetry that stymies O fork chances without handing initiative.\n\n[All Experts Agree]  \nThe optimal move is [6].\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] [Expert 1 \u2013 Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Inspect each line for any **immediate two-in-a-row by O** that needs an instant block.  \n- Row 1 (3-4-5): 3=O, 4=O \u2192 O-O-empty. **Threat detected!** If 5 is left open, O will win next move with 3-4-5.  \n- All other rows/columns/diagonals have at most one O, so no other threats.\n\n[Expert 2 \u2013 Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Search for a **fork opportunity for X**\u2014a single move that would simultaneously create two separate three-in-a-row threats.  \n- Cell 2: would create top row (0-1-2) and diagonal (2-4-6). However, 4 is O, so 2-4-6 would be 2-X-O and cannot become a threat.  \n- Cell 1: would create top row (0-1-2) and middle column (1-4-7).

So row 2 cannot be a win for O.\n\n**Therefore, 7 is on a dead row** \u2014 no winning possibility along row 2 for O (6=X, 7=?, 8=O \u2192 even if O plays 7, it's X-O-O \u2192 not three O\u2019s).  \nSo playing 7 gives only **column 1** as a future line.\n\nBut playing 1:\n- Column 1: O-O at 1 and 4 \u2192 threat on 7\n- Row 0: X-O-? \u2192 if 2 is available, can become X-O-O \u2014 again, not a win for O.\n\nSo both are equal? But wait \u2014 **only one move creates a threat that isn't already blocked**.\n\nActually \u2014 **column 1 is the only viable winning line left for O**:\n- Needs two of 1, 4, 7\n- 4 is O\n- So must take both 1 and 7 to complete column 1\n\nThus, O must play **one of 1 or 7 now**, creating a two-in-a-row threat.\n\nBut if O plays 7, then row 2 is full (6=X, 7=O, 8=O) \u2192 harmless\nAnd column 1 is O at 4 and 7 \u2192 threatens 1\n\nIf O plays 1, then column 1 is O at 1 and 4 \u2192 threatens 7\n\nSame threat.\n\nBut \u2014 **which cell allows a fork if X fails to block**?\n\nNo fork \u2014 either way, X will block the single threat.\n\nBut \u2014 is there any **difference in control**?\n\nWait \u2014 **no other winning line possible for O**:\n- Row 0: 0=X \u2192 if O takes 1 and 2, it's X-O-O \u2192 not a win\n- Row 1: full\n- Row 2: 6=X, 8=O \u2192 even with 7, not three O\u2019s\n- Column 0: 0=X, 3=O, 6=X \u2192 mixed \u2192 cannot win\n- Column 2: 2=?, 5=X, 8=O \u2192 if O takes 2, it's O-X-O \u2192 not a win\n- Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-O \u2192 complete, not a win\n- Diagonal 2-4-6: 2=?, 4=O, 6=X \u2192 if O takes 2, becomes O-O-X \u2192 not a win\n\n**So the ONLY possible winning line for O is column 1 (1-4-7)**\n\nO already has 4. Needs 1 and 7.\n\nO can get one now, and hopes to get the last one later.\n\nBut currently:\n- Column 1: 1 and 7 are free\n- O to move\n\nSo O must play **one of 1 or 7** to threaten to complete the column.\n\nEither move creates a two-in-a-row on column 1: O-O-? or ?-O-O\n\nBut which is better?\n\nThey are symmetric. Since the board has no other imbalance, **either 1 or 7 is equivalent**.\n\nBut \u2014 **X will block the threat on the next move** if it's not winning.\n\nSo after O plays, say, 1 \u2192 threat at 7 \u2192 X plays 7 \u2192 then O plays 2 \u2192 game draws.\n\nSame if O plays 7 \u2192 X plays 1 \u2192 O plays 2 \u2192 draw.\n\nSo **no winning possibility exists for O** \u2014 only forced draw.\n\nTherefore, **any move that maintains the draw is acceptable**.\n\nBut since 1 and 7 are equal, and 2 is a dead end (no winning line), the expert group recommends playing **1 or 7**, doesn't matter.\n\nBut must pick one.\n\n[All Experts Converge]  \nSince the only meaningful line is column 1, and O must claim one edge of it, and no preference exists between 1 and 7, **choose 1 for symmetry** (top side, like other early moves).\n\nHowever \u2014 wait: after O takes 1, then the board is:\n- Row 0: X-O-2\n- Column 1: O-O-7 open \u2192 threat at 7\n\nBut if next move X blocks at 7, done.\n\nBut what if O plays **2** instead?\n\nThen no threat \u2192 X can take 1 or 7 at leisure \u2192 then blocks column 1 \u2192 O cannot win.\n\nWorse \u2014 if O plays 2, **no threat created**, X can respond anywhere.\n\nSo playing 2 is **passive** \u2014 lets X choose how to block.\n\nBut if O plays 1 or 7, **creates immediate win threat**, forcing X to use their move to block.\n\nThus, O **must** play in column 1 \u2014 either 1 or 7.\n\nChoose **1**.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[7]'",

Check if X has two in a row that could lead to a win on their next move.  \nCurrent board is empty, so no immediate threats. Proceed to assess potential future threats.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for moves that create the most immediate winning opportunities for O. Aim to maximize future lines (rows, columns, diagonals) that could lead to three in a row.  \nCenter (4) is the most powerful square \u2014 it participates in four possible winning lines (middle row, middle column, both diagonals). Strong candidate.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control and long-term positioning. The center (4) offers maximum influence over the game, followed by corners (0, 2, 6, 8), then edges (1, 3, 5, 7).  \nTaking the center first provides best control and flexibility.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Since the board is empty, the only \"threat\" is potential future dominance by X. If X takes center later, it becomes harder to block. Therefore, securing key positions early is defensive.  \nThus, playing in center (4) also serves as preventive defense.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Playing in center (4) maximizes future forks (situations where two winning possibilities arise simultaneously). From center, O can build toward corners and edges efficiently.  \nNo other square offers as many fast win paths. Confirmed: 4 is optimal.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: With no prior moves, first move should claim highest-value square.

No, board only shows one O (4). No immediate blocking needed.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for two X\u2019s anywhere. None so far. Evaluate highest-value remaining positions. Corners (0,2,6,8) offer participation in three lines; edges offer two.  \nSide as X, want to create forks; best path is taking a corner opposite the center to open diagonal play. Candidates: 0, 2, 6, 8.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: With center occupied by O, next critical squares are corners, giving three attacking lines. Edge squares (1,3,5,7) yield only two.  \nAmong corners, since board is symmetric right now, any corner gives equal positional benefit.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Intend to prevent any potential fork by O. O already has center; if X plays edge, O can mirror into corners and create threats. Corners (0,2,6,8) give X balanced defense without allowing O quick skewer threats.  \nAmong corners, 0,2,6,8 equivalent for defense.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: To prepare multiple winning paths, choose a corner. Each corner ties into two diagonals, plus a row & column. A corner plus center diagonal line later could create forks. Any of 0,2,6,8 work equally well for building offensive pressure.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Any corner claim secures symmetric strain-counterplay. Corner (0) is as good as corner (8) and others.

X has only one mark at 0. Check if X has two in a row \u2014 no. But note: X occupies corner 0, O occupies center 4. If X gets 8 (opposite corner), it creates a diagonal threat (0-4-8). Must block that possibility if needed later.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Evaluate current opportunities for O to build winning lines. O has center (4). Best chance is to take a corner \u2014 corners give three possible win paths from center. Ideal move: take a corner that pairs with center for diagonal or row/column. Candidate corners: 2 (top-right), 6 (bottom-left), 8 (bottom-right). Avoid 0 \u2014 already taken.\n\nBut note: if O takes 8, and X took 0, then diagonal 0-4-8 is blocked, but O gains strong presence. Also, taking 2 or 6 opens potential forks.\n\nBut which corner best enables fork potential? Consider that O in 8 and later 2 creates top row threat and right column threat \u2014 could lead to double threat.\n\nWait \u2014 better idea: if O takes a corner *adjacent* to X\u2019s corner, not opposite, it avoids symmetry and may open earlier win. But actual strongest path is to take a corner that allows two potential lines to develop.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: After X takes corner 0, O should aim for another corner to maximize influence. Center + corner gives O control of one diagonal and parts of row/column. Remaining corners: 2, 6, 8. Each is strong. However, taking **8 (opposite corner)** is strategically strongest \u2014 it denies X the diagonal (0-4-8), asserts counter-control, and maintains initiative. This is a classic book move: when opponent takes a corner, responding with opposite corner after controlling center is ideal.\n\nMoreover, occupying 8 gives O:  \n- Diagonal: 2-4-6 (no, wait \u2014 8 connects 0-4-8 diagonal? No \u2014 O is at 4 and 8, so 0-4-8 is O-O-X, which is good \u2014 blocks X from completing it)  \nWait: 0 is X, 4 is O, 8 is candidate. If O takes 8, then diagonal 0-4-8 becomes X-O-O \u2014 not a win for O, but prevents X from ever winning that diagonal. However, O doesn't gain an immediate threat.\n\nBut more importantly, O wants to build toward **own** threats.\n\nBetter: if O takes **2** or **6**, and later secures another corner, can create two-in-a-row with open third.\n\nLet\u2019s reevaluate:\n\nIf O takes **2 (top-right)**:  \n- Then O controls top row (X-O-O) \u2014 not a threat, but future.  \n- O also controls right column (2-5-8) \u2014 open.  \n- And diagonal 2-4-6 \u2014 possible.\n\nSimilarly, if O takes **6 (bottom-left)**:  \n- Left column (0-3-6) \u2014 X and O, but 3 open.  \n- Bottom row (6-7-8) \u2014 open.  \n- Diagonal 6-4-2 \u2014 possible.\n\nBut here's the key: **corner 8 (bottom-right)** is best because:\n- It\u2019s opposite to X\u2019s 0, denying the full diagonal.\n- It gives O strong presence in bottom row and right column.\n- It avoids crowding with X at top-left.\n\nBut wait \u2014 in standard optimal play, after:\n- O1: center (4)\n- X1: corner (0)\nThen **O2 should take the opposite corner (8)** to maximize control and reduce X's counterplay.\n\nYes \u2014 this is well-established in Tic Tac Toe theory.\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: By taking 8, O blocks the 0-4-8 diagonal from ever being used by X and secures a strong corner. This prevents future X fork attempts that rely on symmetry.\n\nNo other move defends against X\u2019s potential as solidly.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: From corner 8 and center 4, O can aim to complete:\n- Diagonal 2-4-6? No \u2014 8 is not on that.\n- Right column: 2-5-8 \u2014 yes.\n- Bottom row: 6-7-8 \u2014 yes.\nSo O can threaten two different lines (bottom row, right column) with proper follow-up.\n\nIf O takes 2 instead, then:\n- Top row: 0-1-2 (X-O-O) \u2014 not useful.\n- Right column: 2-5-8.\n- Diagonal 2-4-6.\n\nStill strong.\n\nBut with X at 0, if O takes 6, then diagonal 6-4-2 opens and left column (0-3-6) has X and O \u2014 less clean.\n\nBest balance: **8** gives O space to expand without direct conflict, controls three lines, and disrupts X\u2019s symmetry.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: The center (4) and opposite corner (8) establish maximum influence. O controls the most critical lines: vertical (3-4-5), horizontal (1-4-7), diagonal (0-4-8 blocked), and gains bottom row and right column from 8.\n\nThis move denies X any quick development and gives O initiative.\n\n**All Experts Now Converging: 8 is best move.**\n\n[All Experts Agree]  \nThe optimal move is [8].\n\n[4] \u2192 [0] \u2192 [8] is classic opening.\n\nFinal decision:  \n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] \n\n[Expert 1 \u2013 Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Scan every row, column, and diagonal for immediate threats from O.  \n- Row 2 (6-7-8): 8 is O, 6 and 7 empty \u2192 one O, not a threat yet.  \n- Column 2 (2-5-8): 8 is O, 2 and 5 empty \u2192 one O.  \n- Diagonals: 0-4-8 has 0 = X, 4 = O, 8 = O \u2192 X-O-O, safe for now. No two-in-a-row for O need blocking on next move.\n\n[Expert 2 \u2013 Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for first possible forks for X (two different lines that could each become XXX with one more X). Current counts:  \n- Corner 0 already held by X. The edge 1 and diagonal 2 positions need evaluation. Early build-up plan: after 0 (corner), taking the opposite corner 7 (bottom-center or top-middle?) Wait \u2014 actually, the pattern that threatens forks fastest for X is \u201ccorner\u2013center\u2013symmetric corner\u201d, but we missed center. After 0 and 4 (taken by O), the next best corner-oriented fork is corner 2 or 6 pairing with 0.  \nHowever, to craft a quick fork here: X needs a cell that simultaneously opens TWO three-in-a-row threats. Scan the lines for placements that give two unblocked twos. Target: corner 2 gives the diagonal 0-4-2 (0 is X, 4 is O) \u2192 safe but doesn\u2019t threaten double. Instead, **corner 6** yields (0-3-6) and (6-7-8) is a row \u2014 not immediate. Essentially, against 0-4-8 opening by O, the only realistic X strategy is to aim to **pair 0 and 6 on a diagonal** and **0 and 2 horizontally** \u2014 yet the key insight is that **edge placement in cells 1, 3, 5, 7 CANNOT make a fork next move**, but CORNER placement CAN prepare diagonal plays. Thus focus on corner 2 or 6.\n\n[Expert 3 \u2013 Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate symmetry and parity. With O sitting at 4+8 (center and one corner), X\u2019s minimal-loss move is to claim another corner to restore balance and threaten future. Among the corners left: 2 (top-right) and 6 (bottom-left). Either captures three lines and resists O center corner edge blitz. Momentum slightly favors 2 \u2014 it neutralizes top-right anchor and sits away from the already claimed 8, giving room for stable fight later.\n\n[Expert 1 \u2013 Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: The stronger defensive guarantee is to reserve corner 6, because it reduces O\u2019s lower-row control (6-7-8 currently has 8=O, 6 and 7 open). By planting X at 6, we force O to fight on that row with only later reinforcements.\n\n[Expert 2 \u2013 Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Exactly; placing X at corner 6 yields:  \n- immediate weak diagonal 0-4-6 (0=X,4=O,6=X) \u2014 not a threat  \n- but places pressure on bottom row 6-7-8, now forcing O to defend instead of press, and also threatens the column 6-3-0, building fork potential in future rows. Confirmed advantage.\n\n[Expert 3 \u2013 Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Once 6 is taken, the board gains mirror symmetry that stymies O fork chances without handing initiative.\n\n[All Experts Agree]  \nThe optimal move is [6].\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] [Expert 1 \u2013 Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Inspect each line for any **immediate two-in-a-row by O** that needs an instant block.  \n- Row 1 (3-4-5): 3=O, 4=O \u2192 O-O-empty. **Threat detected!** If 5 is left open, O will win next move with 3-4-5.  \n- All other rows/columns/diagonals have at most one O, so no other threats.\n\n[Expert 2 \u2013 Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Search for a **fork opportunity for X**\u2014a single move that would simultaneously create two separate three-in-a-row threats.  \n- Cell 2: would create top row (0-1-2) and diagonal (2-4-6). However, 4 is O, so 2-4-6 would be 2-X-O and cannot become a threat.  \n- Cell 1: would create top row (0-1-2) and middle column (1-4-7). Again 4 is O, so column 1-4-7 is not a threat.  \nResult: **no fork exists for X at this moment**; therefore, priority shifts to **defensive necessity**\u2014blocking the immediate O win.\n\n[Expert 3 \u2013 Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: With O threatening at 3-4-5, X **must** occupy 5 to prevent loss. Any other move (corner 2, edge 1 or 7) would allow O to play 5 next and win. Positional niceties are irrelevant when a forced block exists.\n\n[All Experts Agree]  \nThe only correct move is [5].\n\n[5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [Expert 1 \u2013 Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Scan for immediate threats from O.  \n- Check row 0: X, 1, 2 \u2192 only one X, no threat.  \n- Row 1: O, O, X \u2192 full, no threat.  \n- Row 2: X, 7, O \u2192 no two in a row.  \n- Column 0: X, O, X \u2192 X-O-X, no immediate threat.  \n- Column 1: 1, O, 7 \u2192 one O, no threat.  \n- Column 2: 2, X, O \u2192 one of each.  \n- Diagonal 0-4-8: X, O, O \u2192 not a threat for X or O.  \n- Diagonal 2-4-6: 2, O, X \u2192 O in center, no two in a row.  \n\nNo two O\u2019s in any line with open third cell. **No immediate win threat from O.**\n\n[Expert 2 \u2013 Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Search for a move that creates a **fork** or **immediate two-in-a-row with open extension** for O.  \nAvailable moves: 1, 2, 7.  \nTry each:\n\n- Play 1: O at 1 \u2192  \n  - Row 0: X-O-2 \u2192 could become X-O-O but not a threat yet.  \n  - Column 1: O at 1, O at 4, 7 open \u2192 O-O-open \u2192 **potential win on next move if 7 is free**.  \n  \u2192 Creates **one potential two-in-a-row** (column 1), but not a fork.\n\n- Play 2: O at 2 \u2192  \n  - Row 0: X-1-O \u2192 not a threat.  \n  - Column 2: O at 2, X at 5, O at 8 \u2192 already has O-X-O \u2192 not a winning line.  \n  - Diagonal 0-4-8: full \u2192 no.  \n  - No two O\u2019s in any line \u2192 no threat built.\n\n- Play 7: O at 7 \u2192  \n  - Row 2: X-O-O \u2192 could win if extended, but already has X-O-O \u2192 no third for O.  \n  - Column 1: 1, O, O \u2192 O at 4 and 7 \u2192 same as above: **if O takes 7, then column 1 becomes ?-O-O**, and if 1 is still open, **O will have a winning threat at 1 next move**.  \n  Wait \u2014 same as move 1? Actually, no:  \n  - If O takes 7, column 1 is 1 (empty), 4 (O), 7 (O) \u2192 O-O-open, so **threat at 1 next move**.  \n  - Also, row 2: 6 (X), 7 (O), 8 (O) \u2192 already complete, not a win.\n\nSo both 1 and 7 create one two-in-a-row threat. But is there a **fork**?\n\nTest: after O plays 1 \u2192  \n- O has 1 and 4 \u2192 column 1 is O-O, needs 7 to win.  \n- O has 1 and ? \u2014 no other line.  \nAfter O plays 7 \u2192  \n- O has 4 and 7 \u2192 column 1 is O-O, needs 1 to win.  \n- O has 7 and 8 \u2192 row 2 is X-O-O \u2192 not a win.  \n- No second threat.\n\nBut **crucially** \u2014 if O takes **1**, then:\n- Column 1: O-O (1 and 4), 7 open \u2192 threat at 7\n- Row 0: X-O (0 and 1), 2 open \u2192 not a threat\n\u2192 still one threat\n\nSame for 7 \u2192 only one threat\n\nWait \u2014 is there a better way?\n\nNo fork possible in one move.\n\nBut \u2014 **look deeper**: if O takes **1**, threatening to win at 7 (column 1) next move, and X blocks at 7, then O can play 2 \u2192 top row: X-O-O \u2192 not a win.\n\nAlternatively, if O takes **7**, threatening to win at 1 (column 1), X blocks at 1, then O plays 2 \u2192 still no win.\n\nBut \u2014 **diagonal**?\n\nNo O diagonal possible.\n\nWait \u2014 **what about row 0?**\n\nCurrently: 0=X, 1=?, 2=?\n\nIf O takes 1, then 0=X, 1=O, 2=?  \nNo win there.\n\nAlternatively \u2014 **only real threat is column 1**, whichever of 1 or 7 O plays, it creates a two-in-a-row with the center.\n\nBut which one to pick?\n\n[Expert 3 \u2013 Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate position control.  \n- Both 1 and 7 are edge (side) squares \u2014 low value, only in two lines each.  \n- However, move 1 (top middle) opens **opportunity to influence row 0** and **column 1**.  \n- Move 7 (bottom middle) opens **column 1** and **row 2**, but row 2 already has X and O at ends \u2192 cannot be completed by O (0-based: 6=X, 8=O). So row 2 cannot be a win for O.\n\n**Therefore, 7 is on a dead row** \u2014 no winning possibility along row 2 for O (6=X, 7=?, 8=O \u2192 even if O plays 7, it's X-O-O \u2192 not three O\u2019s).  \nSo playing 7 gives only **column 1** as a future line.\n\nBut playing 1:\n- Column 1: O-O at 1 and 4 \u2192 threat on 7\n- Row 0: X-O-? \u2192 if 2 is available, can become X-O-O \u2014 again, not a win for O.\n\nSo both are equal? But wait \u2014 **only one move creates a threat that isn't already blocked**.\n\nActually \u2014 **column 1 is the only viable winning line left for O**:\n- Needs two of 1, 4, 7\n- 4 is O\n- So must take both 1 and 7 to complete column 1\n\nThus, O must play **one of 1 or 7 now**, creating a two-in-a-row threat.\n\nBut if O plays 7, then row 2 is full (6=X, 7=O, 8=O) \u2192 harmless\nAnd column 1 is O at 4 and 7 \u2192 threatens 1\n\nIf O plays 1, then column 1 is O at 1 and 4 \u2192 threatens 7\n\nSame threat.\n\nBut \u2014 **which cell allows a fork if X fails to block**?\n\nNo fork \u2014 either way, X will block the single threat.\n\nBut \u2014 is there any **difference in control**?\n\nWait \u2014 **no other winning line possible for O**:\n- Row 0: 0=X \u2192 if O takes 1 and 2, it's X-O-O \u2192 not a win\n- Row 1: full\n- Row 2: 6=X, 8=O \u2192 even with 7, not three O\u2019s\n- Column 0: 0=X, 3=O, 6=X \u2192 mixed \u2192 cannot win\n- Column 2: 2=?, 5=X, 8=O \u2192 if O takes 2, it's O-X-O \u2192 not a win\n- Diagonal 0-4-8: X-O-O \u2192 complete, not a win\n- Diagonal 2-4-6: 2=?, 4=O, 6=X \u2192 if O takes 2, becomes O-O-X \u2192 not a win\n\n**So the ONLY possible winning line for O is column 1 (1-4-7)**\n\nO already has 4. Needs 1 and 7.\n\nO can get one now, and hopes to get the last one later.\n\nBut currently:\n- Column 1: 1 and 7 are free\n- O to move\n\nSo O must play **one of 1 or 7** to threaten to complete the column.\n\nEither move creates a two-in-a-row on column 1: O-O-? or ?-O-O\n\nBut which is better?\n\nThey are symmetric. Since the board has no other imbalance, **either 1 or 7 is equivalent**.\n\nBut \u2014 **X will block the threat on the next move** if it's not winning.\n\nSo after O plays, say, 1 \u2192 threat at 7 \u2192 X plays 7 \u2192 then O plays 2 \u2192 game draws.\n\nSame if O plays 7 \u2192 X plays 1 \u2192 O plays 2 \u2192 draw.\n\nSo **no winning possibility exists for O** \u2014 only forced draw.\n\nTherefore, **any move that maintains the draw is acceptable**.\n\nBut since 1 and 7 are equal, and 2 is a dead end (no winning line), the expert group recommends playing **1 or 7**, doesn't matter.\n\nBut must pick one.\n\n[All Experts Converge]  \nSince the only meaningful line is column 1, and O must claim one edge of it, and no preference exists between 1 and 7, **choose 1 for symmetry** (top side, like other early moves).\n\nHowever \u2014 wait: after O takes 1, then the board is:\n- Row 0: X-O-2\n- Column 1: O-O-7 open \u2192 threat at 7\n\nBut if next move X blocks at 7, done.\n\nBut what if O plays **2** instead?\n\nThen no threat \u2192 X can take 1 or 7 at leisure \u2192 then blocks column 1 \u2192 O cannot win.\n\nWorse \u2014 if O plays 2, **no threat created**, X can respond anywhere.\n\nSo playing 2 is **passive** \u2014 lets X choose how to block.\n\nBut if O plays 1 or 7, **creates immediate win threat**, forcing X to use their move to block.\n\nThus, O **must** play in column 1 \u2014 either 1 or 7.\n\nChoose **1**.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] [Expert 1 \u2013 Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Scan for any immediate threat by O.  \n- O currently occupies 1, 3, 4, 8.  \n- Check every row/column/diagonal:  \n  \u2022 Row 0: X-O-open (cells 0-1-2) \u2013 two symbols, but different players; no threat.  \n  \u2022 Row 1: O-O-X \u2013 already full \u2192 no threat.  \n  \u2022 Row 2: X-open-O \u2013 need two O \u2192 impossible.  \n  \u2022 Column 0: X-O-X \u2013 already full \u2192 no threat.  \n  \u2022 Column 1: O-O-open \u2013 two O\u2019s with 7 free.
