I will check if 'X' is two in a row and ready to win in the next turn. If 'X' has two in a row anywhere, I need to block that position. For example, if 'X' has occupied positions [0] and [1], I must place 'O' in [2] to prevent them from winning.\n\n**Offensive Tactician:**  \nI want to look for opportunities to win this turn. If there is a chance for me to create two in a row and force the opponent to block me, that's ideal. If I have two 'O's already placed, I should identify where I can place my third 'O' to win. For example, if I have 'O' at [0] and [1], placing 'O' at [2] gives me the win.\n\n**Positional Expert:**  \nIt's crucial to place my 'O' in such a way that I maintain control over the board and limit my opponent's options.
