The top row (0-1-2) and left column (0-3-6) are active lines:  \n- Playing at 2 (top-right) creates a two-in-a-row threat in the top row (0 and 2), forcing O to block at 1 next turn.  \n- Playing at 6 (bottom-left) creates a two-in-a-row threat in the left column (0 and 6), forcing O to block at 3 next turn.  \n- Playing at 5 (middle-right) offers no strong immediate threat, as O controls the center, making middle row development less impactful. Corners 2 and 6 maximize offensive pressure by leveraging corner strength (3 winning lines each).\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* O controls the center (4) and one corner (8), while I control top-left (0). The remaining corners (top-right 2 and bottom-left 6) are symmetrically equivalent and optimal:  \n- Corners participate in 3 winning lines (vs. edges' 2), providing maximum board influence.  \n- Playing at 2 or 6 secures a second corner, balancing the board and limiting O's central dominance.  \n- Edge squares (1, 3, 5, 7) are weaker; 5 is less valuable than corners as it only supports row/column lines without diagonal benefits. Corners align best with counter-controlling O's position.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* After eliminating dangerous edges (1, 3, 7), safe moves are corners 2/6 and edge 5. However, 5 (middle-right) does not force O into a defensive reply\u2014it allows O to build threats freely (e.g., O could target diagonal 2-4-6). Playing at 2 or 6 is superior:  \n- If X plays at 2, O must block the top row at 1, preventing O from creating multiple threats immediately.  \n- Similarly, playing at 6 forces O to block the left column at 3.  \nThis avoids forks while maintaining safety. 5 is riskier as it gives O initiative.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Playing at 2 or 6 generates an instant two-in-a-row that O must address, ceding me tempo:  \n- 2 creates top row pressure (0-2), threatening win at 1.  \n- 6 creates left column pressure (0-6), threatening win at 3.  \n- 5 offers no comparable threat, letting O develop actively (e.g., O could target diagonal 2-4-6). Corners also position X for future forks (e.g., after O blocks, X can threaten multiple lines). 2 is conventionally preferred for consistency with top-side development.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Corners 2 and 6 both reinforce X's control:  \n- 2 completes top-row influence and counters O's corner (8) via diagonal symmetry.  \n- 6 solidifies left-column control and mirrors O's (8) for balanced board presence.  \n- Due to rotational symmetry, 2 and 6 are equally strong, but 2 aligns with opening trends (top-side play). Edge 5 is suboptimal\u2014it only intersects two lines and cedes corner value to O. Securing a second corner maximizes flexibility for mid-game.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**  \nPlaying at **2** (top-right corner) is optimal. It avoids defensive weaknesses (no fork risk), creates an immediate offensive threat forcing O to block, and secures a high-value corner for positional dominance. This move balances safety, initiative, and board control\u2014critical for countering O's central strength.\n\n[2]",

I must now prevent 'O' from building multiple threats around the center. As Player 1 (X), I should avoid edges and aim for a corner, as corners are harder to exploit against and offer better counter-control.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* Since O controls the center, I need to establish a strong presence that allows multiple paths to victory. Corners are best for this because they each contribute to three potential lines. I'll prioritize a corner to maximize future offensive setups.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* The center is taken by O, so the next best positions are the corners. Each corner (0, 2, 6, 8) intersects three winning lines and counters central control effectively. Taking a corner gives X balanced influence and limits O\u2019s dominance.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* If I don\u2019t take a corner, O can potentially fork me later by threatening two lines at once. Corners are safest \u2014 especially opposite corners \u2014 so I should take one now to deny such setups.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Taking a corner allows me to build two potential lines (one row, one column, and possibly a diagonal). The diagonal from corner to corner through center is powerful. Since O has center, playing in a corner gives me a foothold on one diagonal.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Corner squares are superior when center is occupied by the opponent. Of all corners, it doesn\u2019t matter which one I pick initially due to symmetry. I\u2019ll pick top-left (0) as it\u2019s conventionally optimal and maximizes flexibility.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**  \nPlaying in a corner, specifically position 0, is the best response to O taking the center.\n\n[0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 1:* My primary focus is to prevent 'X' from creating a winning line or a fork (two winning threats). 'X' has taken corner 0 and 'O' has center 4. This creates a diagonal line (0-4-8) that 'X' could complete. My next move should block this immediate threat.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has played in a corner. My goal as 'O' is to create my own winning opportunities. The center position I occupy is crucial for this. I need to extend my influence from the center to set up multiple potential lines.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has taken a corner, which is a strong positional play against a central 'O'. My task is to maintain control and leverage my central position. I should consider squares that interact with 'X's corner and my center, providing crucial board control.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The most immediate and dangerous threat 'X' can pose is by taking the opposite corner (8) to complete a diagonal with their current position (0) and my center (4). Therefore, I must immediately block cell 8.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* By playing in corner 8, I not only create a potentially winning diagonal (0-4-8) for myself if 'X' had not taken 0, but by playing there now, I create two new active lines for 'O' (row 6-7-8 and column 2-5-8) that pass through a corner. This also sets up a potential fork if X doesn't block properly. This is the optimal offensive move given 'X's play.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* Taking the opposite corner (8) creates a powerful symmetric setup with my central 'O' and 'X's corner 'X' (0). This move reinforces my central control, covers a major diagonal, and sets up multiple future winning possibilities by creating symmetrical threats. It also immediately blocks a potential winning line for 'X'.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**\nPlacing 'O' in position 8 is the strongest move, as it blocks 'X's potential diagonal win while simultaneously creating offensive potential and reinforcing 'O's central dominance.]\n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] ### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* Player 0 (O) has occupied the center (4) and bottom-right corner (8).

Currently, O does not have an immediate two-in-a-row, but certain moves by X (e.g., playing on edge squares like 1, 3, or 7) would allow O to create a fork next turn. For example:  \n- If X plays at 1 (top-center), O can respond at 2, creating threats at 5 and 6 (column 2 and diagonal 2-4-6).  \n- If X plays at 3 (left-center), O can respond at 6, creating threats at 2 and 7 (diagonal 2-4-6 and bottom row).  \n- If X plays at 7 (bottom-center), O can respond at 2, creating threats at 5 and 6 (column 2 and diagonal 2-4-6).  \nThus, I must avoid edge squares 1, 3, and 7 to prevent O from forking.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* I (X) have a mark at top-left (0).

      "response": "### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has placed marks in 0 and 2, which are corners, and 'O' has marks in the center (4) and corner 8. My primary concern is identifying any immediate threats from 'X'. 'X' has two marks (0 and 2) in the top row. This means if 'X' plays in position 1, they would win. Therefore, my immediate defensive priority is to block position 1.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has established a two-in-a-row in the top row (0 and 2). My goal is to create winning lines for myself and capitalize on my central 'O' (4) and corner 'O' (8) advantage. Playing on 1 will prevent 'X' from winning, but I also need to find a move that sets up my own win or a strong threat.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has occupied two corners (0 and 2), while 'O' holds the center (4) and another corner (8). The board is starting to fill up. My central 'O' is very powerful. I need to continue to influence lines that branch from my central piece. The square 1 is a blocking move, but also a strategic one as it connects with my 'O' in 4 (via the column 1-4-7) and also forms part of the 0-1-2 row.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The most critical defensive move is to block 'X's winning line on the top row. This means placing 'O' in position 1. Failure to do so would result in 'X' winning on their next turn.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* While blocking 'X' at 1 is mandatory, it's also a good offensive move. By placing 'O' at 1, I establish a new two-in-a-row with 'O' in 4 (column 1-4-7). This forces 'X' to react to my threat in the future or allows me to complete this line. It also means my 'O's are now spread across a row (0-1-2, with O at 1), a column (1-4-7, with O at 1 and 4), and a diagonal (0-4-8, with O at 4 and 8), giving me more flexibility.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* Placing 'O' in position 1 is a forced move from a defensive standpoint, but it also has strong positional benefits. It controls the center of the top edge, participating in the top row and the middle column. This further solidifies 'O's central control, extending influence upwards and creating a strong line with 'O' at 4. This move prevents 'X's immediate win and continues to build 'O's strategic control over the board.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**\nPlacing 'O' in position 1 is the critical and optimal move. It immediately blocks 'X's winning line and simultaneously creates a new offensive line for 'O'.\n\n[1]",

My goal is to create immediate two-in-a-row threats to pressure O into defensive moves. The top row (0-1-2) and left column (0-3-6) are active lines:  \n- Playing at 2 (top-right) creates a two-in-a-row threat in the top row (0 and 2), forcing O to block at 1 next turn.  \n- Playing at 6 (bottom-left) creates a two-in-a-row threat in the left column (0 and 6), forcing O to block at 3 next turn.  \n- Playing at 5 (middle-right) offers no strong immediate threat, as O controls the center, making middle row development less impactful. Corners 2 and 6 maximize offensive pressure by leveraging corner strength (3 winning lines each).\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* O controls the center (4) and one corner (8), while I control top-left (0). The remaining corners (top-right 2 and bottom-left 6) are symmetrically equivalent and optimal:  \n- Corners participate in 3 winning lines (vs. edges' 2), providing maximum board influence.  \n- Playing at 2 or 6 secures a second corner, balancing the board and limiting O's central dominance.  \n- Edge squares (1, 3, 5, 7) are weaker; 5 is less valuable than corners as it only supports row/column lines without diagonal benefits. Corners align best with counter-controlling O's position.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* After eliminating dangerous edges (1, 3, 7), safe moves are corners 2/6 and edge 5. However, 5 (middle-right) does not force O into a defensive reply\u2014it allows O to build threats freely (e.g., O could target diagonal 2-4-6). Playing at 2 or 6 is superior:  \n- If X plays at 2, O must block the top row at 1, preventing O from creating multiple threats immediately.  \n- Similarly, playing at 6 forces O to block the left column at 3.  \nThis avoids forks while maintaining safety. 5 is riskier as it gives O initiative.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Playing at 2 or 6 generates an instant two-in-a-row that O must address, ceding me tempo:  \n- 2 creates top row pressure (0-2), threatening win at 1.  \n- 6 creates left column pressure (0-6), threatening win at 3.  \n- 5 offers no comparable threat, letting O develop actively (e.g., O could target diagonal 2-4-6). Corners also position X for future forks (e.g., after O blocks, X can threaten multiple lines). 2 is conventionally preferred for consistency with top-side development.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Corners 2 and 6 both reinforce X's control:  \n- 2 completes top-row influence and counters O's corner (8) via diagonal symmetry.  \n- 6 solidifies left-column control and mirrors O's (8) for balanced board presence.  \n- Due to rotational symmetry, 2 and 6 are equally strong, but 2 aligns with opening trends (top-side play). Edge 5 is suboptimal\u2014it only intersects two lines and cedes corner value to O. Securing a second corner maximizes flexibility for mid-game.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**  \nPlaying at **2** (top-right corner) is optimal. It avoids defensive weaknesses (no fork risk), creates an immediate offensive threat forcing O to block, and secures a high-value corner for positional dominance. This move balances safety, initiative, and board control\u2014critical for countering O's central strength.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] ### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has placed marks in 0 and 2, which are corners, and 'O' has marks in the center (4) and corner 8. My primary concern is identifying any immediate threats from 'X'. 'X' has two marks (0 and 2) in the top row. This means if 'X' plays in position 1, they would win. Therefore, my immediate defensive priority is to block position 1.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has established a two-in-a-row in the top row (0 and 2). My goal is to create winning lines for myself and capitalize on my central 'O' (4) and corner 'O' (8) advantage. Playing on 1 will prevent 'X' from winning, but I also need to find a move that sets up my own win or a strong threat.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has occupied two corners (0 and 2), while 'O' holds the center (4) and another corner (8). The board is starting to fill up. My central 'O' is very powerful. I need to continue to influence lines that branch from my central piece. The square 1 is a blocking move, but also a strategic one as it connects with my 'O' in 4 (via the column 1-4-7) and also forms part of the 0-1-2 row.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The most critical defensive move is to block 'X's winning line on the top row. This means placing 'O' in position 1. Failure to do so would result in 'X' winning on their next turn.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* While blocking 'X' at 1 is mandatory, it's also a good offensive move. By placing 'O' at 1, I establish a new two-in-a-row with 'O' in 4 (column 1-4-7). This forces 'X' to react to my threat in the future or allows me to complete this line. It also means my 'O's are now spread across a row (0-1-2, with O at 1), a column (1-4-7, with O at 1 and 4), and a diagonal (0-4-8, with O at 4 and 8), giving me more flexibility.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* Placing 'O' in position 1 is a forced move from a defensive standpoint, but it also has strong positional benefits. It controls the center of the top edge, participating in the top row and the middle column. This further solidifies 'O's central control, extending influence upwards and creating a strong line with 'O' at 4. This move prevents 'X's immediate win and continues to build 'O's strategic control over the board.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**\nPlacing 'O' in position 1 is the critical and optimal move. It immediately blocks 'X's winning line and simultaneously creates a new offensive line for 'O'.\n\n[1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'",

On an empty board, I should consider moves that open up the most potential winning opportunities.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* I'm looking for moves that grant control over key areas of the board, especially those that participate in multiple winning lines.

I must now prevent 'O' from building multiple threats around the center. As Player 1 (X), I should avoid edges and aim for a corner, as corners are harder to exploit against and offer better counter-control.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* Since O controls the center, I need to establish a strong presence that allows multiple paths to victory. Corners are best for this because they each contribute to three potential lines. I'll prioritize a corner to maximize future offensive setups.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* The center is taken by O, so the next best positions are the corners. Each corner (0, 2, 6, 8) intersects three winning lines and counters central control effectively. Taking a corner gives X balanced influence and limits O\u2019s dominance.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* If I don\u2019t take a corner, O can potentially fork me later by threatening two lines at once. Corners are safest \u2014 especially opposite corners \u2014 so I should take one now to deny such setups.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Taking a corner allows me to build two potential lines (one row, one column, and possibly a diagonal). The diagonal from corner to corner through center is powerful. Since O has center, playing in a corner gives me a foothold on one diagonal.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Corner squares are superior when center is occupied by the opponent. Of all corners, it doesn\u2019t matter which one I pick initially due to symmetry. I\u2019ll pick top-left (0) as it\u2019s conventionally optimal and maximizes flexibility.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**  \nPlaying in a corner, specifically position 0, is the best response to O taking the center.\n\n[0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 1:* My primary focus is to prevent 'X' from creating a winning line or a fork (two winning threats). 'X' has taken corner 0 and 'O' has center 4. This creates a diagonal line (0-4-8) that 'X' could complete. My next move should block this immediate threat.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has played in a corner. My goal as 'O' is to create my own winning opportunities. The center position I occupy is crucial for this. I need to extend my influence from the center to set up multiple potential lines.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has taken a corner, which is a strong positional play against a central 'O'. My task is to maintain control and leverage my central position. I should consider squares that interact with 'X's corner and my center, providing crucial board control.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The most immediate and dangerous threat 'X' can pose is by taking the opposite corner (8) to complete a diagonal with their current position (0) and my center (4). Therefore, I must immediately block cell 8.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* By playing in corner 8, I not only create a potentially winning diagonal (0-4-8) for myself if 'X' had not taken 0, but by playing there now, I create two new active lines for 'O' (row 6-7-8 and column 2-5-8) that pass through a corner. This also sets up a potential fork if X doesn't block properly. This is the optimal offensive move given 'X's play.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* Taking the opposite corner (8) creates a powerful symmetric setup with my central 'O' and 'X's corner 'X' (0). This move reinforces my central control, covers a major diagonal, and sets up multiple future winning possibilities by creating symmetrical threats. It also immediately blocks a potential winning line for 'X'.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**\nPlacing 'O' in position 8 is the strongest move, as it blocks 'X's potential diagonal win while simultaneously creating offensive potential and reinforcing 'O's central dominance.]\n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] ### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* Player 0 (O) has occupied the center (4) and bottom-right corner (8). As Player 1 (X), I must prioritize blocking potential forks where O could threaten two winning lines simultaneously. Currently, O does not have an immediate two-in-a-row, but certain moves by X (e.g., playing on edge squares like 1, 3, or 7) would allow O to create a fork next turn. For example:  \n- If X plays at 1 (top-center), O can respond at 2, creating threats at 5 and 6 (column 2 and diagonal 2-4-6).  \n- If X plays at 3 (left-center), O can respond at 6, creating threats at 2 and 7 (diagonal 2-4-6 and bottom row).  \n- If X plays at 7 (bottom-center), O can respond at 2, creating threats at 5 and 6 (column 2 and diagonal 2-4-6).  \nThus, I must avoid edge squares 1, 3, and 7 to prevent O from forking.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* I (X) have a mark at top-left (0). My goal is to create immediate two-in-a-row threats to pressure O into defensive moves.

I need to check for immediate threats or potential forks from 'X'.\n- X has 0, 2, 7.\n- No direct 2-in-a-row for X that would lead to a win on their next turn.\n- No immediate threat of a fork from X.\nMy primary defensive goal is to ensure O cannot be immediately outmaneuvered, and to respond to X's last move (7).\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* I have 'O' at 1, 4, 8. 'X' is at 0, 2, 7. I need to identify where I can create a two-in-a-row to put pressure on X or set up a future win.\n- I have O at 4 and 8. Taking 6 would create a diagonal 6-4-2 (potential win if X wasn't at 2) and a row 6-7-8 (potential win if X wasn't at 7). Since X is at 7, 6 does next make a 2-in-a-row for myself on the bottom.\n- My O at 1 and 4 makes a two-in-a-row down the middle column. If I play at 7, I would win, but X is already there. So the 1-4-7 column is blocked for me.\n- My O at 4 and 8 forms part of the diagonal 0-4-8. X is at 0, so that line is blocked for me.\n- I need to establish a new 2-in-a-row or build towards a fork. The available cells are 3, 5, 6.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* My 'O's are at 1 (top-center), 4 (center), and 8 (bottom-right corner). 'X's are at 0 (top-left corner), 2 (top-right corner), and 7 (bottom-center). I need to consider which available square (3, 5, 6) offers the best strategic advantage, considering both defensive and offensive implications.\n- Square 3 (middle-left) is on the same row as O at 4, and X at 0.\n- Square 5 (middle-right) is on the same row as O at 4, and X at 2.\n- Square 6 (bottom-left corner) is on the same row as O at 8, and X at 7. It also connects to X at 0.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* 'X' used their last move (7) to block my potential win on the 1-4-7 column. This means X is thinking defensively as well. Now I need to see where 'X' might create a future threat.\n- X has 0, 2, 7.\n- If X takes 3, they threaten 0-3-6. O has 4.\n- If X takes 5, they threaten 2-5-8. O has 4.\n- If X takes 6, they threaten 0-6-3. O has 4, and 8.\nMy current strategy should focus on blocking any future 2-in-a-row for X, and critically, positions that setup a fork for X.\n- If X gets 3 and 6, they don't get a fork as 0 is blocked.\n- If X gets 5 and 6, no direct fork.\n\nLet's re-evaluate X's potential win conditions.\nX currently has two in a row on the top (0,2) but my O at 1 blocks it.\nX has 0, 7. This does not pose an immediate threat.\nX has 2, 7. This does not pose an immediate threat.\nThe most dangerous squares for X to acquire are those that complete a line. No such square exists for X currently.\nMy defensive move should anticipate X's next move and prevent a fork.\nConsider if I place an O in 3. X cannot create a two-in-a-row.\nConsider if I place an O in 5. X cannot create a two-in-a-row.\nConsider if I place an O in 6. X cannot create a two-in-a-row.\n\nMy goal is to stop X from making a two-in-a-row AND from creating a fork.\nIf I play at 3, I get a two-in-a-row with 4 (3,4,5). After I play 3, the board is:\nX O X\nO O 5\n6 X O\nIf X then plays 5, they get 2-5-8. I would have to block at 6.\nBut if I play 5 instead.\nX O X\n3 O O\n6 X O\nThen X can play at 3 and get line 0-3-6. I block at 6.\nIf I play at 6.\nX O X\n3 O 5\nO X O\nThen X can play at 3 forming 0-3-6 or 5 forming 2-5-8. This looks like a better option.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* My 'O's are at 1, 4, 8. I am looking for a move (3, 5, or 6) that creates an immediate win threat or a strong potential fork.\n- If I play 3: I create O-O at 3,4. This threatens a win at 5. (3-4-5) X would have to block at 5.\n- If I play 5: I create O-O at 4,5. This threatens a win at 3. (3-4-5) X would have to block at 3.\n- If I play 6: I create O-O at 6,8 (with X at 7, the row is blocked). I also create O-X-O at 0-X-6, so this doesn't help me yet. But I create a diagonal 6-4-2. X is at 2, so this blocks X's diagonal now.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the offensive potential of 3, 5, and 6:\n- **Playing at 3:** Creates a two-in-a-row with my 'O' at 4 (line 3-4-5). This forces 'X' to block at 5 on their next move. This is a strong offensive move as it forces a reaction from X.\n- **Playing at 5:** Creates a two-in-a-row with my 'O' at 4 (line 3-4-5). This forces 'X' to block at 3 on their next move. This is equally strong as playing at 3 due to symmetry.\n- **Playing at 6:** This creates an 'O' in a corner. It also forms a two-in-a-row for me with 8 (6-7-8) but X is at 7 so this row is useless. It does connect to my 'O' at 4-6 on the diagonal 2-4-6. X is at 2, so this blocks X from winning that diagonal. But it doesn't create an immediate 2-in-a-row for myself on the next move that X has to block.\n\nTherefore, 3 or 5 are the strongest offensive moves as they immediately threaten a win.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* I want to maintain control and leverage my existing 'O's at 1, 4, 8.\n- **Playing at 3:** Creates a strong horizontal line with 4 and 5. It establishes O at an advantageous position relative to X at 0. It also helps control the left side of the board.\n- **Playing at 5:** Symmetrical to 3. Creates a strong horizontal line with 3 and 4. Establishes O at an advantageous position relative to X at 2. Helps control the right side of the board.\n- **Playing at 6:** This is a corner. It supports the diagonal 2-4-6, connecting to X at 2 and my O at 4. This is a good defensive move to block X on that diagonal, but it doesn't immediately extend my O's influence into a new line of threat as strongly as 3 or 5. Acquiring a second corner (after 8) balances my board control.\n\nBoth 3 and 5 are strong as they leverage the central 'O' (4) to create immediate threats on the 3-4-5 row, while also securing an edge position. 6 is also good as a corner position, but it doesn't immediately create a 2-in-a-row threat for O. Given that 3 and 5 are symmetrically equal and create an immediate threat, they are positionally stronger for creating an active threat. I will lean towards 3 for left-side board control.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**\nThe primary goal is to create a two-in-a-row for 'O' that 'X' must block. Both 3 and 5 achieve this by forming a line with the central 'O' at 4. Due to symmetry, both are equally strong. Let's choose 3 since it is the lowest available numeric option.\n\n[3]",

Since the board is empty, there are no immediate threats yet.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* My goal is to create multiple winning lines for 'O'. On an empty board, I should consider moves that open up the most potential winning opportunities.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* I'm looking for moves that grant control over key areas of the board, especially those that participate in multiple winning lines. The center square is usually the most powerful initial move.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* With no threats, my defensive strategy is to still play a solid opening move that doesn't inadvertently leave easy openings for 'X'. A central or corner position is generally safe.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The center square (4) participates in four out of the eight possible winning lines, more than any other square. This makes it the strongest offensive opening.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The center square (4) connects all rows, columns, and diagonals, making it the most strategically important square for board control. It allows 'O' to influence the greatest number of potential winning lines.\n\n4]\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* Player 0 (O) has taken the center square (4), which is a strong move. I must now prevent 'O' from building multiple threats around the center. As Player 1 (X), I should avoid edges and aim for a corner, as corners are harder to exploit against and offer better counter-control.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* Since O controls the center, I need to establish a strong presence that allows multiple paths to victory. Corners are best for this because they each contribute to three potential lines. I'll prioritize a corner to maximize future offensive setups.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* The center is taken by O, so the next best positions are the corners. Each corner (0, 2, 6, 8) intersects three winning lines and counters central control effectively. Taking a corner gives X balanced influence and limits O\u2019s dominance.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* If I don\u2019t take a corner, O can potentially fork me later by threatening two lines at once. Corners are safest \u2014 especially opposite corners \u2014 so I should take one now to deny such setups.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Taking a corner allows me to build two potential lines (one row, one column, and possibly a diagonal). The diagonal from corner to corner through center is powerful. Since O has center, playing in a corner gives me a foothold on one diagonal.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Corner squares are superior when center is occupied by the opponent. Of all corners, it doesn\u2019t matter which one I pick initially due to symmetry. I\u2019ll pick top-left (0) as it\u2019s conventionally optimal and maximizes flexibility.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**  \nPlaying in a corner, specifically position 0, is the best response to O taking the center.\n\n[0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 1:* My primary focus is to prevent 'X' from creating a winning line or a fork (two winning threats). 'X' has taken corner 0 and 'O' has center 4. This creates a diagonal line (0-4-8) that 'X' could complete. My next move should block this immediate threat.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has played in a corner. My goal as 'O' is to create my own winning opportunities. The center position I occupy is crucial for this. I need to extend my influence from the center to set up multiple potential lines.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has taken a corner, which is a strong positional play against a central 'O'. My task is to maintain control and leverage my central position. I should consider squares that interact with 'X's corner and my center, providing crucial board control.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The most immediate and dangerous threat 'X' can pose is by taking the opposite corner (8) to complete a diagonal with their current position (0) and my center (4). Therefore, I must immediately block cell 8.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* By playing in corner 8, I not only create a potentially winning diagonal (0-4-8) for myself if 'X' had not taken 0, but by playing there now, I create two new active lines for 'O' (row 6-7-8 and column 2-5-8) that pass through a corner. This also sets up a potential fork if X doesn't block properly. This is the optimal offensive move given 'X's play.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* Taking the opposite corner (8) creates a powerful symmetric setup with my central 'O' and 'X's corner 'X' (0). This move reinforces my central control, covers a major diagonal, and sets up multiple future winning possibilities by creating symmetrical threats. It also immediately blocks a potential winning line for 'X'.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**\nPlacing 'O' in position 8 is the strongest move, as it blocks 'X's potential diagonal win while simultaneously creating offensive potential and reinforcing 'O's central dominance.]\n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] ### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* Player 0 (O) has occupied the center (4) and bottom-right corner (8). As Player 1 (X), I must prioritize blocking potential forks where O could threaten two winning lines simultaneously. Currently, O does not have an immediate two-in-a-row, but certain moves by X (e.g., playing on edge squares like 1, 3, or 7) would allow O to create a fork next turn. For example:  \n- If X plays at 1 (top-center), O can respond at 2, creating threats at 5 and 6 (column 2 and diagonal 2-4-6).  \n- If X plays at 3 (left-center), O can respond at 6, creating threats at 2 and 7 (diagonal 2-4-6 and bottom row).  \n- If X plays at 7 (bottom-center), O can respond at 2, creating threats at 5 and 6 (column 2 and diagonal 2-4-6).  \nThus, I must avoid edge squares 1, 3, and 7 to prevent O from forking.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* I (X) have a mark at top-left (0). My goal is to create immediate two-in-a-row threats to pressure O into defensive moves. The top row (0-1-2) and left column (0-3-6) are active lines:  \n- Playing at 2 (top-right) creates a two-in-a-row threat in the top row (0 and 2), forcing O to block at 1 next turn.  \n- Playing at 6 (bottom-left) creates a two-in-a-row threat in the left column (0 and 6), forcing O to block at 3 next turn.  \n- Playing at 5 (middle-right) offers no strong immediate threat, as O controls the center, making middle row development less impactful. Corners 2 and 6 maximize offensive pressure by leveraging corner strength (3 winning lines each).\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* O controls the center (4) and one corner (8), while I control top-left (0). The remaining corners (top-right 2 and bottom-left 6) are symmetrically equivalent and optimal:  \n- Corners participate in 3 winning lines (vs. edges' 2), providing maximum board influence.  \n- Playing at 2 or 6 secures a second corner, balancing the board and limiting O's central dominance.  \n- Edge squares (1, 3, 5, 7) are weaker; 5 is less valuable than corners as it only supports row/column lines without diagonal benefits. Corners align best with counter-controlling O's position.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* After eliminating dangerous edges (1, 3, 7), safe moves are corners 2/6 and edge 5. However, 5 (middle-right) does not force O into a defensive reply\u2014it allows O to build threats freely (e.g., O could target diagonal 2-4-6). Playing at 2 or 6 is superior:  \n- If X plays at 2, O must block the top row at 1, preventing O from creating multiple threats immediately.  \n- Similarly, playing at 6 forces O to block the left column at 3.  \nThis avoids forks while maintaining safety. 5 is riskier as it gives O initiative.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Playing at 2 or 6 generates an instant two-in-a-row that O must address, ceding me tempo:  \n- 2 creates top row pressure (0-2), threatening win at 1.  \n- 6 creates left column pressure (0-6), threatening win at 3.  \n- 5 offers no comparable threat, letting O develop actively (e.g., O could target diagonal 2-4-6). Corners also position X for future forks (e.g., after O blocks, X can threaten multiple lines). 2 is conventionally preferred for consistency with top-side development.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Corners 2 and 6 both reinforce X's control:  \n- 2 completes top-row influence and counters O's corner (8) via diagonal symmetry.  \n- 6 solidifies left-column control and mirrors O's (8) for balanced board presence.  \n- Due to rotational symmetry, 2 and 6 are equally strong, but 2 aligns with opening trends (top-side play). Edge 5 is suboptimal\u2014it only intersects two lines and cedes corner value to O. Securing a second corner maximizes flexibility for mid-game.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**  \nPlaying at **2** (top-right corner) is optimal. It avoids defensive weaknesses (no fork risk), creates an immediate offensive threat forcing O to block, and secures a high-value corner for positional dominance. This move balances safety, initiative, and board control\u2014critical for countering O's central strength.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] ### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has placed marks in 0 and 2, which are corners, and 'O' has marks in the center (4) and corner 8. My primary concern is identifying any immediate threats from 'X'. 'X' has two marks (0 and 2) in the top row. This means if 'X' plays in position 1, they would win. Therefore, my immediate defensive priority is to block position 1.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has established a two-in-a-row in the top row (0 and 2). My goal is to create winning lines for myself and capitalize on my central 'O' (4) and corner 'O' (8) advantage. Playing on 1 will prevent 'X' from winning, but I also need to find a move that sets up my own win or a strong threat.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has occupied two corners (0 and 2), while 'O' holds the center (4) and another corner (8). The board is starting to fill up. My central 'O' is very powerful. I need to continue to influence lines that branch from my central piece. The square 1 is a blocking move, but also a strategic one as it connects with my 'O' in 4 (via the column 1-4-7) and also forms part of the 0-1-2 row.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The most critical defensive move is to block 'X's winning line on the top row. This means placing 'O' in position 1. Failure to do so would result in 'X' winning on their next turn.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* While blocking 'X' at 1 is mandatory, it's also a good offensive move. By placing 'O' at 1, I establish a new two-in-a-row with 'O' in 4 (column 1-4-7). This forces 'X' to react to my threat in the future or allows me to complete this line. It also means my 'O's are now spread across a row (0-1-2, with O at 1), a column (1-4-7, with O at 1 and 4), and a diagonal (0-4-8, with O at 4 and 8), giving me more flexibility.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* Placing 'O' in position 1 is a forced move from a defensive standpoint, but it also has strong positional benefits. It controls the center of the top edge, participating in the top row and the middle column. This further solidifies 'O's central control, extending influence upwards and creating a strong line with 'O' at 4. This move prevents 'X's immediate win and continues to build 'O's strategic control over the board.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**\nPlacing 'O' in position 1 is the critical and optimal move. It immediately blocks 'X's winning line and simultaneously creates a new offensive line for 'O'.\n\n[1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] [7]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]'\n[Player 0] ### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has played at 7. Current board: X at 0, 2, 7. O at 1, 4, 8. I need to check for immediate threats or potential forks from 'X'.\n- X has 0, 2, 7.\n- No direct 2-in-a-row for X that would lead to a win on their next turn.\n- No immediate threat of a fork from X.\nMy primary defensive goal is to ensure O cannot be immediately outmaneuvered, and to respond to X's last move (7).\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* I have 'O' at 1, 4, 8. 'X' is at 0, 2, 7. I need to identify where I can create a two-in-a-row to put pressure on X or set up a future win.\n- I have O at 4 and 8. Taking 6 would create a diagonal 6-4-2 (potential win if X wasn't at 2) and a row 6-7-8 (potential win if X wasn't at 7). Since X is at 7, 6 does next make a 2-in-a-row for myself on the bottom.\n- My O at 1 and 4 makes a two-in-a-row down the middle column. If I play at 7, I would win, but X is already there. So the 1-4-7 column is blocked for me.\n- My O at 4 and 8 forms part of the diagonal 0-4-8. X is at 0, so that line is blocked for me.\n- I need to establish a new 2-in-a-row or build towards a fork. The available cells are 3, 5, 6.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* My 'O's are at 1 (top-center), 4 (center), and 8 (bottom-right corner). 'X's are at 0 (top-left corner), 2 (top-right corner), and 7 (bottom-center). I need to consider which available square (3, 5, 6) offers the best strategic advantage, considering both defensive and offensive implications.\n- Square 3 (middle-left) is on the same row as O at 4, and X at 0.\n- Square 5 (middle-right) is on the same row as O at 4, and X at 2.\n- Square 6 (bottom-left corner) is on the same row as O at 8, and X at 7. It also connects to X at 0.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* 'X' used their last move (7) to block my potential win on the 1-4-7 column. This means X is thinking defensively as well. Now I need to see where 'X' might create a future threat.\n- X has 0, 2, 7.\n- If X takes 3, they threaten 0-3-6. O has 4.\n- If X takes 5, they threaten 2-5-8. O has 4.\n- If X takes 6, they threaten 0-6-3. O has 4, and 8.\nMy current strategy should focus on blocking any future 2-in-a-row for X, and critically, positions that setup a fork for X.\n- If X gets 3 and 6, they don't get a fork as 0 is blocked.\n- If X gets 5 and 6, no direct fork.\n\nLet's re-evaluate X's potential win conditions.\nX currently has two in a row on the top (0,2) but my O at 1 blocks it.\nX has 0, 7. This does not pose an immediate threat.\nX has 2, 7. This does not pose an immediate threat.\nThe most dangerous squares for X to acquire are those that complete a line. No such square exists for X currently.\nMy defensive move should anticipate X's next move and prevent a fork.\nConsider if I place an O in 3. X cannot create a two-in-a-row.\nConsider if I place an O in 5. X cannot create a two-in-a-row.\nConsider if I place an O in 6. X cannot create a two-in-a-row.\n\nMy goal is to stop X from making a two-in-a-row AND from creating a fork.\nIf I play at 3, I get a two-in-a-row with 4 (3,4,5). After I play 3, the board is:\nX O X\nO O 5\n6 X O\nIf X then plays 5, they get 2-5-8. I would have to block at 6.\nBut if I play 5 instead.\nX O X\n3 O O\n6 X O\nThen X can play at 3 and get line 0-3-6. I block at 6.\nIf I play at 6.\nX O X\n3 O 5\nO X O\nThen X can play at 3 forming 0-3-6 or 5 forming 2-5-8. This looks like a better option.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* My 'O's are at 1, 4, 8. I am looking for a move (3, 5, or 6) that creates an immediate win threat or a strong potential fork.\n- If I play 3: I create O-O at 3,4. This threatens a win at 5. (3-4-5) X would have to block at 5.\n- If I play 5: I create O-O at 4,5. This threatens a win at 3. (3-4-5) X would have to block at 3.\n- If I play 6: I create O-O at 6,8 (with X at 7, the row is blocked). I also create O-X-O at 0-X-6, so this doesn't help me yet. But I create a diagonal 6-4-2. X is at 2, so this blocks X's diagonal now.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the offensive potential of 3, 5, and 6:\n- **Playing at 3:** Creates a two-in-a-row with my 'O' at 4 (line 3-4-5). This forces 'X' to block at 5 on their next move. This is a strong offensive move as it forces a reaction from X.\n- **Playing at 5:** Creates a two-in-a-row with my 'O' at 4 (line 3-4-5). This forces 'X' to block at 3 on their next move. This is equally strong as playing at 3 due to symmetry.\n- **Playing at 6:** This creates an 'O' in a corner. It also forms a two-in-a-row for me with 8 (6-7-8) but X is at 7 so this row is useless. It does connect to my 'O' at 4-6 on the diagonal 2-4-6. X is at 2, so this blocks X from winning that diagonal. But it doesn't create an immediate 2-in-a-row for myself on the next move that X has to block.\n\nTherefore, 3 or 5 are the strongest offensive moves as they immediately threaten a win.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* I want to maintain control and leverage my existing 'O's at 1, 4, 8.\n- **Playing at 3:** Creates a strong horizontal line with 4 and 5. It establishes O at an advantageous position relative to X at 0. It also helps control the left side of the board.\n- **Playing at 5:** Symmetrical to 3. Creates a strong horizontal line with 3 and 4. Establishes O at an advantageous position relative to X at 2. Helps control the right side of the board.\n- **Playing at 6:** This is a corner. It supports the diagonal 2-4-6, connecting to X at 2 and my O at 4. This is a good defensive move to block X on that diagonal, but it doesn't immediately extend my O's influence into a new line of threat as strongly as 3 or 5. Acquiring a second corner (after 8) balances my board control.\n\nBoth 3 and 5 are strong as they leverage the central 'O' (4) to create immediate threats on the 3-4-5 row, while also securing an edge position. 6 is also good as a corner position, but it doesn't immediately create a 2-in-a-row threat for O. Given that 3 and 5 are symmetrically equal and create an immediate threat, they are positionally stronger for creating an active threat. I will lean towards 3 for left-side board control.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**\nThe primary goal is to create a two-in-a-row for 'O' that 'X' must block. Both 3 and 5 achieve this by forming a line with the central 'O' at 4. Due to symmetry, both are equally strong. Let's choose 3 since it is the lowest available numeric option.\n\n[3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]'",

Since the board is empty, there are no immediate threats yet.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* My goal is to create multiple winning lines for 'O'. On an empty board, I should consider moves that open up the most potential winning opportunities.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* I'm looking for moves that grant control over key areas of the board, especially those that participate in multiple winning lines. The center square is usually the most powerful initial move.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* With no threats, my defensive strategy is to still play a solid opening move that doesn't inadvertently leave easy openings for 'X'. A central or corner position is generally safe.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The center square (4) participates in four out of the eight possible winning lines, more than any other square. This makes it the strongest offensive opening.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The center square (4) connects all rows, columns, and diagonals, making it the most strategically important square for board control. It allows 'O' to influence the greatest number of potential winning lines.\n\n4]\n[GAME] Player 0 attempted an invalid move. Reason: The submitted move does not follow the correct format.

I must now prevent 'O' from building multiple threats around the center. As Player 1 (X), I should avoid edges and aim for a corner, as corners are harder to exploit against and offer better counter-control.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* Since O controls the center, I need to establish a strong presence that allows multiple paths to victory. Corners are best for this because they each contribute to three potential lines. I'll prioritize a corner to maximize future offensive setups.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* The center is taken by O, so the next best positions are the corners. Each corner (0, 2, 6, 8) intersects three winning lines and counters central control effectively. Taking a corner gives X balanced influence and limits O\u2019s dominance.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* If I don\u2019t take a corner, O can potentially fork me later by threatening two lines at once. Corners are safest \u2014 especially opposite corners \u2014 so I should take one now to deny such setups.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Taking a corner allows me to build two potential lines (one row, one column, and possibly a diagonal). The diagonal from corner to corner through center is powerful. Since O has center, playing in a corner gives me a foothold on one diagonal.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Corner squares are superior when center is occupied by the opponent. Of all corners, it doesn\u2019t matter which one I pick initially due to symmetry. I\u2019ll pick top-left (0) as it\u2019s conventionally optimal and maximizes flexibility.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**  \nPlaying in a corner, specifically position 0, is the best response to O taking the center.\n\n[0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 1:* My primary focus is to prevent 'X' from creating a winning line or a fork (two winning threats). 'X' has taken corner 0 and 'O' has center 4. This creates a diagonal line (0-4-8) that 'X' could complete. My next move should block this immediate threat.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has played in a corner. My goal as 'O' is to create my own winning opportunities. The center position I occupy is crucial for this. I need to extend my influence from the center to set up multiple potential lines.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has taken a corner, which is a strong positional play against a central 'O'. My task is to maintain control and leverage my central position. I should consider squares that interact with 'X's corner and my center, providing crucial board control.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The most immediate and dangerous threat 'X' can pose is by taking the opposite corner (8) to complete a diagonal with their current position (0) and my center (4). Therefore, I must immediately block cell 8.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* By playing in corner 8, I not only create a potentially winning diagonal (0-4-8) for myself if 'X' had not taken 0, but by playing there now, I create two new active lines for 'O' (row 6-7-8 and column 2-5-8) that pass through a corner. This also sets up a potential fork if X doesn't block properly. This is the optimal offensive move given 'X's play.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* Taking the opposite corner (8) creates a powerful symmetric setup with my central 'O' and 'X's corner 'X' (0). This move reinforces my central control, covers a major diagonal, and sets up multiple future winning possibilities by creating symmetrical threats. It also immediately blocks a potential winning line for 'X'.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**\nPlacing 'O' in position 8 is the strongest move, as it blocks 'X's potential diagonal win while simultaneously creating offensive potential and reinforcing 'O's central dominance.]\n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] ### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* Player 0 (O) has occupied the center (4) and bottom-right corner (8). As Player 1 (X), I must prioritize blocking potential forks where O could threaten two winning lines simultaneously. Currently, O does not have an immediate two-in-a-row, but certain moves by X (e.g., playing on edge squares like 1, 3, or 7) would allow O to create a fork next turn. For example:  \n- If X plays at 1 (top-center), O can respond at 2, creating threats at 5 and 6 (column 2 and diagonal 2-4-6).  \n- If X plays at 3 (left-center), O can respond at 6, creating threats at 2 and 7 (diagonal 2-4-6 and bottom row).  \n- If X plays at 7 (bottom-center), O can respond at 2, creating threats at 5 and 6 (column 2 and diagonal 2-4-6).  \nThus, I must avoid edge squares 1, 3, and 7 to prevent O from forking.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* I (X) have a mark at top-left (0). My goal is to create immediate two-in-a-row threats to pressure O into defensive moves. The top row (0-1-2) and left column (0-3-6) are active lines:  \n- Playing at 2 (top-right) creates a two-in-a-row threat in the top row (0 and 2), forcing O to block at 1 next turn.  \n- Playing at 6 (bottom-left) creates a two-in-a-row threat in the left column (0 and 6), forcing O to block at 3 next turn.  \n- Playing at 5 (middle-right) offers no strong immediate threat, as O controls the center, making middle row development less impactful. Corners 2 and 6 maximize offensive pressure by leveraging corner strength (3 winning lines each).\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 1:* O controls the center (4) and one corner (8), while I control top-left (0). The remaining corners (top-right 2 and bottom-left 6) are symmetrically equivalent and optimal:  \n- Corners participate in 3 winning lines (vs. edges' 2), providing maximum board influence.  \n- Playing at 2 or 6 secures a second corner, balancing the board and limiting O's central dominance.  \n- Edge squares (1, 3, 5, 7) are weaker; 5 is less valuable than corners as it only supports row/column lines without diagonal benefits. Corners align best with counter-controlling O's position.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* After eliminating dangerous edges (1, 3, 7), safe moves are corners 2/6 and edge 5. However, 5 (middle-right) does not force O into a defensive reply\u2014it allows O to build threats freely (e.g., O could target diagonal 2-4-6). Playing at 2 or 6 is superior:  \n- If X plays at 2, O must block the top row at 1, preventing O from creating multiple threats immediately.  \n- Similarly, playing at 6 forces O to block the left column at 3.  \nThis avoids forks while maintaining safety. 5 is riskier as it gives O initiative.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Playing at 2 or 6 generates an instant two-in-a-row that O must address, ceding me tempo:  \n- 2 creates top row pressure (0-2), threatening win at 1.  \n- 6 creates left column pressure (0-6), threatening win at 3.  \n- 5 offers no comparable threat, letting O develop actively (e.g., O could target diagonal 2-4-6). Corners also position X for future forks (e.g., after O blocks, X can threaten multiple lines). 2 is conventionally preferred for consistency with top-side development.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**  \n*Thinking Step 2:* Corners 2 and 6 both reinforce X's control:  \n- 2 completes top-row influence and counters O's corner (8) via diagonal symmetry.  \n- 6 solidifies left-column control and mirrors O's (8) for balanced board presence.  \n- Due to rotational symmetry, 2 and 6 are equally strong, but 2 aligns with opening trends (top-side play). Edge 5 is suboptimal\u2014it only intersects two lines and cedes corner value to O. Securing a second corner maximizes flexibility for mid-game.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**  \nPlaying at **2** (top-right corner) is optimal. It avoids defensive weaknesses (no fork risk), creates an immediate offensive threat forcing O to block, and secures a high-value corner for positional dominance. This move balances safety, initiative, and board control\u2014critical for countering O's central strength.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] ### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has placed marks in 0 and 2, which are corners, and 'O' has marks in the center (4) and corner 8. My primary concern is identifying any immediate threats from 'X'. 'X' has two marks (0 and 2) in the top row. This means if 'X' plays in position 1, they would win. Therefore, my immediate defensive priority is to block position 1.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has established a two-in-a-row in the top row (0 and 2). My goal is to create winning lines for myself and capitalize on my central 'O' (4) and corner 'O' (8) advantage. Playing on 1 will prevent 'X' from winning, but I also need to find a move that sets up my own win or a strong threat.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has occupied two corners (0 and 2), while 'O' holds the center (4) and another corner (8). The board is starting to fill up. My central 'O' is very powerful. I need to continue to influence lines that branch from my central piece. The square 1 is a blocking move, but also a strategic one as it connects with my 'O' in 4 (via the column 1-4-7) and also forms part of the 0-1-2 row.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The most critical defensive move is to block 'X's winning line on the top row. This means placing 'O' in position 1. Failure to do so would result in 'X' winning on their next turn.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* While blocking 'X' at 1 is mandatory, it's also a good offensive move. By placing 'O' at 1, I establish a new two-in-a-row with 'O' in 4 (column 1-4-7). This forces 'X' to react to my threat in the future or allows me to complete this line. It also means my 'O's are now spread across a row (0-1-2, with O at 1), a column (1-4-7, with O at 1 and 4), and a diagonal (0-4-8, with O at 4 and 8), giving me more flexibility.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* Placing 'O' in position 1 is a forced move from a defensive standpoint, but it also has strong positional benefits. It controls the center of the top edge, participating in the top row and the middle column. This further solidifies 'O's central control, extending influence upwards and creating a strong line with 'O' at 4. This move prevents 'X's immediate win and continues to build 'O's strategic control over the board.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**\nPlacing 'O' in position 1 is the critical and optimal move. It immediately blocks 'X's winning line and simultaneously creates a new offensive line for 'O'.\n\n[1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] [7]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]'\n[Player 0] ### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has played at 7. Current board: X at 0, 2, 7. O at 1, 4, 8. I need to check for immediate threats or potential forks from 'X'.\n- X has 0, 2, 7.\n- No direct 2-in-a-row for X that would lead to a win on their next turn.\n- No immediate threat of a fork from X.\nMy primary defensive goal is to ensure O cannot be immediately outmaneuvered, and to respond to X's last move (7).\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* I have 'O' at 1, 4, 8. 'X' is at 0, 2, 7. I need to identify where I can create a two-in-a-row to put pressure on X or set up a future win.\n- I have O at 4 and 8. Taking 6 would create a diagonal 6-4-2 (potential win if X wasn't at 2) and a row 6-7-8 (potential win if X wasn't at 7). Since X is at 7, 6 does next make a 2-in-a-row for myself on the bottom.\n- My O at 1 and 4 makes a two-in-a-row down the middle column. If I play at 7, I would win, but X is already there. So the 1-4-7 column is blocked for me.\n- My O at 4 and 8 forms part of the diagonal 0-4-8. X is at 0, so that line is blocked for me.\n- I need to establish a new 2-in-a-row or build towards a fork. The available cells are 3, 5, 6.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* My 'O's are at 1 (top-center), 4 (center), and 8 (bottom-right corner). 'X's are at 0 (top-left corner), 2 (top-right corner), and 7 (bottom-center). I need to consider which available square (3, 5, 6) offers the best strategic advantage, considering both defensive and offensive implications.\n- Square 3 (middle-left) is on the same row as O at 4, and X at 0.\n- Square 5 (middle-right) is on the same row as O at 4, and X at 2.\n- Square 6 (bottom-left corner) is on the same row as O at 8, and X at 7. It also connects to X at 0.\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* 'X' used their last move (7) to block my potential win on the 1-4-7 column. This means X is thinking defensively as well. Now I need to see where 'X' might create a future threat.\n- X has 0, 2, 7.\n- If X takes 3, they threaten 0-3-6. O has 4.\n- If X takes 5, they threaten 2-5-8. O has 4.\n- If X takes 6, they threaten 0-6-3. O has 4, and 8.\nMy current strategy should focus on blocking any future 2-in-a-row for X, and critically, positions that setup a fork for X.\n- If X gets 3 and 6, they don't get a fork as 0 is blocked.\n- If X gets 5 and 6, no direct fork.\n\nLet's re-evaluate X's potential win conditions.\nX currently has two in a row on the top (0,2) but my O at 1 blocks it.\nX has 0, 7. This does not pose an immediate threat.\nX has 2, 7. This does not pose an immediate threat.\nThe most dangerous squares for X to acquire are those that complete a line. No such square exists for X currently.\nMy defensive move should anticipate X's next move and prevent a fork.\nConsider if I place an O in 3. X cannot create a two-in-a-row.\nConsider if I place an O in 5. X cannot create a two-in-a-row.\nConsider if I place an O in 6. X cannot create a two-in-a-row.\n\nMy goal is to stop X from making a two-in-a-row AND from creating a fork.\nIf I play at 3, I get a two-in-a-row with 4 (3,4,5). After I play 3, the board is:\nX O X\nO O 5\n6 X O\nIf X then plays 5, they get 2-5-8. I would have to block at 6.\nBut if I play 5 instead.\nX O X\n3 O O\n6 X O\nThen X can play at 3 and get line 0-3-6. I block at 6.\nIf I play at 6.\nX O X\n3 O 5\nO X O\nThen X can play at 3 forming 0-3-6 or 5 forming 2-5-8. This looks like a better option.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* My 'O's are at 1, 4, 8. I am looking for a move (3, 5, or 6) that creates an immediate win threat or a strong potential fork.\n- If I play 3: I create O-O at 3,4. This threatens a win at 5. (3-4-5) X would have to block at 5.\n- If I play 5: I create O-O at 4,5. This threatens a win at 3. (3-4-5) X would have to block at 3.\n- If I play 6: I create O-O at 6,8 (with X at 7, the row is blocked). I also create O-X-O at 0-X-6, so this doesn't help me yet. But I create a diagonal 6-4-2. X is at 2, so this blocks X's diagonal now.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the offensive potential of 3, 5, and 6:\n- **Playing at 3:** Creates a two-in-a-row with my 'O' at 4 (line 3-4-5). This forces 'X' to block at 5 on their next move. This is a strong offensive move as it forces a reaction from X.\n- **Playing at 5:** Creates a two-in-a-row with my 'O' at 4 (line 3-4-5). This forces 'X' to block at 3 on their next move. This is equally strong as playing at 3 due to symmetry.\n- **Playing at 6:** This creates an 'O' in a corner. It also forms a two-in-a-row for me with 8 (6-7-8) but X is at 7 so this row is useless. It does connect to my 'O' at 4-6 on the diagonal 2-4-6. X is at 2, so this blocks X from winning that diagonal. But it doesn't create an immediate 2-in-a-row for myself on the next move that X has to block.\n\nTherefore, 3 or 5 are the strongest offensive moves as they immediately threaten a win.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* I want to maintain control and leverage my existing 'O's at 1, 4, 8.\n- **Playing at 3:** Creates a strong horizontal line with 4 and 5. It establishes O at an advantageous position relative to X at 0. It also helps control the left side of the board.\n- **Playing at 5:** Symmetrical to 3. Creates a strong horizontal line with 3 and 4. Establishes O at an advantageous position relative to X at 2. Helps control the right side of the board.\n- **Playing at 6:** This is a corner. It supports the diagonal 2-4-6, connecting to X at 2 and my O at 4. This is a good defensive move to block X on that diagonal, but it doesn't immediately extend my O's influence into a new line of threat as strongly as 3 or 5. Acquiring a second corner (after 8) balances my board control.\n\nBoth 3 and 5 are strong as they leverage the central 'O' (4) to create immediate threats on the 3-4-5 row, while also securing an edge position. 6 is also good as a corner position, but it doesn't immediately create a 2-in-a-row threat for O. Given that 3 and 5 are symmetrically equal and create an immediate threat, they are positionally stronger for creating an active threat. I will lean towards 3 for left-side board control.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**\nThe primary goal is to create a two-in-a-row for 'O' that 'X' must block. Both 3 and 5 achieve this by forming a line with the central 'O' at 4. Due to symmetry, both are equally strong. Let's choose 3 since it is the lowest available numeric option.\n\n[3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]'\n[Player 1] [5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[6]'",
      "response": "### Expert Advisers:\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 1:* 'X' has played at 5. Current board: X at 0, 2, 5, 7. O at 1, 3, 4, 8. I need to check for immediate threats or potential forks from 'X'.\n- X has 0, 2, 5, 7.\n- Check rows:\n    - Top (0,1,2): X O X - blocked\n    - Middle (3,4,5): O O X - blocked\n    - Bottom (6,7,8): _ X O - No 2-in-a-row for X.\n- Check columns:\n    - Left (0,3,6): X O _ - No 2-in-a-row for X.\n    - Middle (1,4,7): O O X - Blocked.\n    - Right (2,5,8): X X O - This is a potential threat from X! X has 2 and 5, so if they could play at 8, they would win. But O is at 8, so this is blocked.\n- Check diagonals:\n    - (0,4,8): X O O - Blocked.\n    - (2,4,6): X O _ - No 2-in-a-row for X.\n- No immediate threat of a win for X. No immediate threat of a fork for X.\nMy primary defensive goal is to ensure O is not outmaneuvered and maintain any potential winning lines.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 1:* I have 'O' at 1, 3, 4, 8. 'X' is at 0, 2, 5, 7. I need to identify where I can create a win or a strong two-in-a-row to put pressure on X.\n- My 'O's are at 1, 3, 4, 8.\n- Check for existing two-in-a-rows for O and potential wins:\n    - Row 3-4-5: O O X (blocked by X at 5)\n    - Column 1-4-7: O O X (blocked by X at 7)\n    - Diagonal 0-4-8: X O O (blocked by X at 0)\n    - Diagonal 2-4-6: X O _ (If I play at 6, I win!)\nYes, playing at 6 completes the diagonal 2-4-6. 'X' is at 2, I am at 4, and if I play at 6, that line is 'X-O-O'. Wait, this is wrong. The diagonal is 2-4-6. My 'O' is at 4. 'X' is at 2. If I play at 6, it becomes 'X' (at 2) - 'O' (at 4) - 'O' (at 6). This is not my win. This is wrong.\n\nLet's re-evaluate my win conditions. I have O at 1, 3, 4, 8.\n- Top row (0,1,2): X O X - Blocked.\n- Middle row (3,4,5): O O X - Blocked.\n- Bottom row (6,7,8): _ X O - If I play at 6, it becomes O X O. This does not win.\n- Left column (0,3,6): X O _ - If I play at 6, it becomes X O O. This wins!\nYes, playing at 6 for 'O' completes the 0-3-6 column (X-O-O). This is a win.\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 1:* My 'O's are at 1 (top-center), 3 (middle-left), 4 (center), and 8 (bottom-right corner). 'X's are at 0 (top-left corner), 2 (top-right corner), 5 (middle-right), and 7 (bottom-center). The only available move is 6 (bottom-left corner). I need to determine if this move is safe (defensively) and beneficial (offensively/positionally).\n\n**Expert 1: Defensive Strategist**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The only remaining move for 'O' is 6. I must check if playing at 6 creates any self-defeating scenarios or leaves 'X' with a winning move after this.\n- If O plays at 6:\n    - Column 0-3-6 becomes X-O-O. This is a win for O!\nSince winning is the goal, this is the best defensive move. It ensures 'X' cannot win, because 'O' wins first.\n\n**Expert 2: Offensive Tactician**\n*Thinking Step 2:* My analysis confirms playing at 6 creates a winning line for 'O' along the left column (0-3-6). 'O' is at 3, 'X' is at 0. If 'O' plays at 6, the line becomes 'X-O-O'. This is a clear win for Player 0 (O).\n\n**Expert 3: Positional Expert**\n*Thinking Step 2:* The only available square is 6.\n- This square completes the column 0-3-6. 'X' is at 0, 'O' is at 3. Playing 'O' at 6 would make the column X-O-O. This is a win for 'O'.\n- It also completes the diagonal 2-4-6. 'X' is at 2, 'O' is at 4. Playing 'O' at 6 would make the diagonal X-O-O. This is also a win for 'O'!\nThis move not only secures the last remaining corner but also results in two winning lines. This is the optimal move.\n\n**All Experts Concur:**\nPlacing 'O' in position 6 wins the game for Player 0 along the left column (0-3-6) and the diagonal (2-4-6).\n\n[6]",
