      "response": "[Player 0] [Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Identify any immediate threats from Player X (X). X occupies position 0 (top-left corner), and O controls the center (4). X does not have two in a row yet, so no immediate win threat exists. However, if X gets both 0 and 2 (top row), or 0 and 6 (left column), or 0 and 8 (diagonal), it could become dangerous. Need to monitor these.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line. O is in the center (4), which is strong. To build toward a win, O should aim for positions that complement the center \u2014 especially corners opposite to X or positions that create two-in-a-row setups. Possible forks can be created by playing in corner 8 (bottom-right), which gives a diagonal with 0\u20134\u20138 and shares row/column with 6 and 2.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control. X has taken corner 0. O has center 4. The remaining key positions are corners 2, 6, 8 and edges. Corner 8 is the most valuable remaining corner \u2014 it opposes X\u2019s corner and forms the opposite diagonal (0\u20134\u20138), which O can now claim. Taking 8 would balance positional strength.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Consider how X could form a fork or multiple threats. If X gets both 2 and 6, combined with 0, they could threaten top row and left column. But more immediately, if X plays 2 next, they threaten top row (0\u20131\u20132). But O in center can block easily. However, O should not allow X to dominate corners. Playing in 8 prevents X from easily taking it later and reduces X\u2019s options.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that move 8 sets up multiple threats. If O takes 8, then O has 4 and 8 \u2014 control of the anti-diagonal. Then future moves to 6 or 2 could set up a fork (e.g., 6 and 2 would give row and column threats). Also, if O has 4 and 8, and later gets 2, that\u2019s a row; if gets 6, that\u2019s a column. Very flexible.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that corner symmetry matters. X has 0; O should take 8 to claim the opposite corner. This is a well-known principle in Tic Tac Toe strategy: when opponent takes a corner, responding with the opposite corner in the next move (especially from center) is optimal. It neutralizes X\u2019s corner influence and maximizes O\u2019s control.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 no immediate threat, but move 8 prevents X from gaining positional dominance and blocks potential diagonal setups. Defensive goals are served.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 move 8 enables O to build toward a fork via 2 or 6 later. Strongest offensive move.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 8 is the optimal response to X taking 0 while O holds center.

X has taken corner 0. O has center 4. The remaining key positions are corners 2, 6, 8 and edges. Corner 8 is the most valuable remaining corner \u2014 it opposes X\u2019s corner and forms the opposite diagonal (0\u20134\u20138), which O can now claim. Taking 8 would balance positional strength.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Consider how X could form a fork or multiple threats. If X gets both 2 and 6, combined with 0, they could threaten top row and left column. But more immediately, if X plays 2 next, they threaten top row (0\u20131\u20132). But O in center can block easily. However, O should not allow X to dominate corners. Playing in 8 prevents X from easily taking it later and reduces X\u2019s options.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that move 8 sets up multiple threats. If O takes 8, then O has 4 and 8 \u2014 control of the anti-diagonal. Then future moves to 6 or 2 could set up a fork (e.g., 6 and 2 would give row and column threats). Also, if O has 4 and 8, and later gets 2, that\u2019s a row; if gets 6, that\u2019s a column. Very flexible.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that corner symmetry matters. X has 0; O should take 8 to claim the opposite corner. This is a well-known principle in Tic Tac Toe strategy: when opponent takes a corner, responding with the opposite corner in the next move (especially from center) is optimal. It neutralizes X\u2019s corner influence and maximizes O\u2019s control.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 no immediate threat, but move 8 prevents X from gaining positional dominance and blocks potential diagonal setups.

The center (position 4) is optimal for creating multiple lines (middle row, middle column, both diagonals).\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control and influence. The center square (4) controls four potential lines: row 1, column 1, and both diagonals. It is the most valuable square in terms of future influence.

While there are currently no immediate threats, we must be cautious to prevent O from gaining control.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to establish a strong offensive position. Given O is in the center, I need to prioritize creating my own opportunities while ensuring O doesn't easily form a winning line. It\u2019s crucial to create two-in-a-row scenarios.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate current board control. O in position 4 is the strongest position, and thus it's imperative to counter that. I need to place myself in a way that either prepares for the next moves or counters O's position effectively.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Identify positions that would allow O to win in their next move. If I don\u2019t prevent O from forming a line, they can easily create two threats by taking either position 1 or 3 next to their center. Thus, placing in positions adjacent to the center is crucial.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Assess opportunities to build my sequences. I can either play in one of the corners and aim for forks later or block O\u2019s possible winning moves. The corners (0, 2, 6, 8) would be good offensive positions while staying defensive.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Reassess control of the board with O in the center.

      "response": "[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Analyze immediate threats from Player X (X). X occupies positions 0 and 6 (left column), which forms a partial vertical line. However, O already controls center (4), so X cannot win with left column unless they get both 3 and another move \u2014 but 3 is still available. No immediate two-in-a-row for X. Check O's own winning chances: O has 4 and 8. If O gets 2, that completes the diagonal (2\u20134\u20136? No \u2014 2, 4, 6 is not diagonal). Wait: O has 4 and 8. Diagonal win requires 0\u20134\u20138, but 0 is taken by X. The other diagonal is 2\u20134\u20136, but 6 is X. So no immediate win for O. Wait \u2014 correction: O\u2019s diagonal is 6\u20134\u20132? 6 is X. 8\u20134\u20130? 0 is X. So O's current marks (4 and 8) do not form an active two-in-a-row threat. But O could aim for bottom row: 6-X, 7-?, 8-O. So only if O gets 7, they get two in a row but not a win. Top row: 0-X, 1-?, 2-? \u2014 possible. Let's reassess.\n\nWait \u2014 correct diagonal: cells 0\u20134\u20138 is one diagonal. X has 0, O has 4 and 8 \u2192 this diagonal is blocked because X has 0. Other diagonal: 2\u20134\u20136: 2 is open, 4 is O, 6 is X \u2192 blocked. So O has no immediate win threat.\n\nNow check X\u2019s threats: X has 0 and 6 (both left column). If X plays 3, they get column 0 (vertical), which is 0\u20133\u20136? No: vertical column 0 is positions 0, 3, 6 \u2014 yes! That\u2019s the left column. X has 0 and 6. If X gets 3, they win vertically. So 3 is a winning threat for X.\n\nTherefore, **O must block X from playing 3** \u2014 because if it's X\u2019s turn next, and we don\u2019t block, X will win. But it\u2019s currently **Player 0 (O)\u2019s turn**, and O is to move now.\n\nSo O can **prevent X\u2019s win** by taking **position 3** first.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line. O has center (4) and corner (8). Current positions do not allow a two-move win. Possible lines:\n\n- Diagonals: 0\u20134\u20138 \u2192 blocked by X at 0.\n- 2\u20134\u20136 \u2192 blocked by X at 6.\n- Rows:\n  - Bottom row: 6 (X), 7 (?), 8 (O) \u2192 O can only get two if 7 is taken.\n  - Middle row: 3 (?), 4 (O), 5 (?) \u2192 possible two-in-a-row if O takes 3 or 5.\n  - Top row: 0 (X), 1 (?), 2 (?) \u2192 possible horizontal threat if O gets 1 and 2.\n\nBut **no immediate win possibility** for O in one move.\n\nHowever, **X threatens to win by playing 3** (to complete left column: 0\u20133\u20136). Since it\u2019s O\u2019s turn now, O can **preemptively take 3** to block X\u2019s win.\n\nSo the **priority is defensive**, but the move serves positional control too.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control. Key remaining squares: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- Edges: 1 (top edge), 3 (left edge), 5 (right edge), 7 (bottom edge)\n- Corners: 2 is the last remaining corner.\n\nCorners are valuable, but **position 3 is critical now because it blocks X\u2019s immediate winning threat** (column 0: 0\u20133\u20136).\n\nWhile corner 2 is strong (gives O a top-right corner and potential for top row or right column), **safety comes first**: losing on next turn is worse than missing an opportunity.\n\nSo **position 3 must be taken** to maintain game continuity.\n\nTaking 3 also gives O presence in the middle-left, supports control of middle row, and may help form a horizontal threat later.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that X\u2019s threat of playing 3 to win is real and immediate. Since it's O\u2019s turn, the correct response is to **play 3 now** to block that threat. No other move is acceptable \u2014 any other choice allows X to play 3 next and win.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Consider if there is a move that both blocks and creates a threat. Playing 3 only creates a partial middle row (3\u20134\u20135), but doesn\u2019t create an immediate two-in-a-row win threat. However, **no fork or immediate win is possible**, so best is to play safe. Alternative: play 2? Then O would have 2 and 8, both in row 0 and column 2? 2 and 8 are both in right column (2, 5, 8)? 2 is top-right, 5 middle-right, 8 bottom-right \u2192 yes, right column.\n\nIf O plays 2, then O has 2 and 8 \u2014 that\u2019s two in the right column. Then if O later gets 5, they win vertically.\n\nBut if O plays 2, then X plays 3 \u2192 X wins left column (0\u20133\u20136). So **O cannot play 2** \u2014 it allows X to win immediately.\n\nSimilarly, playing 1, 5, or 7 also allows X to play 3 and win.\n\nOnly **playing 3 prevents X\u2019s win**.\n\nThus, **3 is the only safe move**.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: While corner 2 is the last valuable corner, **board control is meaningless if you lose next turn**. Temporal priority outweighs positional hierarchy. Taking 3 now preserves balance. Furthermore, 3 is an edge, but in this case, it's a **critical intersection** \u2014 part of left column and middle row.\n\nBy taking 3, O contests middle row and denies X a key node.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 **only move 3 prevents X from winning on their next turn**. All other moves lose instantly. This is mandatory.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: No offensive opportunity justifies allowing a loss. Move 3 is forced. Later, O can aim for right column (2 and 5) or middle row (with 5) to create threats.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Though not ideal to spend a move on an edge early, this is a **forced response** due to X\u2019s threat. Positional principles adapt to tactical reality. Move 3 is correct.\n\n[Consensus reached: All three experts agree on move 3]\n\n[3]",

Player O has taken the center (4), which gives them power to create future threats. While there are currently no immediate threats, we must be cautious to prevent O from gaining control.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to establish a strong offensive position. Given O is in the center, I need to prioritize creating my own opportunities while ensuring O doesn't easily form a winning line. It\u2019s crucial to create two-in-a-row scenarios.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate current board control. O in position 4 is the strongest position, and thus it's imperative to counter that. I need to place myself in a way that either prepares for the next moves or counters O's position effectively.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Identify positions that would allow O to win in their next move. If I don\u2019t prevent O from forming a line, they can easily create two threats by taking either position 1 or 3 next to their center. Thus, placing in positions adjacent to the center is crucial.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Assess opportunities to build my sequences. I can either play in one of the corners and aim for forks later or block O\u2019s possible winning moves. The corners (0, 2, 6, 8) would be good offensive positions while staying defensive.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Reassess control of the board with O in the center. The next moves should be definitively strategic. Playing in a corner (e.g. position 0) is likely to yield future control while also defending against O's upcoming threats.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Conclude that immediate attention should be given to the corners, particularly position 0 or 2, which can serve both defensive and offensive purposes. I will recommend my move as 0.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Center dominance is crucial, so taking corners or working toward the middle row is a priority. I will also suggest position 0 as it creates a potential winning line.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Evaluate corners as good options that maintain control without ceding power to O. Position 0 offers solid board control and the potential to fork in subsequent moves.

X occupies position 0 (top-left corner), and O controls the center (4). X does not have two in a row yet, so no immediate win threat exists. However, if X gets both 0 and 2 (top row), or 0 and 6 (left column), or 0 and 8 (diagonal), it could become dangerous. Need to monitor these.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line. O is in the center (4), which is strong. To build toward a win, O should aim for positions that complement the center \u2014 especially corners opposite to X or positions that create two-in-a-row setups. Possible forks can be created by playing in corner 8 (bottom-right), which gives a diagonal with 0\u20134\u20138 and shares row/column with 6 and 2.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control. X has taken corner 0. O has center 4. The remaining key positions are corners 2, 6, 8 and edges. Corner 8 is the most valuable remaining corner \u2014 it opposes X\u2019s corner and forms the opposite diagonal (0\u20134\u20138), which O can now claim. Taking 8 would balance positional strength.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Consider how X could form a fork or multiple threats. If X gets both 2 and 6, combined with 0, they could threaten top row and left column. But more immediately, if X plays 2 next, they threaten top row (0\u20131\u20132). But O in center can block easily. However, O should not allow X to dominate corners. Playing in 8 prevents X from easily taking it later and reduces X\u2019s options.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that move 8 sets up multiple threats. If O takes 8, then O has 4 and 8 \u2014 control of the anti-diagonal. Then future moves to 6 or 2 could set up a fork (e.g., 6 and 2 would give row and column threats). Also, if O has 4 and 8, and later gets 2, that\u2019s a row; if gets 6, that\u2019s a column. Very flexible.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that corner symmetry matters. X has 0; O should take 8 to claim the opposite corner. This is a well-known principle in Tic Tac Toe strategy: when opponent takes a corner, responding with the opposite corner in the next move (especially from center) is optimal. It neutralizes X\u2019s corner influence and maximizes O\u2019s control.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 no immediate threat, but move 8 prevents X from gaining positional dominance and blocks potential diagonal setups. Defensive goals are served.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 move 8 enables O to build toward a fork via 2 or 6 later. Strongest offensive move.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 8 is the optimal response to X taking 0 while O holds center.

O has now placed in cell 8, creating the potential for a win if they get either position 6 next (forming column win) or position 2 (forming a diagonal win). Preventing these two threats is crucial.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Examine chances to set up a winning opportunity. With O positioned in cells 4 and 8, X needs to create a two-in-a-row scenario. Hence, while blocking O, I also need to look for positions that will help me set up my own threat.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Assess the current board positions. X occupies corner 0 and must now control the game. Notably, O has both a corner and the center, which are significant advantages. X should aim for one of the remaining corner cells to create a fork risk.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Identify immediate threats. O can win by playing 6 on their next turn, filling the leftmost column. Therefore, this must be blocked. Position 6 is crucial for my defensive move.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that blocking O's position 6 is essential. By doing this, I also retain the potential to create my own winning row or column alignment. Position 6 is a necessary move.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Evaluate the necessity of blocking O. No matter the future board states, position 6 must be occupied to prevent O from winning. It's not just about blocking but seizing control back from O. \n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Conclude that the best move is definitely position 6. Blocking O from winning is the top priority, ensuring that I retain control.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Final assessment supports my earlier suggestion to occupy 6. While blocking O, it also helps pave the way for potential opportunities later.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Final assessment confirms that 6 is the optimal move to defend against imminent threats while allowing for future control.\n\n[Consensus reached: All three experts agree on move 6]\n\n[6]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Analyze immediate threats from Player X (X). X occupies positions 0 and 6 (left column), which forms a partial vertical line. However, O already controls center (4), so X cannot win with left column unless they get both 3 and another move \u2014 but 3 is still available. No immediate two-in-a-row for X. Check O's own winning chances: O has 4 and 8. If O gets 2, that completes the diagonal (2\u20134\u20136? No \u2014 2, 4, 6 is not diagonal). Wait: O has 4 and 8. Diagonal win requires 0\u20134\u20138, but 0 is taken by X. The other diagonal is 2\u20134\u20136, but 6 is X. So no immediate win for O. Wait \u2014 correction: O\u2019s diagonal is 6\u20134\u20132? 6 is X. 8\u20134\u20130? 0 is X. So O's current marks (4 and 8) do not form an active two-in-a-row threat. But O could aim for bottom row: 6-X, 7-?, 8-O. So only if O gets 7, they get two in a row but not a win. Top row: 0-X, 1-?, 2-? \u2014 possible. Let's reassess.\n\nWait \u2014 correct diagonal: cells 0\u20134\u20138 is one diagonal. X has 0, O has 4 and 8 \u2192 this diagonal is blocked because X has 0. Other diagonal: 2\u20134\u20136: 2 is open, 4 is O, 6 is X \u2192 blocked. So O has no immediate win threat.\n\nNow check X\u2019s threats: X has 0 and 6 (both left column). If X plays 3, they get column 0 (vertical), which is 0\u20133\u20136? No: vertical column 0 is positions 0, 3, 6 \u2014 yes! That\u2019s the left column. X has 0 and 6. If X gets 3, they win vertically. So 3 is a winning threat for X.\n\nTherefore, **O must block X from playing 3** \u2014 because if it's X\u2019s turn next, and we don\u2019t block, X will win. But it\u2019s currently **Player 0 (O)\u2019s turn**, and O is to move now.\n\nSo O can **prevent X\u2019s win** by taking **position 3** first.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line. O has center (4) and corner (8). Current positions do not allow a two-move win. Possible lines:\n\n- Diagonals: 0\u20134\u20138 \u2192 blocked by X at 0.\n- 2\u20134\u20136 \u2192 blocked by X at 6.\n- Rows:\n  - Bottom row: 6 (X), 7 (?), 8 (O) \u2192 O can only get two if 7 is taken.\n  - Middle row: 3 (?), 4 (O), 5 (?) \u2192 possible two-in-a-row if O takes 3 or 5.\n  - Top row: 0 (X), 1 (?), 2 (?) \u2192 possible horizontal threat if O gets 1 and 2.\n\nBut **no immediate win possibility** for O in one move.\n\nHowever, **X threatens to win by playing 3** (to complete left column: 0\u20133\u20136). Since it\u2019s O\u2019s turn now, O can **preemptively take 3** to block X\u2019s win.\n\nSo the **priority is defensive**, but the move serves positional control too.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control. Key remaining squares: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- Edges: 1 (top edge), 3 (left edge), 5 (right edge), 7 (bottom edge)\n- Corners: 2 is the last remaining corner.\n\nCorners are valuable, but **position 3 is critical now because it blocks X\u2019s immediate winning threat** (column 0: 0\u20133\u20136).\n\nWhile corner 2 is strong (gives O a top-right corner and potential for top row or right column), **safety comes first**: losing on next turn is worse than missing an opportunity.\n\nSo **position 3 must be taken** to maintain game continuity.\n\nTaking 3 also gives O presence in the middle-left, supports control of middle row, and may help form a horizontal threat later.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that X\u2019s threat of playing 3 to win is real and immediate. Since it's O\u2019s turn, the correct response is to **play 3 now** to block that threat. No other move is acceptable \u2014 any other choice allows X to play 3 next and win.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Consider if there is a move that both blocks and creates a threat. Playing 3 only creates a partial middle row (3\u20134\u20135), but doesn\u2019t create an immediate two-in-a-row win threat. However, **no fork or immediate win is possible**, so best is to play safe. Alternative: play 2? Then O would have 2 and 8, both in row 0 and column 2? 2 and 8 are both in right column (2, 5, 8)? 2 is top-right, 5 middle-right, 8 bottom-right \u2192 yes, right column.\n\nIf O plays 2, then O has 2 and 8 \u2014 that\u2019s two in the right column. Then if O later gets 5, they win vertically.\n\nBut if O plays 2, then X plays 3 \u2192 X wins left column (0\u20133\u20136). So **O cannot play 2** \u2014 it allows X to win immediately.\n\nSimilarly, playing 1, 5, or 7 also allows X to play 3 and win.\n\nOnly **playing 3 prevents X\u2019s win**.\n\nThus, **3 is the only safe move**.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: While corner 2 is the last valuable corner, **board control is meaningless if you lose next turn**. Temporal priority outweighs positional hierarchy. Taking 3 now preserves balance. Furthermore, 3 is an edge, but in this case, it's a **critical intersection** \u2014 part of left column and middle row.\n\nBy taking 3, O contests middle row and denies X a key node.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 **only move 3 prevents X from winning on their next turn**. All other moves lose instantly. This is mandatory.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: No offensive opportunity justifies allowing a loss. Move 3 is forced. Later, O can aim for right column (2 and 5) or middle row (with 5) to create threats.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Though not ideal to spend a move on an edge early, this is a **forced response** due to X\u2019s threat. Positional principles adapt to tactical reality.

The center square (4) controls four potential lines: row 1, column 1, and both diagonals. It is the most valuable square in terms of future influence.

Corner 8 is the most valuable remaining corner \u2014 it opposes X\u2019s corner and forms the opposite diagonal (0\u20134\u20138), which O can now claim. Taking 8 would balance positional strength.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Consider how X could form a fork or multiple threats. If X gets both 2 and 6, combined with 0, they could threaten top row and left column. But more immediately, if X plays 2 next, they threaten top row (0\u20131\u20132). But O in center can block easily. However, O should not allow X to dominate corners. Playing in 8 prevents X from easily taking it later and reduces X\u2019s options.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that move 8 sets up multiple threats. If O takes 8, then O has 4 and 8 \u2014 control of the anti-diagonal. Then future moves to 6 or 2 could set up a fork (e.g., 6 and 2 would give row and column threats). Also, if O has 4 and 8, and later gets 2, that\u2019s a row; if gets 6, that\u2019s a column. Very flexible.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that corner symmetry matters. X has 0; O should take 8 to claim the opposite corner. This is a well-known principle in Tic Tac Toe strategy: when opponent takes a corner, responding with the opposite corner in the next move (especially from center) is optimal. It neutralizes X\u2019s corner influence and maximizes O\u2019s control.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 no immediate threat, but move 8 prevents X from gaining positional dominance and blocks potential diagonal setups. Defensive goals are served.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 move 8 enables O to build toward a fork via 2 or 6 later. Strongest offensive move.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 8 is the optimal response to X taking 0 while O holds center. Maintains balance and initiative.\n\n[Consensus reached: All three experts agree on move 8]\n\n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]   \n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Analyze Player O's threats. O has now placed in cell 8, creating the potential for a win if they get either position 6 next (forming column win) or position 2 (forming a diagonal win). Preventing these two threats is crucial.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Examine chances to set up a winning opportunity. With O positioned in cells 4 and 8, X needs to create a two-in-a-row scenario. Hence, while blocking O, I also need to look for positions that will help me set up my own threat.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Assess the current board positions. X occupies corner 0 and must now control the game. Notably, O has both a corner and the center, which are significant advantages. X should aim for one of the remaining corner cells to create a fork risk.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Identify immediate threats. O can win by playing 6 on their next turn, filling the leftmost column. Therefore, this must be blocked. Position 6 is crucial for my defensive move.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that blocking O's position 6 is essential. By doing this, I also retain the potential to create my own winning row or column alignment. Position 6 is a necessary move.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Evaluate the necessity of blocking O. No matter the future board states, position 6 must be occupied to prevent O from winning. It's not just about blocking but seizing control back from O. \n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Conclude that the best move is definitely position 6. Blocking O from winning is the top priority, ensuring that I retain control.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Final assessment supports my earlier suggestion to occupy 6. While blocking O, it also helps pave the way for potential opportunities later.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Final assessment confirms that 6 is the optimal move to defend against imminent threats while allowing for future control.\n\n[Consensus reached: All three experts agree on move 6]\n\n[6]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Analyze immediate threats from Player X (X). X occupies positions 0 and 6 (left column), which forms a partial vertical line. However, O already controls center (4), so X cannot win with left column unless they get both 3 and another move \u2014 but 3 is still available. No immediate two-in-a-row for X. Check O's own winning chances: O has 4 and 8. If O gets 2, that completes the diagonal (2\u20134\u20136? No \u2014 2, 4, 6 is not diagonal). Wait: O has 4 and 8. Diagonal win requires 0\u20134\u20138, but 0 is taken by X. The other diagonal is 2\u20134\u20136, but 6 is X. So no immediate win for O. Wait \u2014 correction: O\u2019s diagonal is 6\u20134\u20132? 6 is X. 8\u20134\u20130? 0 is X. So O's current marks (4 and 8) do not form an active two-in-a-row threat. But O could aim for bottom row: 6-X, 7-?, 8-O. So only if O gets 7, they get two in a row but not a win. Top row: 0-X, 1-?, 2-? \u2014 possible. Let's reassess.\n\nWait \u2014 correct diagonal: cells 0\u20134\u20138 is one diagonal. X has 0, O has 4 and 8 \u2192 this diagonal is blocked because X has 0. Other diagonal: 2\u20134\u20136: 2 is open, 4 is O, 6 is X \u2192 blocked. So O has no immediate win threat.\n\nNow check X\u2019s threats: X has 0 and 6 (both left column). If X plays 3, they get column 0 (vertical), which is 0\u20133\u20136? No: vertical column 0 is positions 0, 3, 6 \u2014 yes! That\u2019s the left column. X has 0 and 6. If X gets 3, they win vertically. So 3 is a winning threat for X.\n\nTherefore, **O must block X from playing 3** \u2014 because if it's X\u2019s turn next, and we don\u2019t block, X will win. But it\u2019s currently **Player 0 (O)\u2019s turn**, and O is to move now.\n\nSo O can **prevent X\u2019s win** by taking **position 3** first.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line. O has center (4) and corner (8). Current positions do not allow a two-move win. Possible lines:\n\n- Diagonals: 0\u20134\u20138 \u2192 blocked by X at 0.\n- 2\u20134\u20136 \u2192 blocked by X at 6.\n- Rows:\n  - Bottom row: 6 (X), 7 (?), 8 (O) \u2192 O can only get two if 7 is taken.\n  - Middle row: 3 (?), 4 (O), 5 (?) \u2192 possible two-in-a-row if O takes 3 or 5.\n  - Top row: 0 (X), 1 (?), 2 (?) \u2192 possible horizontal threat if O gets 1 and 2.\n\nBut **no immediate win possibility** for O in one move.\n\nHowever, **X threatens to win by playing 3** (to complete left column: 0\u20133\u20136). Since it\u2019s O\u2019s turn now, O can **preemptively take 3** to block X\u2019s win.\n\nSo the **priority is defensive**, but the move serves positional control too.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control. Key remaining squares: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- Edges: 1 (top edge), 3 (left edge), 5 (right edge), 7 (bottom edge)\n- Corners: 2 is the last remaining corner.\n\nCorners are valuable, but **position 3 is critical now because it blocks X\u2019s immediate winning threat** (column 0: 0\u20133\u20136).\n\nWhile corner 2 is strong (gives O a top-right corner and potential for top row or right column), **safety comes first**: losing on next turn is worse than missing an opportunity.\n\nSo **position 3 must be taken** to maintain game continuity.\n\nTaking 3 also gives O presence in the middle-left, supports control of middle row, and may help form a horizontal threat later.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that X\u2019s threat of playing 3 to win is real and immediate. Since it's O\u2019s turn, the correct response is to **play 3 now** to block that threat. No other move is acceptable \u2014 any other choice allows X to play 3 next and win.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Consider if there is a move that both blocks and creates a threat. Playing 3 only creates a partial middle row (3\u20134\u20135), but doesn\u2019t create an immediate two-in-a-row win threat. However, **no fork or immediate win is possible**, so best is to play safe. Alternative: play 2? Then O would have 2 and 8, both in row 0 and column 2? 2 and 8 are both in right column (2, 5, 8)? 2 is top-right, 5 middle-right, 8 bottom-right \u2192 yes, right column.\n\nIf O plays 2, then O has 2 and 8 \u2014 that\u2019s two in the right column. Then if O later gets 5, they win vertically.\n\nBut if O plays 2, then X plays 3 \u2192 X wins left column (0\u20133\u20136). So **O cannot play 2** \u2014 it allows X to win immediately.\n\nSimilarly, playing 1, 5, or 7 also allows X to play 3 and win.\n\nOnly **playing 3 prevents X\u2019s win**.\n\nThus, **3 is the only safe move**.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: While corner 2 is the last valuable corner, **board control is meaningless if you lose next turn**. Temporal priority outweighs positional hierarchy. Taking 3 now preserves balance. Furthermore, 3 is an edge, but in this case, it's a **critical intersection** \u2014 part of left column and middle row.\n\nBy taking 3, O contests middle row and denies X a key node.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 **only move 3 prevents X from winning on their next turn**. All other moves lose instantly. This is mandatory.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: No offensive opportunity justifies allowing a loss. Move 3 is forced. Later, O can aim for right column (2 and 5) or middle row (with 5) to create threats.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Though not ideal to spend a move on an edge early, this is a **forced response** due to X\u2019s threat. Positional principles adapt to tactical reality. Move 3 is correct.\n\n[Consensus reached: All three experts agree on move 3]\n\n[3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  [Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Analyze immediate threats from Player O (O). O occupies positions 3 and 4 but has not formed a two-in-a-row yet. However, if O plays 5 next, they create a two-in-a-row in the middle row (3\u20134\u20135). Therefore, blocking position 5 is critical in my next move to avoid giving O a chance to win.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to establish a winning path while considering O's future threats. Currently, O has two in the middle row (3 and 4) and can win with position 5. Additionally, I should strive to create a winning path for X by focusing on available positions.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate the situation on the board. With O in positions 3 and 4, controlling position 5 is paramount. Failing to block it allows O to win on their next turn, which is unacceptable. At the same time, I need to consider my own potential paths for a win.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Confirm the immediate threat \u2014 if O takes position 5, they win. Therefore, for me, the only logical move is to play in position 5 to prevent O from completing their line.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: After assessing the board, I agree that blocking position 5 is critical to prevent O from winning. While doing so, I'm also looking at future potential threats to create my own opportunity.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: I concur with the necessity to block position 5. It maintains my defensive position while keeping control of the board as I aim for potential winning paths beyond this turn.\n\n[All experts proceed to the next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final consensus confirms: taking position 5 is essential to block O's immediate winning opportunity.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Blockade move at position 5 is the best choice for survival this turn.

      "response": "[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Analyze immediate threats from Player X (X). X currently occupies positions 0, 5, and 6. Check all possible winning lines:\n\n- Top row (0\u20131\u20132): X has 0, needs 1 and 2 \u2014 not an immediate threat.\n- Middle row (3\u20134\u20135): O has 3 and 4, X has 5 \u2014 blocked.\n- Bottom row (6\u20137\u20138): X has 6, O has 8 \u2014 if X gets 7, they complete the row and win.\n- Left column (0\u20133\u20136): X has 0 and 6, O has 3 \u2014 blocked.\n- Middle column (1\u20134\u20137): O has 4, X has neither 1 nor 7 yet \u2014 potential.\n- Right column (2\u20135\u20138): X has 5, O has 8 \u2014 if X gets 2, then 5 and 2, but 8 is O \u2014 blocked.\n- Diagonal 0\u20134\u20138: X has 0, O has 4 and 8 \u2014 blocked.\n- Diagonal 2\u20134\u20136: X has 6, O has 4 \u2014 if X gets 2, not enough; 2 and 6 with 4 blocked by O.\n\n**Critical observation**: If X plays **7**, they complete the bottom row (6\u20137\u20138) and win. Therefore, **position 7 is an immediate winning threat for X**.\n\nSince it is **Player 0 (O)\u2019s turn**, O must **prevent X from playing 7** by taking it first.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line for O. O has 3, 4, and 8. Current positions:\n\n- Middle row: 3\u20134\u20135 \u2192 X has 5, so cannot win here.\n- Diagonals: both blocked.\n- Bottom row: 6 (X), 7 (?), 8 (O) \u2192 if O takes 7, they block X *and* get two in a row (7\u20138), though no win possible (6 is X).\n- Right column (2\u20135\u20138): 5 is X, 8 is O \u2014 blocked.\n- Top row: 0 is X, 1 and 2 open \u2014 possible, but not imminent.\n\nNo two-move win possible for O. However, **playing 7 blocks X\u2019s win** and secures a position in the bottom edge.\n\nOther options: \n- Play 1? No immediate line.\n- Play 2? Gives presence in top-right, but doesn\u2019t create two-in-a-row. O would have 2 and 8 \u2192 right column: 2, 5 (X), 8 \u2192 blocked.\n\nThus, **no offensive move threatens win**, but **7 is the only move that prevents loss**.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate remaining positions: 1, 2, 7.\n\n- 1: top edge \u2014 low influence.\n- 2: top-right corner \u2014 high value, last corner available.\n- 7: bottom edge \u2014 part of bottom row and middle column.\n\nWhile corner 2 is traditionally more valuable, **tactical necessity overrides positional hierarchy**. The bottom row is active: X has 6, O has 8, and 7 is the pivot. Whoever takes 7 controls the row.\n\nMoreover, if O does *not* take 7, X will take it and win immediately.\n\nTherefore, **7 must be taken now**, regardless of positional preference.\n\nTaking 7 also contributes to middle column (1\u20134\u20137): O would have 4 and 7, setting up a potential two-in-a-row if O later gets 1.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that **failure to play 7 results in loss on next turn**. X will play 7 and win the bottom row. This is the **only critical threat** on the board. All other moves lose the game immediately. Therefore, **7 is forced**.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that while no offensive fork or win is possible this move, **playing 7 both blocks and sets up a potential future threat in the middle column (1\u20134\u20137)**. If O later gets 1, they have two in a column. This move has **defensive and mild offensive utility**.\n\nNo other move offers even that.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Though corner 2 is desirable, the **principle of threat priority** dictates move 7. In expert Tic Tac Toe play, **tempo and threat prevention outweigh static value when a loss is imminent**. The move to 7 is tactically sound and positionally acceptable.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 **only move 7 prevents immediate loss**.

Therefore, Player X cannot win on the next move, and there is no immediate threat to block.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line in the near future. Since the board is empty, no moves have been made yet. My goal is to take the most central and influential position to maximize future winning chances. The center (position 4) is optimal for creating multiple lines (middle row, middle column, both diagonals).\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control and influence. The center square (4) controls four potential lines: row 1, column 1, and both diagonals. It is the most valuable square in terms of future influence. Corners (0, 2, 6, 8) are next in value, followed by edges (1, 3, 5, 7). With no pieces on the board, maximizing control early is key.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Since there is no immediate threat, shift focus to anticipating future threats. By taking a strong position now, we reduce the opponent\u2019s ability to create threats later. The center (4) denies X the most control if we take it first. Thus, playing defensively aligns with taking the center.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that center (4) is best for creating two-in-a-row setups and forks later. From center, O can participate in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins. First move should maximize flexibility \u2014 center provides that.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that center (4) establishes dominance in board geometry.

While there are currently no immediate threats, we must be cautious to prevent O from gaining control.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to establish a strong offensive position. Given O is in the center, I need to prioritize creating my own opportunities while ensuring O doesn't easily form a winning line. It\u2019s crucial to create two-in-a-row scenarios.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate current board control. O in position 4 is the strongest position, and thus it's imperative to counter that. I need to place myself in a way that either prepares for the next moves or counters O's position effectively.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Identify positions that would allow O to win in their next move. If I don\u2019t prevent O from forming a line, they can easily create two threats by taking either position 1 or 3 next to their center. Thus, placing in positions adjacent to the center is crucial.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Assess opportunities to build my sequences. I can either play in one of the corners and aim for forks later or block O\u2019s possible winning moves. The corners (0, 2, 6, 8) would be good offensive positions while staying defensive.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Reassess control of the board with O in the center.

However, if X gets both 0 and 2 (top row), or 0 and 6 (left column), or 0 and 8 (diagonal), it could become dangerous. Need to monitor these.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line. O is in the center (4), which is strong. To build toward a win, O should aim for positions that complement the center \u2014 especially corners opposite to X or positions that create two-in-a-row setups. Possible forks can be created by playing in corner 8 (bottom-right), which gives a diagonal with 0\u20134\u20138 and shares row/column with 6 and 2.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control. X has taken corner 0. O has center 4. The remaining key positions are corners 2, 6, 8 and edges. Corner 8 is the most valuable remaining corner \u2014 it opposes X\u2019s corner and forms the opposite diagonal (0\u20134\u20138), which O can now claim. Taking 8 would balance positional strength.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Consider how X could form a fork or multiple threats. If X gets both 2 and 6, combined with 0, they could threaten top row and left column. But more immediately, if X plays 2 next, they threaten top row (0\u20131\u20132). But O in center can block easily. However, O should not allow X to dominate corners. Playing in 8 prevents X from easily taking it later and reduces X\u2019s options.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that move 8 sets up multiple threats. If O takes 8, then O has 4 and 8 \u2014 control of the anti-diagonal. Then future moves to 6 or 2 could set up a fork (e.g., 6 and 2 would give row and column threats). Also, if O has 4 and 8, and later gets 2, that\u2019s a row; if gets 6, that\u2019s a column. Very flexible.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that corner symmetry matters. X has 0; O should take 8 to claim the opposite corner. This is a well-known principle in Tic Tac Toe strategy: when opponent takes a corner, responding with the opposite corner in the next move (especially from center) is optimal. It neutralizes X\u2019s corner influence and maximizes O\u2019s control.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 no immediate threat, but move 8 prevents X from gaining positional dominance and blocks potential diagonal setups. Defensive goals are served.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 move 8 enables O to build toward a fork via 2 or 6 later. Strongest offensive move.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 8 is the optimal response to X taking 0 while O holds center. Maintains balance and initiative.\n\n[Consensus reached: All three experts agree on move 8]\n\n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]   \n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Analyze Player O's threats. O has now placed in cell 8, creating the potential for a win if they get either position 6 next (forming column win) or position 2 (forming a diagonal win). Preventing these two threats is crucial.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Examine chances to set up a winning opportunity. With O positioned in cells 4 and 8, X needs to create a two-in-a-row scenario. Hence, while blocking O, I also need to look for positions that will help me set up my own threat.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Assess the current board positions. X occupies corner 0 and must now control the game. Notably, O has both a corner and the center, which are significant advantages. X should aim for one of the remaining corner cells to create a fork risk.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Identify immediate threats. O can win by playing 6 on their next turn, filling the leftmost column. Therefore, this must be blocked. Position 6 is crucial for my defensive move.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that blocking O's position 6 is essential. By doing this, I also retain the potential to create my own winning row or column alignment. Position 6 is a necessary move.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Evaluate the necessity of blocking O. No matter the future board states, position 6 must be occupied to prevent O from winning. It's not just about blocking but seizing control back from O. \n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Conclude that the best move is definitely position 6. Blocking O from winning is the top priority, ensuring that I retain control.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Final assessment supports my earlier suggestion to occupy 6. While blocking O, it also helps pave the way for potential opportunities later.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Final assessment confirms that 6 is the optimal move to defend against imminent threats while allowing for future control.\n\n[Consensus reached: All three experts agree on move 6]\n\n[6]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Analyze immediate threats from Player X (X). X occupies positions 0 and 6 (left column), which forms a partial vertical line. However, O already controls center (4), so X cannot win with left column unless they get both 3 and another move \u2014 but 3 is still available. No immediate two-in-a-row for X. Check O's own winning chances: O has 4 and 8. If O gets 2, that completes the diagonal (2\u20134\u20136? No \u2014 2, 4, 6 is not diagonal). Wait: O has 4 and 8. Diagonal win requires 0\u20134\u20138, but 0 is taken by X. The other diagonal is 2\u20134\u20136, but 6 is X. So no immediate win for O. Wait \u2014 correction: O\u2019s diagonal is 6\u20134\u20132? 6 is X. 8\u20134\u20130? 0 is X. So O's current marks (4 and 8) do not form an active two-in-a-row threat. But O could aim for bottom row: 6-X, 7-?, 8-O. So only if O gets 7, they get two in a row but not a win. Top row: 0-X, 1-?, 2-? \u2014 possible. Let's reassess.\n\nWait \u2014 correct diagonal: cells 0\u20134\u20138 is one diagonal. X has 0, O has 4 and 8 \u2192 this diagonal is blocked because X has 0. Other diagonal: 2\u20134\u20136: 2 is open, 4 is O, 6 is X \u2192 blocked. So O has no immediate win threat.\n\nNow check X\u2019s threats: X has 0 and 6 (both left column). If X plays 3, they get column 0 (vertical), which is 0\u20133\u20136? No: vertical column 0 is positions 0, 3, 6 \u2014 yes! That\u2019s the left column. X has 0 and 6. If X gets 3, they win vertically. So 3 is a winning threat for X.\n\nTherefore, **O must block X from playing 3** \u2014 because if it's X\u2019s turn next, and we don\u2019t block, X will win. But it\u2019s currently **Player 0 (O)\u2019s turn**, and O is to move now.\n\nSo O can **prevent X\u2019s win** by taking **position 3** first.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line. O has center (4) and corner (8). Current positions do not allow a two-move win. Possible lines:\n\n- Diagonals: 0\u20134\u20138 \u2192 blocked by X at 0.\n- 2\u20134\u20136 \u2192 blocked by X at 6.\n- Rows:\n  - Bottom row: 6 (X), 7 (?), 8 (O) \u2192 O can only get two if 7 is taken.\n  - Middle row: 3 (?), 4 (O), 5 (?) \u2192 possible two-in-a-row if O takes 3 or 5.\n  - Top row: 0 (X), 1 (?), 2 (?) \u2192 possible horizontal threat if O gets 1 and 2.\n\nBut **no immediate win possibility** for O in one move.\n\nHowever, **X threatens to win by playing 3** (to complete left column: 0\u20133\u20136). Since it\u2019s O\u2019s turn now, O can **preemptively take 3** to block X\u2019s win.\n\nSo the **priority is defensive**, but the move serves positional control too.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control. Key remaining squares: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- Edges: 1 (top edge), 3 (left edge), 5 (right edge), 7 (bottom edge)\n- Corners: 2 is the last remaining corner.\n\nCorners are valuable, but **position 3 is critical now because it blocks X\u2019s immediate winning threat** (column 0: 0\u20133\u20136).\n\nWhile corner 2 is strong (gives O a top-right corner and potential for top row or right column), **safety comes first**: losing on next turn is worse than missing an opportunity.\n\nSo **position 3 must be taken** to maintain game continuity.\n\nTaking 3 also gives O presence in the middle-left, supports control of middle row, and may help form a horizontal threat later.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that X\u2019s threat of playing 3 to win is real and immediate. Since it's O\u2019s turn, the correct response is to **play 3 now** to block that threat. No other move is acceptable \u2014 any other choice allows X to play 3 next and win.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Consider if there is a move that both blocks and creates a threat. Playing 3 only creates a partial middle row (3\u20134\u20135), but doesn\u2019t create an immediate two-in-a-row win threat. However, **no fork or immediate win is possible**, so best is to play safe. Alternative: play 2? Then O would have 2 and 8, both in row 0 and column 2? 2 and 8 are both in right column (2, 5, 8)? 2 is top-right, 5 middle-right, 8 bottom-right \u2192 yes, right column.\n\nIf O plays 2, then O has 2 and 8 \u2014 that\u2019s two in the right column. Then if O later gets 5, they win vertically.\n\nBut if O plays 2, then X plays 3 \u2192 X wins left column (0\u20133\u20136). So **O cannot play 2** \u2014 it allows X to win immediately.\n\nSimilarly, playing 1, 5, or 7 also allows X to play 3 and win.\n\nOnly **playing 3 prevents X\u2019s win**.\n\nThus, **3 is the only safe move**.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: While corner 2 is the last valuable corner, **board control is meaningless if you lose next turn**. Temporal priority outweighs positional hierarchy. Taking 3 now preserves balance. Furthermore, 3 is an edge, but in this case, it's a **critical intersection** \u2014 part of left column and middle row.\n\nBy taking 3, O contests middle row and denies X a key node.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 **only move 3 prevents X from winning on their next turn**. All other moves lose instantly. This is mandatory.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: No offensive opportunity justifies allowing a loss. Move 3 is forced. Later, O can aim for right column (2 and 5) or middle row (with 5) to create threats.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Though not ideal to spend a move on an edge early, this is a **forced response** due to X\u2019s threat. Positional principles adapt to tactical reality. Move 3 is correct.\n\n[Consensus reached: All three experts agree on move 3]\n\n[3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  [Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Analyze immediate threats from Player O (O). O occupies positions 3 and 4 but has not formed a two-in-a-row yet. However, if O plays 5 next, they create a two-in-a-row in the middle row (3\u20134\u20135). Therefore, blocking position 5 is critical in my next move to avoid giving O a chance to win.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to establish a winning path while considering O's future threats. Currently, O has two in the middle row (3 and 4) and can win with position 5. Additionally, I should strive to create a winning path for X by focusing on available positions.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate the situation on the board. With O in positions 3 and 4, controlling position 5 is paramount. Failing to block it allows O to win on their next turn, which is unacceptable. At the same time, I need to consider my own potential paths for a win.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Confirm the immediate threat \u2014 if O takes position 5, they win. Therefore, for me, the only logical move is to play in position 5 to prevent O from completing their line.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: After assessing the board, I agree that blocking position 5 is critical to prevent O from winning. While doing so, I'm also looking at future potential threats to create my own opportunity.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: I concur with the necessity to block position 5. It maintains my defensive position while keeping control of the board as I aim for potential winning paths beyond this turn.\n\n[All experts proceed to the next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final consensus confirms: taking position 5 is essential to block O's immediate winning opportunity.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Blockade move at position 5 is the best choice for survival this turn.

X currently occupies positions 0, 5, and 6. Check all possible winning lines:\n\n- Top row (0\u20131\u20132): X has 0, needs 1 and 2 \u2014 not an immediate threat.\n- Middle row (3\u20134\u20135): O has 3 and 4, X has 5 \u2014 blocked.\n- Bottom row (6\u20137\u20138): X has 6, O has 8 \u2014 if X gets 7, they complete the row and win.\n- Left column (0\u20133\u20136): X has 0 and 6, O has 3 \u2014 blocked.\n- Middle column (1\u20134\u20137): O has 4, X has neither 1 nor 7 yet \u2014 potential.\n- Right column (2\u20135\u20138): X has 5, O has 8 \u2014 if X gets 2, then 5 and 2, but 8 is O \u2014 blocked.\n- Diagonal 0\u20134\u20138: X has 0, O has 4 and 8 \u2014 blocked.\n- Diagonal 2\u20134\u20136: X has 6, O has 4 \u2014 if X gets 2, not enough; 2 and 6 with 4 blocked by O.\n\n**Critical observation**: If X plays **7**, they complete the bottom row (6\u20137\u20138) and win. Therefore, **position 7 is an immediate winning threat for X**.\n\nSince it is **Player 0 (O)\u2019s turn**, O must **prevent X from playing 7** by taking it first.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line for O. O has 3, 4, and 8. Current positions:\n\n- Middle row: 3\u20134\u20135 \u2192 X has 5, so cannot win here.\n- Diagonals: both blocked.\n- Bottom row: 6 (X), 7 (?), 8 (O) \u2192 if O takes 7, they block X *and* get two in a row (7\u20138), though no win possible (6 is X).\n- Right column (2\u20135\u20138): 5 is X, 8 is O \u2014 blocked.\n- Top row: 0 is X, 1 and 2 open \u2014 possible, but not imminent.\n\nNo two-move win possible for O. However, **playing 7 blocks X\u2019s win** and secures a position in the bottom edge.\n\nOther options: \n- Play 1? No immediate line.\n- Play 2? Gives presence in top-right, but doesn\u2019t create two-in-a-row. O would have 2 and 8 \u2192 right column: 2, 5 (X), 8 \u2192 blocked.\n\nThus, **no offensive move threatens win**, but **7 is the only move that prevents loss**.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate remaining positions: 1, 2, 7.\n\n- 1: top edge \u2014 low influence.\n- 2: top-right corner \u2014 high value, last corner available.\n- 7: bottom edge \u2014 part of bottom row and middle column.\n\nWhile corner 2 is traditionally more valuable, **tactical necessity overrides positional hierarchy**. The bottom row is active: X has 6, O has 8, and 7 is the pivot. Whoever takes 7 controls the row.\n\nMoreover, if O does *not* take 7, X will take it and win immediately.\n\nTherefore, **7 must be taken now**, regardless of positional preference.\n\nTaking 7 also contributes to middle column (1\u20134\u20137): O would have 4 and 7, setting up a potential two-in-a-row if O later gets 1.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that **failure to play 7 results in loss on next turn**. X will play 7 and win the bottom row. This is the **only critical threat** on the board. All other moves lose the game immediately. Therefore, **7 is forced**.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that while no offensive fork or win is possible this move, **playing 7 both blocks and sets up a potential future threat in the middle column (1\u20134\u20137)**. If O later gets 1, they have two in a column. This move has **defensive and mild offensive utility**.\n\nNo other move offers even that.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Though corner 2 is desirable, the **principle of threat priority** dictates move 7. In expert Tic Tac Toe play, **tempo and threat prevention outweigh static value when a loss is imminent**. The move to 7 is tactically sound and positionally acceptable.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 **only move 7 prevents immediate loss**.

This is a major threat that must be evaluated.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line. At this point, I need to consider the available moves and their potential outcomes. Currently, O has position 3\u20134\u20137, with 5 blocked and can threaten with position 1. A winning line would consist of O securing both position 1 and 2.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Assess the board state.

Since the board is empty, no moves have been made yet. My goal is to take the most central and influential position to maximize future winning chances. The center (position 4) is optimal for creating multiple lines (middle row, middle column, both diagonals).\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control and influence. The center square (4) controls four potential lines: row 1, column 1, and both diagonals. It is the most valuable square in terms of future influence. Corners (0, 2, 6, 8) are next in value, followed by edges (1, 3, 5, 7). With no pieces on the board, maximizing control early is key.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Since there is no immediate threat, shift focus to anticipating future threats. By taking a strong position now, we reduce the opponent\u2019s ability to create threats later. The center (4) denies X the most control if we take it first. Thus, playing defensively aligns with taking the center.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that center (4) is best for creating two-in-a-row setups and forks later. From center, O can participate in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins. First move should maximize flexibility \u2014 center provides that.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that center (4) establishes dominance in board geometry. It allows transposition into multiple formations and gives the best response options no matter where X plays next. First-player advantage is maximized by taking the center.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 no contradictions. No immediate threat, so best move is prophylactic: deny opponent space and control. Center is correct.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 center (4) enables fastest path to potential forks and two threats. Confirmed.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 every metric points to center. Optimal opening.\n\n[Consensus reached: All three experts agree on move 4]\n\n[4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Analyze if there are immediate threats from Player O (O). Player O has taken the center (4), which gives them power to create future threats. While there are currently no immediate threats, we must be cautious to prevent O from gaining control.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to establish a strong offensive position. Given O is in the center, I need to prioritize creating my own opportunities while ensuring O doesn't easily form a winning line. It\u2019s crucial to create two-in-a-row scenarios.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate current board control. O in position 4 is the strongest position, and thus it's imperative to counter that. I need to place myself in a way that either prepares for the next moves or counters O's position effectively.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Identify positions that would allow O to win in their next move. If I don\u2019t prevent O from forming a line, they can easily create two threats by taking either position 1 or 3 next to their center. Thus, placing in positions adjacent to the center is crucial.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Assess opportunities to build my sequences. I can either play in one of the corners and aim for forks later or block O\u2019s possible winning moves. The corners (0, 2, 6, 8) would be good offensive positions while staying defensive.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Reassess control of the board with O in the center. The next moves should be definitively strategic. Playing in a corner (e.g. position 0) is likely to yield future control while also defending against O's upcoming threats.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Conclude that immediate attention should be given to the corners, particularly position 0 or 2, which can serve both defensive and offensive purposes. I will recommend my move as 0.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Center dominance is crucial, so taking corners or working toward the middle row is a priority. I will also suggest position 0 as it creates a potential winning line.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Evaluate corners as good options that maintain control without ceding power to O. Position 0 offers solid board control and the potential to fork in subsequent moves. I will also approve move to 0.\n\n[Consensus reached: All three experts agree on move 0]\n\n[0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0]  [Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Identify any immediate threats from Player X (X). X occupies position 0 (top-left corner), and O controls the center (4). X does not have two in a row yet, so no immediate win threat exists. However, if X gets both 0 and 2 (top row), or 0 and 6 (left column), or 0 and 8 (diagonal), it could become dangerous. Need to monitor these.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line. O is in the center (4), which is strong. To build toward a win, O should aim for positions that complement the center \u2014 especially corners opposite to X or positions that create two-in-a-row setups. Possible forks can be created by playing in corner 8 (bottom-right), which gives a diagonal with 0\u20134\u20138 and shares row/column with 6 and 2.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control. X has taken corner 0. O has center 4. The remaining key positions are corners 2, 6, 8 and edges. Corner 8 is the most valuable remaining corner \u2014 it opposes X\u2019s corner and forms the opposite diagonal (0\u20134\u20138), which O can now claim. Taking 8 would balance positional strength.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Consider how X could form a fork or multiple threats. If X gets both 2 and 6, combined with 0, they could threaten top row and left column. But more immediately, if X plays 2 next, they threaten top row (0\u20131\u20132). But O in center can block easily. However, O should not allow X to dominate corners. Playing in 8 prevents X from easily taking it later and reduces X\u2019s options.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that move 8 sets up multiple threats. If O takes 8, then O has 4 and 8 \u2014 control of the anti-diagonal. Then future moves to 6 or 2 could set up a fork (e.g., 6 and 2 would give row and column threats). Also, if O has 4 and 8, and later gets 2, that\u2019s a row; if gets 6, that\u2019s a column. Very flexible.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that corner symmetry matters. X has 0; O should take 8 to claim the opposite corner. This is a well-known principle in Tic Tac Toe strategy: when opponent takes a corner, responding with the opposite corner in the next move (especially from center) is optimal. It neutralizes X\u2019s corner influence and maximizes O\u2019s control.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 no immediate threat, but move 8 prevents X from gaining positional dominance and blocks potential diagonal setups. Defensive goals are served.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 move 8 enables O to build toward a fork via 2 or 6 later. Strongest offensive move.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 8 is the optimal response to X taking 0 while O holds center. Maintains balance and initiative.\n\n[Consensus reached: All three experts agree on move 8]\n\n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]   \n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Analyze Player O's threats. O has now placed in cell 8, creating the potential for a win if they get either position 6 next (forming column win) or position 2 (forming a diagonal win). Preventing these two threats is crucial.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Examine chances to set up a winning opportunity. With O positioned in cells 4 and 8, X needs to create a two-in-a-row scenario. Hence, while blocking O, I also need to look for positions that will help me set up my own threat.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Assess the current board positions. X occupies corner 0 and must now control the game. Notably, O has both a corner and the center, which are significant advantages. X should aim for one of the remaining corner cells to create a fork risk.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Identify immediate threats. O can win by playing 6 on their next turn, filling the leftmost column. Therefore, this must be blocked. Position 6 is crucial for my defensive move.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that blocking O's position 6 is essential. By doing this, I also retain the potential to create my own winning row or column alignment. Position 6 is a necessary move.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Evaluate the necessity of blocking O. No matter the future board states, position 6 must be occupied to prevent O from winning. It's not just about blocking but seizing control back from O. \n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Conclude that the best move is definitely position 6. Blocking O from winning is the top priority, ensuring that I retain control.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Final assessment supports my earlier suggestion to occupy 6. While blocking O, it also helps pave the way for potential opportunities later.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Final assessment confirms that 6 is the optimal move to defend against imminent threats while allowing for future control.\n\n[Consensus reached: All three experts agree on move 6]\n\n[6]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Analyze immediate threats from Player X (X). X occupies positions 0 and 6 (left column), which forms a partial vertical line. However, O already controls center (4), so X cannot win with left column unless they get both 3 and another move \u2014 but 3 is still available. No immediate two-in-a-row for X. Check O's own winning chances: O has 4 and 8. If O gets 2, that completes the diagonal (2\u20134\u20136? No \u2014 2, 4, 6 is not diagonal). Wait: O has 4 and 8. Diagonal win requires 0\u20134\u20138, but 0 is taken by X. The other diagonal is 2\u20134\u20136, but 6 is X. So no immediate win for O. Wait \u2014 correction: O\u2019s diagonal is 6\u20134\u20132? 6 is X. 8\u20134\u20130? 0 is X. So O's current marks (4 and 8) do not form an active two-in-a-row threat. But O could aim for bottom row: 6-X, 7-?, 8-O. So only if O gets 7, they get two in a row but not a win. Top row: 0-X, 1-?, 2-? \u2014 possible. Let's reassess.\n\nWait \u2014 correct diagonal: cells 0\u20134\u20138 is one diagonal. X has 0, O has 4 and 8 \u2192 this diagonal is blocked because X has 0. Other diagonal: 2\u20134\u20136: 2 is open, 4 is O, 6 is X \u2192 blocked. So O has no immediate win threat.\n\nNow check X\u2019s threats: X has 0 and 6 (both left column). If X plays 3, they get column 0 (vertical), which is 0\u20133\u20136? No: vertical column 0 is positions 0, 3, 6 \u2014 yes! That\u2019s the left column. X has 0 and 6. If X gets 3, they win vertically. So 3 is a winning threat for X.\n\nTherefore, **O must block X from playing 3** \u2014 because if it's X\u2019s turn next, and we don\u2019t block, X will win. But it\u2019s currently **Player 0 (O)\u2019s turn**, and O is to move now.\n\nSo O can **prevent X\u2019s win** by taking **position 3** first.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line. O has center (4) and corner (8). Current positions do not allow a two-move win. Possible lines:\n\n- Diagonals: 0\u20134\u20138 \u2192 blocked by X at 0.\n- 2\u20134\u20136 \u2192 blocked by X at 6.\n- Rows:\n  - Bottom row: 6 (X), 7 (?), 8 (O) \u2192 O can only get two if 7 is taken.\n  - Middle row: 3 (?), 4 (O), 5 (?) \u2192 possible two-in-a-row if O takes 3 or 5.\n  - Top row: 0 (X), 1 (?), 2 (?) \u2192 possible horizontal threat if O gets 1 and 2.\n\nBut **no immediate win possibility** for O in one move.\n\nHowever, **X threatens to win by playing 3** (to complete left column: 0\u20133\u20136). Since it\u2019s O\u2019s turn now, O can **preemptively take 3** to block X\u2019s win.\n\nSo the **priority is defensive**, but the move serves positional control too.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate board control. Key remaining squares: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n- Edges: 1 (top edge), 3 (left edge), 5 (right edge), 7 (bottom edge)\n- Corners: 2 is the last remaining corner.\n\nCorners are valuable, but **position 3 is critical now because it blocks X\u2019s immediate winning threat** (column 0: 0\u20133\u20136).\n\nWhile corner 2 is strong (gives O a top-right corner and potential for top row or right column), **safety comes first**: losing on next turn is worse than missing an opportunity.\n\nSo **position 3 must be taken** to maintain game continuity.\n\nTaking 3 also gives O presence in the middle-left, supports control of middle row, and may help form a horizontal threat later.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that X\u2019s threat of playing 3 to win is real and immediate. Since it's O\u2019s turn, the correct response is to **play 3 now** to block that threat. No other move is acceptable \u2014 any other choice allows X to play 3 next and win.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Consider if there is a move that both blocks and creates a threat. Playing 3 only creates a partial middle row (3\u20134\u20135), but doesn\u2019t create an immediate two-in-a-row win threat. However, **no fork or immediate win is possible**, so best is to play safe. Alternative: play 2? Then O would have 2 and 8, both in row 0 and column 2? 2 and 8 are both in right column (2, 5, 8)? 2 is top-right, 5 middle-right, 8 bottom-right \u2192 yes, right column.\n\nIf O plays 2, then O has 2 and 8 \u2014 that\u2019s two in the right column. Then if O later gets 5, they win vertically.\n\nBut if O plays 2, then X plays 3 \u2192 X wins left column (0\u20133\u20136). So **O cannot play 2** \u2014 it allows X to win immediately.\n\nSimilarly, playing 1, 5, or 7 also allows X to play 3 and win.\n\nOnly **playing 3 prevents X\u2019s win**.\n\nThus, **3 is the only safe move**.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: While corner 2 is the last valuable corner, **board control is meaningless if you lose next turn**. Temporal priority outweighs positional hierarchy. Taking 3 now preserves balance. Furthermore, 3 is an edge, but in this case, it's a **critical intersection** \u2014 part of left column and middle row.\n\nBy taking 3, O contests middle row and denies X a key node.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 **only move 3 prevents X from winning on their next turn**. All other moves lose instantly. This is mandatory.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: No offensive opportunity justifies allowing a loss. Move 3 is forced. Later, O can aim for right column (2 and 5) or middle row (with 5) to create threats.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 3: Though not ideal to spend a move on an edge early, this is a **forced response** due to X\u2019s threat. Positional principles adapt to tactical reality. Move 3 is correct.\n\n[Consensus reached: All three experts agree on move 3]\n\n[3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  [Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 1: Analyze immediate threats from Player O (O). O occupies positions 3 and 4 but has not formed a two-in-a-row yet. However, if O plays 5 next, they create a two-in-a-row in the middle row (3\u20134\u20135). Therefore, blocking position 5 is critical in my next move to avoid giving O a chance to win.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to establish a winning path while considering O's future threats. Currently, O has two in the middle row (3 and 4) and can win with position 5. Additionally, I should strive to create a winning path for X by focusing on available positions.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate the situation on the board. With O in positions 3 and 4, controlling position 5 is paramount. Failing to block it allows O to win on their next turn, which is unacceptable. At the same time, I need to consider my own potential paths for a win.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Confirm the immediate threat \u2014 if O takes position 5, they win. Therefore, for me, the only logical move is to play in position 5 to prevent O from completing their line.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: After assessing the board, I agree that blocking position 5 is critical to prevent O from winning. While doing so, I'm also looking at future potential threats to create my own opportunity.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: I concur with the necessity to block position 5. It maintains my defensive position while keeping control of the board as I aim for potential winning paths beyond this turn.\n\n[All experts proceed to the next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final consensus confirms: taking position 5 is essential to block O's immediate winning opportunity.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 3: Blockade move at position 5 is the best choice for survival this turn.

X currently occupies positions 0, 5, and 6. Check all possible winning lines:\n\n- Top row (0\u20131\u20132): X has 0, needs 1 and 2 \u2014 not an immediate threat.\n- Middle row (3\u20134\u20135): O has 3 and 4, X has 5 \u2014 blocked.\n- Bottom row (6\u20137\u20138): X has 6, O has 8 \u2014 if X gets 7, they complete the row and win.\n- Left column (0\u20133\u20136): X has 0 and 6, O has 3 \u2014 blocked.\n- Middle column (1\u20134\u20137): O has 4, X has neither 1 nor 7 yet \u2014 potential.\n- Right column (2\u20135\u20138): X has 5, O has 8 \u2014 if X gets 2, then 5 and 2, but 8 is O \u2014 blocked.\n- Diagonal 0\u20134\u20138: X has 0, O has 4 and 8 \u2014 blocked.\n- Diagonal 2\u20134\u20136: X has 6, O has 4 \u2014 if X gets 2, not enough; 2 and 6 with 4 blocked by O.\n\n**Critical observation**: If X plays **7**, they complete the bottom row (6\u20137\u20138) and win. Therefore, **position 7 is an immediate winning threat for X**.\n\nSince it is **Player 0 (O)\u2019s turn**, O must **prevent X from playing 7** by taking it first.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line for O. O has 3, 4, and 8. Current positions:\n\n- Middle row: 3\u20134\u20135 \u2192 X has 5, so cannot win here.\n- Diagonals: both blocked.\n- Bottom row: 6 (X), 7 (?), 8 (O) \u2192 if O takes 7, they block X *and* get two in a row (7\u20138), though no win possible (6 is X).\n- Right column (2\u20135\u20138): 5 is X, 8 is O \u2014 blocked.\n- Top row: 0 is X, 1 and 2 open \u2014 possible, but not imminent.\n\nNo two-move win possible for O. However, **playing 7 blocks X\u2019s win** and secures a position in the bottom edge.\n\nOther options: \n- Play 1? No immediate line.\n- Play 2? Gives presence in top-right, but doesn\u2019t create two-in-a-row. O would have 2 and 8 \u2192 right column: 2, 5 (X), 8 \u2192 blocked.\n\nThus, **no offensive move threatens win**, but **7 is the only move that prevents loss**.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Evaluate remaining positions: 1, 2, 7.\n\n- 1: top edge \u2014 low influence.\n- 2: top-right corner \u2014 high value, last corner available.\n- 7: bottom edge \u2014 part of bottom row and middle column.\n\nWhile corner 2 is traditionally more valuable, **tactical necessity overrides positional hierarchy**. The bottom row is active: X has 6, O has 8, and 7 is the pivot. Whoever takes 7 controls the row.\n\nMoreover, if O does *not* take 7, X will take it and win immediately.\n\nTherefore, **7 must be taken now**, regardless of positional preference.\n\nTaking 7 also contributes to middle column (1\u20134\u20137): O would have 4 and 7, setting up a potential two-in-a-row if O later gets 1.\n\n[All experts proceed to next step]\n\n[Expert 1 - Defensive Strategist]  \nStep 2: Reaffirm that **failure to play 7 results in loss on next turn**. X will play 7 and win the bottom row. This is the **only critical threat** on the board. All other moves lose the game immediately. Therefore, **7 is forced**.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 2: Confirm that while no offensive fork or win is possible this move, **playing 7 both blocks and sets up a potential future threat in the middle column (1\u20134\u20137)**. If O later gets 1, they have two in a column. This move has **defensive and mild offensive utility**.\n\nNo other move offers even that.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 2: Though corner 2 is desirable, the **principle of threat priority** dictates move 7.

O currently occupies positions 3, 4, and 7. Checking the possible winning lines, if O takes position 1, they complete the top row (0\u20131\u20132). This is a major threat that must be evaluated.\n\n[Expert 2 - Offensive Tactician]  \nStep 1: Look for opportunities to create a winning line. At this point, I need to consider the available moves and their potential outcomes. Currently, O has position 3\u20134\u20137, with 5 blocked and can threaten with position 1. A winning line would consist of O securing both position 1 and 2.\n\n[Expert 3 - Positional Expert]  \nStep 1: Assess the board state.
