The recapture on c4 is a priority.\n\nOne of the valid moves is [c3e4], which recaptures the pawn on e4 and develops my knight to a relatively central square. However, I should also consider other options, such as [f1c4], to recapture on c4 with a piece.\n\nAfter evaluating the options, I decide to play [c3e4] to recapture the pawn and maintain a strong central presence.\n\nMy move is: [c3e4]\n\nThis will be communicated in the required format.\n\nMy move is: [c3e4]\n[GAME] Invalid move attempt 1/10: Illegal move: d5c4.
