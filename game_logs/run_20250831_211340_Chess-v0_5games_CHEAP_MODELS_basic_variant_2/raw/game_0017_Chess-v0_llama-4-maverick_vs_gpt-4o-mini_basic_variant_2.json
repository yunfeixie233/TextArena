The most popular first moves often involve the pawns in front of the King and Queen, as well as developing the Knights.\n\nLet's develop the Knight to a good square. [b1c3] is a valid move as it develops the Knight toward the center. However, one of the most favored opening moves involves playing [e2e4], which opens up the center and allows for quick development of other pieces.\n\nConsidering the options and focusing on a solid, central presence, I decide to play [e2e4].
