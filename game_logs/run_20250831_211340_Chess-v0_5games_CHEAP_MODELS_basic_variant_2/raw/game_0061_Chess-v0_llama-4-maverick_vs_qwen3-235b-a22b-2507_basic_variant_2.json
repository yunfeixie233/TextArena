Since White\u2019s queen is on d1, capturing the knight on e4 would expose the queen to a discovered attack from Black\u2019s d7-d5 (if played) or allow material loss after recapture. This allows Black to win a pawn cleanly or gain superior positioning. The move ...Nxe4 is a strong centralizing response, increasing pressure in the heart of the board and preparing for rapid development and potential kingside castling.\n\nThe chosen move is: [f6e4]\n[GAME] Player 1 made the following move: f6e4\n[GAME] Current board:\n   +-----------------+\n 8 | r n b q k b . r |\n 7 | p p . p . p p p |\n 6 | . . . . . . . . |\n 5 | . . . . p . . . |\n 4 | . . .

It also prepares for potential kingside castling while maintaining flexibility in the center. By positioning the queen actively, Black enhances coordination and threatens tactical ideas involving the c-file or a future ...d5 break.
