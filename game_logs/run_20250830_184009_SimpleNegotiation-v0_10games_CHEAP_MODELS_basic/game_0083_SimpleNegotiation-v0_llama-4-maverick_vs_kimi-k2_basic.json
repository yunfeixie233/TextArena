      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I should analyze the current values and quantities of the resources I have and consider potential trades that could increase my total value.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of my current resources:\n- Wheat: 14 * 6 = 84\n- Wood: 10 * 11 = 110\n- Sheep: 25 * 15 = 375\n- Brick: 13 * 25 = 325\n- Ore: 9 * 37 = 333\n\nTotal value = 84 + 110 + 375 + 325 + 333 = 1227\n\nTo increase this total value, I should look for opportunities to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or to negotiate trades that result in a net gain in value.\n\nLet's analyze the potential trades:\n1. **Trading away Wheat (Value: 6)**: Since Wheat has the lowest value among my resources, trading it away for any other resource could be beneficial if I get a quantity that compensates for its low value.\n   \n2. **Trading away Wood (Value: 11)**: Wood is the second-lowest in value. Trading it for resources with higher values could be beneficial.\n\nLet's consider making an initial offer to start the negotiation. Since Ore has a high value and I have a relatively small quantity of it, I might want to conserve it. However, I also have a significant number of Sheep, and Brick is quite valuable.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of my Sheep (Value: 15) for more valuable resources or for resources that I can later trade for something more valuable. \n\nFor my first turn, I'll make an offer to trade some Wheat (the lowest value resource) for Wood (since it's the next lowest in value but still more valuable than Wheat), to see if my opponent is interested in such a trade. This could be a preliminary step to more strategic trades.\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Wood]' \n\nThis is my action for Turn 1. Let's see the opponent's response.",

Considering the resources we have, offering some Wheat (since we have a decent amount but it's the least valuable) or Sheep (since we have a lot) could be reasonable.\n\n- **Proposed Trade:** `[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n  - We're offering 4 Sheep (4*15 = 60 value) and 2 Wheat (2*6 = 12 value), totaling 72 value, for 1 Ore (1*37 = 37 value).\n  - This isn't a great trade for us value-wise, as we're giving up more value than we're getting.\n\nLet's reconsider and think about a better trade.\n\n- **Alternative Trade:** `[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n  - We're offering 2 Wood (2*11 = 22 value) for 1 Brick (1*25 = 25 value).\n  - This trade slightly increases our value.\n\nLet's go with a revised, more balanced trade offer.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n\nLet's wait for Player 1's response.",
