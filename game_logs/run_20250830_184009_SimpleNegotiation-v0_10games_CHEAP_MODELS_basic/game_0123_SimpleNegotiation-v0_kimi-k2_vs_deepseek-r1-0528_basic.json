      "response": "As Player 1, I need to increase the total value of my resources through strategic trades. I currently have the following resources with my personal valuations:\n- Wheat (17 units, value 5 each): Total value 85\n- Wood (10 units, value 8 each): Total value 80\n- Sheep (20 units, value 18 each): Total value 360\n- Brick (25 units, value 21 each): Total value 525\n- Ore (5 units, value 33 each): Total value 165\nCombined total value: **1,215**.\n\nMy key observations:\n- Brick and Sheep are abundant but high-value (21 and 18 per unit). Trading them risks losing value unless compensated with higher-value resources.\n- Ore is my highest-value resource (33 per unit), but I only have 5 units. Acquiring more Ore would significantly boost my total value.\n- Wheat and Wood are lower-value (5 and 8 per unit), but trading them away for Ore could yield gains if the exchange rate is favorable.\n- Proposed trade must result in a net gain in *my* valuation, regardless of the opponent's valuation.\n\nAfter calculating options:\n- Trading low-value resources (Wheat/Wood) for Ore is ideal, but hard to balance without knowing opponent's needs.\n- Trading Brick for Ore could work at a ratio that gives me a net gain. For example:\n  - Offering 3 Brick (my value: 63) for 2 Ore (their value: 66) gives me a **+3 gain**.\n- This offer might appeal to an opponent who values Brick more highly or has excess Ore.\n\n**Offer Details**:\n- **My offer**: Give 3 Brick, receive 2 Ore.\n- **My valuation**: I lose 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 value but gain 2 \u00d7 33 = 66 value, for a net gain of +3.\n- **Format**: `[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]`\n\nThis is a conservative opening move to test the opponent while ensuring potential value growth.
