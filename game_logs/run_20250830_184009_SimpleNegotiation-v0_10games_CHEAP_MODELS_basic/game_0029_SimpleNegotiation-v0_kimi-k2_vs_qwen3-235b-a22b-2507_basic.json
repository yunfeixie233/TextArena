      "response": "Alright, let's take a step back and think strategically. After three unsuccessful offers, it's clear that Player 1 isn't interested in the deals I'm proposing. From their rejections, it seems like they might value certain resources differently or have specific needs that my offers aren't meeting.\n\nLooking at my resources:\n- Wheat: 21 (value 6)\n- Wood: 18 (value 9)\n- Sheep: 18 (value 14)\n- Brick: 20 (value 22)\n- Ore: 14 (value 40)\n\nFrom the previous attempts, my offers have been:\n1. 5 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore + 2 Brick\n   - My offered value: (5*6) + (3*9) = 30 + 27 = 57\n   - My requested value: (1*40) + (2*22) = 40 + 44 = 84\n   - This was a bad deal for me, offering much more value than requesting.\n\n2. 4 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore + 1 Brick\n   - My offered value: 4*14 = 56\n   - My requested value: 40 + 22 = 62\n   - Still slightly unfavorable to me.\n\n3. 3 Sheep + 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 1 Sheep\n   - My offered value: (3*14) + (2*40) = 42 + 80 = 122\n   - My requested value: (5*22) + 14 = 110 + 14 = 124\n   - Almost even value exchange, but Player 1 still rejected it.\n\nGiven these rejections, perhaps Player 1 values Ore very highly (more than 40) or doesn't value Sheep/Brick as much as I do. To make progress, I need to adjust my offers to either:\n- Give more value to Player 1 (make the deal sweeter for them)\n- Ask for less in exchange\n- Offer resources that Player 1 might value more (though I don't have much info on their preferences)\n\nLet me try offering a deal that gives more value to Player 1, perhaps overpaying slightly to make it attractive.\n\nProposal:\nI currently have excess Wheat and Wood (both lower value), and I'm short on Ore. Maybe Player 1 needs Wheat or Wood more than I think. I'll propose a deal where I give more of my \"cheap\" resources in exchange for Ore.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Ore, 2 Brick]",
