Player 1 made no new offer.\n\nMy previous offer was [Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick].\nValue offered: (2 * 11) + (2 * 5) = 22 + 10 = 32\nValue requested: 1 * 28 = 28\nThis was actually a loss for me. I should be more careful to ensure the value requested is greater than the value offered.\n\nI have a large quantity of Brick and Wheat, and a low quantity of Ore. Ore is also my highest value resource. I should try to trade for more Ore or other high-value resources like Brick or Sheep, giving away Wheat or Wood.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat for Ore.\nValue of 1 Ore = 36.\nValue of 1 Wheat = 5.\nI would need to offer 8 Wheat to match the value of 1 Ore (8 * 5 = 40). This would be a good trade for me, exchanging 40 value for 36 value.\n\nLet's consider trading Wood.\nValue of 1 Wood = 11.\nI could offer 3 Wood (3 * 11 = 33) for 1 Ore. This is closer to even value.\n\nI have an abundance of Brick. Is there anything I want to trade away for it? No. Brick is high value. I want more of it.\n\nGiven my low quantity of Ore, I will prioritize acquiring it.\nLet's make an offer where I gain value.\n\nOption 1: Trade Wheat for Ore.\nOffer 7 Wheat (7 * 5 = 35) for 1 Ore (36). This would be a net gain of 1 value. And it helps me reduce excess Wheat while gaining scarce, high-value Ore.\n\nOption 2: Trade Wood for Ore.\nOffer 3 Wood (3 * 11 = 33) for 1 Ore (36). This would be a net gain of 3 value. I have 12 Wood, so this is sustainable.\n\nOption 3: Trade Wheat for Brick.\nOffer 5 Wheat (5 * 5 = 25) for 1 Brick (28). Net gain of 3.\n\nI will try to make an attractive offer where I gain a reasonable amount of value.\nI have a significant amount of Wheat. I will offer Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
