      "response": "I have received an offer from Player 0: \"Offered items: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> Requested items: 3 Ore\".\n\nLet's analyze the value of this trade for me (Player 1).\n\n**Player 0's Offer (to me):**\n*   **Incoming:**\n    *   10 Wheat (Value: 5 each) = 10 * 5 = 50\n    *   5 Wood (Value: 10 each) = 5 * 10 = 50\n    *   **Total Incoming Value = 100**\n*   **Outgoing:**\n    *   3 Ore (Value: 39 each) = 3 * 39 = 117\n    *   **Total Outgoing Value = 117**\n\n**Net Change for me if I accept:** 100 (incoming) - 117 (outgoing) = -17.\n\nThis offer would decrease the total value of my resources. Therefore, I will deny this offer.\n\nNow, let's consider a counter-offer that would increase my total value.\n\nMy current resources and values are:\n*   Wheat: 18 (Value: 5)\n*   Wood: 12 (Value: 10)\n*   Sheep: 9 (Value: 12)\n*   Brick: 18 (Value: 24)\n*   Ore: 19 (Value: 39)\n\nI have a lot of Brick and Ore, which are high-value items, and a fair amount of Wheat and Wood. My Sheep quantity is relatively low among my high-value items.\n\nPlayer 0 seems to be looking for Ore, as their offer requested it. I have 19 Ore, which is a good amount.\n\nI want to get resources that I'm relatively low on (like Sheep), or resources that are cheap for me to acquire and can be traded up later, while shedding some of my abundant high-value resources for a net gain.\n\nLet's try to offer some of my Brick and Ore (which I have in good quantity) in exchange for Sheep and/or Wood/Wheat. My current offer will be designed to increase my total resource value.\n\nConsider offering 1 Ore (Value 39) for 3 Sheep (3 * 12 = 36). This is a slight loss for me, so not good on its own.\n\nHow about offering some Brick, which I have a lot of (18).\nIf I offer 1 Brick (Value 24) for 2 Wood (2 * 10 = 20), it's a loss.\nIf I offer 1 Brick (Value 24) for 2 Sheep (2 * 12 = 24), this is a fair trade.\n\nLet's build an offer where I aim for a positive value trade.\n\nProposed Offer:\n*   **Offered by me:** 1 Ore (Value 39) + 2 Brick (Value 2 * 24 = 48) = 87\n*   **Requested by me:** 2 Sheep (Value 2 * 12 = 24) + 1 Wood (Value 10) + 7 Wheat (Value 7 * 5 = 35) = 69 (Still a loss if I use these numbers).\n\nI need to make sure the value I request is higher than the value I offer.\n\nLet's try to get more Sheep, as they are moderately valuable and I have fewer of them.\n\nConsider giving up a high-value item for multiple lower-value, but still useful, items.\n\nOffer: 2 Ore (Value: 2 * 39 = 78)\nRequest: 3 Sheep (Value: 3 * 12 = 36) + 3 Wood (Value: 3 * 10 = 30) = 66. This is a loss for me.\n\nI need to be more aggressive in requesting value.\n\nLet's assume Player 0 might need Brick or Ore, given their previous request for Ore.\n\nMy Offer:\n*   Offer: 1 Ore (Value 39)\n*   Request: 2 Sheep (Value 24) + 1 Wood (Value 10) + 1 Wheat (Value 5) = 39. This is an even trade. I want to win.\n\nLet's make Player 0 pay a little more for my Ore.\n\nOffer: 1 Ore (Value 39)\nRequest: 2 Sheep (Value 24) + 2 Wood (Value 20) = 44.\nNet gain for me: 44 - 39 = 5.\nThis is a small but positive gain for me. I have 19 Ore, so giving up 1 is fine if it increases my value. I gain Sheep and Wood, which are useful.\n\nLet's try this.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep, 2 Wood]",
