To increase the total value, we need to think about what we can offer that is less valuable to us than what we receive.\n\nConsidering our resources and values, a potential trade could involve offering resources that are less valuable to us in exchange for more valuable ones.\n\nLet's think about an alternative offer. \n\nIf I offer 2 Sheep and 1 Ore (total value = 2*15 + 1*32 = 62), I could ask for Brick (value = 23 each). To match or exceed the value of what I'm offering, I would need at least 3 Brick (since 62 / 23 \u2248 2.7, so we need at least 3 Brick).\n\nThus, a potential offer could be: `[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]`.\n\nLet's check:\n- You give away: 2 Sheep (value: 15 each) and 1 Ore (value: 32) = 30 + 32 = 62\n- You receive: 3 Brick (value: 23 each) = 69\n\nThis seems like a positive trade (net gain = 69 - 62 = +7).\n\nSo, my action is: `[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]`.",

A potential trade could be offering Wheat for a resource that is more valuable.\n\n## Step 7: Decide on a specific trade offer.\nOffering 4 Wheat for 1 Ore could be a good start since Ore is highly valued (32) compared to Wheat (6).
