I have a significant amount of Ore and Brick, which are high-value resources. Trading away some of the lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood) or even Sheep for more Brick or Ore could be beneficial.\n\n2. Since Ore is the most valuable, I should prioritize not trading it away unless it's for a resource of higher total value.\n\nLet's consider an initial offer that could potentially increase my total value. I have Wheat (Value: 5) and Wood (Value: 9), which are relatively low in value. I can try to trade some of these for resources that are more valuable.\n\nFor Turn 1, I'll offer to trade some of my lower-value resources. I have 16 Wheat, so I can afford to give away some.

Player 0's last offer (2 Ore for 2 Brick) is quite beneficial considering Brick's higher value.\n2. Player 0 has previously accepted trades that increased their resource value.\n\n### Making a New Offer:\nConsidering that I want to enhance my position while taking advantage of the higher-value resources available, I'll look to capitalize on my current Brick and Ore quantities.\n\nI will now make a trade offer to Player 0:\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 3 Ore]",

      "response": "Since the current turn is the 9th turn, I will carefully examine the current resources and the last offer made by Player 1.\n\nThe current resources and associated values I have are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 11   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 6    Value: 9\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 6    Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 11   Value: 26\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 9    Value: 33\n\nThe last offer made by Player 1 was: Offered items: 2 Brick -> Requested items: 3 Ore.\n\nLet's evaluate this offer:\n- I have 9 Ore and I will give away 3 Ore, so I will be left with 6 Ore. The total value of Ore I have will change from 9 * 33 = 297 to 6 * 33 = 198, which is a decrease of 99.\n- I have 11 Brick and I will receive 2 Brick, so I will have 13 Brick. The total value of Brick I have will change from 11 * 26 = 286 to 13 * 26 = 338, which is an increase of 52.\n\nThe total value change will be -99 + 52 = -47. This is not a good trade for me.\n\nHowever, considering it's almost the end of the game and no better offer has been made, I will make a counteroffer instead of accepting or denying this one directly.\n\nLet's analyze my resources again and think about what I can offer that might be beneficial for both of us.\n\nI will make a new offer: [Offer: 3 Ore -> 3 Brick].\n\nThis translates to: [Offer: 3 Ore -> 3 Brick].\n\nLet's calculate the change:\n- I will give away 3 Ore (Value: 33), so the total value change for Ore will be -3 * 33 = -99.\n- I will receive 3 Brick (Value: 26), so the total value change for Brick will be 3 * 26 = 78.\n\nThe total value change will be -99 + 78 = -21. This is still not a very good trade but is slightly better than the previous one.\n\nMy response will be: [Offer: 3 Ore -> 3 Brick].",
