Brick (20) is medium-value but I have a large quantity (24), so I can potentially trade it for higher-value resources. To maximize value, I should aim to trade away low/medium-value resources for high-value ones, starting with the most lopsided opportunities in my favor.\n\nI notice that trading 1 Brick (value 20) for 1 Ore (value 34) would give me a net gain of +14 per trade. This is a strong starting offer because:\n- It leverages my Brick surplus.\n- An acceptance would immediately boost my value.\n- Even if rejected, it tests the opponent's valuation of Ore vs. Brick for future negotiations.\n\nThus, my first offer is:  \n**[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]**  \n\nIf accepted, I'll re-evaluate for the next turn. If rejected, I'll consider adjusting my offer based on feedback or try other combinations (e.g., using Wood/Wheat for Sheep/Ore). Let's see how the opponent responds!",
