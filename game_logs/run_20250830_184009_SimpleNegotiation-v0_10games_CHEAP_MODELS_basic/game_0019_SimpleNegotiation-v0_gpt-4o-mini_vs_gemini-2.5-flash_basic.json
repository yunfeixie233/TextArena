I have a lot of Ore (23), so I can afford to trade some. My Brick quantity (9) is lower.\nI have a good quantity of Wood (21) and Sheep (10), which are lower value. Wheat (8) is also low value for me.\n\nMy goal is to increase my total value.\n\nLet's propose an exchange that increases my value. I'll offer some Sheep and Wheat for some Brick and Ore.\nOr I can offer some of my valuable Ore if I get something even more valuable in return, or a large quantity of something else.\n\nConsider the last proposal from Player 0: 6 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 3 Brick, 3 Ore.\nThey want Brick and Ore. I want to increase my value.\n\nIf I give 3 Ore (120 value) and get 3 Brick (66 value), it's a loss. I need more.\n\nLet's make an offer where I give resources of lower value, and get resources of higher value.\nI have 21 Wood (value 10), 8 Wheat (value 6), 10 Sheep (value 18).\nI want more Brick (value 22) and Ore (value 40).\n\nLet's try offering: 5 Wood, 5 Sheep\nValue offered: (5 * 10) + (5 * 18) = 50 + 90 = 140\n\nI would like more Brick and Ore.\nLet's ask for: 2 Brick, 2 Ore\nValue requested: (2 * 22) + (2 * 40) = 44 + 80 = 124\n\nThis is not good for me either. 140 offered, 124 requested.\n\nLet's consider the previous trade where Player 0 offered: 4 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 4 Brick, 1 Wood.\nValue offered by P0: (4*18) + (1*40) = 72 + 40 = 112\nValue requested by P0: (4*22) + (1*10) = 88 + 10 = 98\n\nThis was also P0 taking a loss, but I rejected it.\n\nLet's focus on my resources. I want to trade Wood and Sheep for Brick and Ore.\nI have 21 Wood and 10 Sheep.\nI also have 8 Wheat.\n\nLet's offer some lower value resources, for a higher value one.\n[Offer: 6 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (6 * 18) + (2 * 10) = 108 + 20 = 128\nValue requested: (2 * 22) + (1 * 40) = 44 + 40 = 84 (Still not good for me)\n\nI need to make sure my requested value is HIGHER than my offered value.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Player 0's last offer: 6 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 3 Brick, 3 Ore.\nValue given by P0 (6 Sheep, 1 Wood): (6*18) + (1*10) = 108 + 10 = 118\nValue gained by P0 (3 Brick, 3 Ore): (3*22) + (3*40) = 66 + 120 = 186\nThis offer would result in a gain of 186 - 118 = 68 for Player 0 if I accepted it.\nI gain -68, so I reject.\n\nI need to create an offer that gains me value.\nHow about offering some Ore (my most valuable asset), but getting a lot in return?\nOr offering my low value goods for high value goods.\n\nI have 8 Wheat (value 6). This is my lowest value item.\nI have 21 Wood (value 10).\nI have 10 Sheep (value 18).\n\nPlayer 0 wants Brick and Ore.\nWhat if I offer a lot of my lower value items for some of their higher value items?\n\n[Offer: 10 Sheep, 5 Wood -> 3 Brick, 2 Ore]\nValue offered: (10 * 18) + (5 * 10) = 180 + 50 = 230\nValue requested: (3 * 22) + (2 * 40) = 66 + 80 = 146 (still bad for me)\n\nLet's try to get a better deal for Ore specifically.\n[Offer: 6 Sheep, 6 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]\n\nValue offered: (6 * 18) + (6 * 10) = 108 + 60 = 168\nValue requested: (2 * 40) + (1 * 22) = 80 + 22 = 102\n\nThis is still a loss for me. I need the requested items to be of higher value.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (5 * 10) + (5 * 6) = 50 + 30 = 80\nValue requested: (1 * 22) + (1 * 40) = 22 + 40 = 62 (still a loss)\n\nWhat if I offer one of my Ore (value 40) for something more valuable or a combination of valuable items?\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 2 Sheep]\nValue offered: 40\nValue requested: (1 * 22) + (2 * 18) = 22 + 36 = 58 (Gain of 18)\nThis looks like a good starting point for me.
