Here's my analysis:\n\n- My current Brick (13 units at 20 value each) is valuable, but your offer of 3 Sheep (18 value each) and 5 Wood (12 value each) gives me a net gain in total value:\n  - I give: 5 Brick \u00d7 20 = 100 value\n  - I get: (3 Sheep \u00d7 18) + (5 Wood \u00d7 12) = 54 + 60 = 114 value\n  - Net gain: 114 - 100 = +14 value\n\nThis trade moderately increases my total value, and since I have sufficient Brick reserves (13 > 5) and can accommodate more Wood despite already having a surplus (19 units), I find this acceptable for now. However, going forward, I prefer trades involving high-value resources like Ore or Brick and may look to offload excess Wood or Wheat.\n\n**[Accept]**",
