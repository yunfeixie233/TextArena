      "response": "Let\u2019s first compute the current total value of everything you hold:\n\n- Wheat: 17 \u00d7 5 = 85  \n- Wood: 20 \u00d7 10 = 200  \n- Sheep: 10 \u00d7 14 = 140  \n- Brick: 16 \u00d7 26 = 416  \n- Ore: 14 \u00d7 33 = 462  \n\nTotal value = 85 + 200 + 140 + 416 + 462 = 1 303.\n\nGoal: after every trade your new total value must be strictly larger than 1 303, and we must always finish the trade with non-negative quantities (no IOUs).\n\nThe single most-overvalued item you own (from your own private valuation table) is __Ore__ (33 per unit); the single most-undervalued item you have is __Wheat__ (5 per unit).  \nHence we are very happy to *dump* Wheat and very happy to *acquire* Ore, Brick or Sheep (which we internally value at 26 and 14 respectively). Wood is neutral-ish at 10.\n\nBecause I play second, I first see your turn-1 message before I can make any offer.\n\nFor the moment I will prepare what I would like to propose in general terms once it becomes my turn:\n\n\u2022 I am willing to give away: Wheat (clearly low value to me), and perhaps a *small* amount of Wood.  \n\u2022 I am eager to receive: Brick (26) and/or Ore (33).  \n\u2022 I will **never** accept an offer that asks me to give away Brick or Ore unless the incoming value is dramatically higher, because those two resources are my \u201ctop-heavy\u201d ones.\n\nExample of a value-creating trade for me:  \nFor each 1 Ore (value 33 to me) I\u2019m delighted to part with as many as **six Wheat** (6 \u00d7 5 = 30) and still be up by 3 points. However a 6-for-1 ratio looks greedy. A cleaner socially-acceptable ratio is 4-to-5 Wheat per Ore or Brick.\n\nTherefore, one specific offer I am ready to make once it is my turn:\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]      //  I value outgoing 5 Wheat at 25, incoming Brick at 26 \u2192 gain of +1  \n\u2026or\u2026  \n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]        //  gain of +8  \n\u2026or a slightly sweetened bundle\u2026  \n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]  // out: 5\u00d75 + 2\u00d710 = 45, in: 33 + 26 = 59 \u2192 gain of +14\n\nThese template offers are all value-positive for me and keep the numbers small and palatable for the opponent to accept.\n\nMAX length to 100 tokens:\n\nSTART Negotiation game, I\u2019m Player 0.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
