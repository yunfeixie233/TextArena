      "response": "The game has already started.  You are Player 0.\n\nYour current resources and values are:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 14 Value: 5\n*   [Wood] Qty: 13 Value: 8\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 9 Value: 13\n*   [Brick] Qty: 13 Value: 27\n*   [Ore] Qty: 7 Value: 35\n\nPlayer 1 rejected your last offer (5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick). They also didn't make a new counter-offer. This suggests they found your offer unfavorable for them or that they don't value Brick as highly as you do for the given exchange.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Your previous offer of 5 Wheat (value 25) and 3 Wood (value 24) for a total of 49 value was for 1 Brick (value 27). This was a bad deal for you, as you'd lose 22 net value for this trade. You were likely trying to acquire Brick, but the amount offered was disproportionate.\n\nSince Player 1 didn't counter-offer, they might not be interested in Wheat or Wood, or they are, but not at those quantities.\n\nYou have a lot of Wheat and Wood. It's often good to trade excess cheaper resources for scarcer, more valuable ones.\n\nLet's try to get more valuable resources like Ore or Brick, which you have fewer of and are very valuable, or even Sheep which are moderately valuable.\n\n**Option 1: Try for Ore or Brick again, but with a more balanced offer.**\n*   You want more valuable resources.\n\n**Option 2: Try to trade for Sheep.**\n*   Sheep are good. You have 9, but if you can get more cheaply, it's not bad.\n\nLet's think about a new offer.\n*   You have 14 Wheat (value 5) and 13 Wood (value 8).\n*   You are relatively low on Ore (7) and Brick (13), which are very high value.\n*   Sheep are 13 value, so they're in the middle.\n\nLet's try to get something more valuable, perhaps some Ore, which is your most valuable resource. What could you offer for 1 Ore? Value 35.\n\n*   You could offer some Wheat or Wood.\n    *   7 Wheat = 35 value (even trade, if they need Wheat)\n    *   4 Wood = 32 value (slightly less, but good for you)\n    *   Combination: 3 Wheat (15) + 2 Wood (16) = 31 value. This is a bit less than one Ore.\n\nYou rejected the offer of 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick. This was a good move.\n\nSince Player 1 rejected your last offer and didn't propose one, they probably didn't find value in your offer for them. You need to create an offer that is appealing to them, while still increasing your overall value.\n\nWhat if we try to get more high-value resources, like Ore or Brick, but offer less of your overall value? You have a lot of Wheat and Wood, which are low value.\n\nLet's try to trade a significant amount of Wheat and Wood for some high-value Brick or Ore.\n\nConsider targeting **Ore** first, as it's the highest value.\nWhat about offering a large quantity of low-value items for one high-value item?\n\nLet's try:\n**Offer: 8 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Ore**\n*   8 Wheat = 8 * 5 = 40 value\n*   5 Wood = 5 * 8 = 40 value\n*   Total Offered Value = 80\n*   1 Ore = 35 value\n\nThis is offering way too much value (80) for 1 Ore (35). This is a bad trade for you. You need to make a good trade *for you*.\n\nLet's try to get Brick.\n**Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick** was rejected. (49 value for 27 value)\n\nWhat if we try to gain Sheep? You have 9, and they are 13 value.\nCould you trade 2 Wood for 1 Sheep?\n*   2 Wood = 16 value (for you)\n*   1 Sheep = 13 value (for them)\nThis is a small loss for you.\n\nLet's try to trade for something where you have fewer on hand. Brick (13) and Ore (7). Ore is the most valuable.\n\nLet's try to get **Ore**.\nYou want to offer something that is low value to you, but potentially high value to Player 1.\nIf 1 Ore is 35.\nWhat if we offer: 2 Sheep (26 value)? Not enough.\nWhat if we offer: 1 Sheep (13) and some Wheat/Wood?\n\nLet's try to be more strategic. You have a lot of cheap resources. You should try to convert them into higher-value resources.\n\nThink about the trade ratio:\n1 Ore (35) is roughly equal to:\n*   7 Wheat (35)\n*   4-5 Wood (32-40)\n*   2-3 Sheep (26-39)\n*   1-2 Brick (27-54)\n\nYou want to make a deal where the value you *receive* is greater than the value you *give*.\n\nLet's try to offer a small amount of value for a bigger amount.\nPlayer 1 rejected the previous offer. Maybe they don't want Wheat or Wood?\n\nLet's try to get more **Brick**. You have 13, and it's 27 value.\nTry to offer something like:\n*   3 Sheep (39 value) for 2 Brick (54 value)? Good for you.\n*   2 Sheep (26 value) for 1 Brick (27 value)? Very close to even. Good.\n\nWhat about trying to get more Sheep? You have 9.\nOffer some Wheat and Wood for Sheep.\n**Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep**\n*   3 Wheat = 15 value\n*   2 Wood = 16 value\n*   Total Offered = 31 value\n*   1 Sheep = 13 value\nThis is bad for you. Don't do this.\n\nYou rejected their last offer. Now it's your turn to make a new offer.\n\nWhat if we offer some of our higher-value resources for a larger *quantity* of other higher-value resources?\nFor example, trade 1 Ore (35) for 2 Brick (54)? Good for you. But do you want to give up an Ore? You only have 7.\n\nLet's try to get more of the high-value resources while giving away a fair amount of the low-value.\n\nLet's try to target **Brick**. You have 13, value 27.\nHow about offering a combined value from Wheat and Wood that is slightly less than a Brick, but could be appealing?\nIf 1 Brick = 27 value.\n\nTry to offer:\n*   3 Wheat (15) + 1 Wood (8) = 23 value for 1 Brick (27 value)? This is good for you.\n*   4 Wheat (20) + 1 Wood (8) = 28 value for 1 Brick (27 value)? This is slightly bad for you.\n\nLet's try for a small win.\n**Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick**\nYour Offered Value: (3 * 5) + (1 * 8) = 15 + 8 = 23\nYour Requested Value: 1 * 27 = 27\nNet gain for you: 4 value.\n\nThis is a good offer for you. It's also possible Player 1 might accept it if they need Wheat or Wood and don't value Brick as highly.\nIt's a reasonable offer.\n\nLet's propose this.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
