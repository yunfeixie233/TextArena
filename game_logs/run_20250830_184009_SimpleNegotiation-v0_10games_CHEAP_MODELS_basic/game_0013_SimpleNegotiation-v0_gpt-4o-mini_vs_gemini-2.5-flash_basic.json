      "response": "In the Negotiation Game so far, here's the overview of Player 0's actions and the current resources after the trades:\n\n### Current Resources\n1. **Wheat**: 16 - (0 traded)\n2. **Wood**: 16 - (4 traded)\n3. **Sheep**: 10 - (3 traded, gained 2 Sheep)\n4. **Brick**: 8 + (5 gained from the trade with Player 1)\n5. **Ore**: 20 - (2 traded, gained 2 Ore)\n\n### Resource Summary After Trades\n- **Wheat**: 16\n- **Wood**: 12 (16 - 4)\n- **Sheep**: 9 (10 - 3 + 2 from trade)\n- **Brick**: 13 (8 + 5 from trade)\n- **Ore**: 20 (20 - 2 + 2 from trade)\n\n### Value Assessment\n- Value of current resources:\n  - Wheat: 16 * 5 = 80\n  - Wood: 12 * 8 = 96\n  - Sheep: 9 * 18 = 162\n  - Brick: 13 * 28 = 364\n  - Ore: 20 * 37 = 740\n\n**Total Value = 80 + 96 + 162 + 364 + 740 = 1442**\n\n### Next Steps\nSince Player 1 is now unwilling to engage in trades that are beneficial for Player 0, it may be wiser to reassess the trade offers to either offer more value to Player 1 or seek alternate resources. The goal is to propose a trade that could enhance the total value of resources further. \n\nI would like to make an offer to Player 1 that includes valuable, easier-to-trade resources. \n\n### Proposed Trade Offer\n**Offer**: \n- **Offered items**: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat \n- **Requested items**: 4 Brick, 3 Ore\n\n**Trade Proposal**: \n`[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 4 Brick, 3 Ore]` \n\nI will now send this trade offer to Player 1.",
