I\u2019d like to accumulate more, not lose any.  \n- Wheat is my lowest-value-per-unit resource (6). I have a surplus of it, so I\u2019m willing to part with it cheaply.  \n- Last turn I offered 5 Wheat for 2 Sheep (a 30-point offer vs 32-point return) to move value upward, but it was refused.  \n  That either means the opponent thinks 5 Wheat is simply not valuable enough, or they don\u2019t want/need Wheat at all.\n\nRe-plan  \nSince Wheat has been refused once, repeating the same ratio is unlikely to succeed.  \nI need to decide whether to (1) raise my offer of Wheat, (2) offer different resources, or (3) switch roles and ask what they want.\n\nBecause Wheat remains low-value to me, I\u2019ll try a more generous ratio first: 7 Wheat for 2 Sheep.  \nThat is still a tidy value gain for me (42 \u2192 32 = 10-point arbitrage) and looks generous to them.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]",
