      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0, I start by analyzing my current resources and their values:\n- Wheat: Qty: 16, Value: 6\n- Wood: Qty: 25, Value: 12\n- Sheep: Qty: 7, Value: 15\n- Brick: Qty: 8, Value: 24\n- Ore: Qty: 14, Value: 38\n\nThe total value of my resources is calculated as follows:\n- Wheat: 16 * 6 = 96\n- Wood: 25 * 12 = 300\n- Sheep: 7 * 15 = 105\n- Brick: 8 * 24 = 192\n- Ore: 14 * 38 = 532\n- Total Value = 96 + 300 + 105 + 192 + 532 = 1225\n\n### Negotiation Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I need to strategically decide which resources to offer and which to request. The value of resources can guide this decision. I should aim to acquire resources with higher values if possible.\n\n### Initial Offer\n\nLet's examine potential trades. One strategy is to offer resources with lower values in exchange for resources with higher values. For instance, I could offer some Wheat (Value: 6) or Wood (Value: 12) for resources like Brick (Value: 24) or Ore (Value: 38).\n\nConsidering my resources, I have a relatively high quantity of Wood (Value: 12) compared to other resources. I could offer some Wood in exchange for a resource with a higher value.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nI will offer 10 Wood (Value: 12) in exchange for 4 Brick (Value: 24). The calculation is as follows:\n- Offering 10 Wood = 10 * 12 = 120 value\n- Requesting 4 Brick = 4 * 24 = 96 value\n\nAlthough this trade seems not to increase my total value directly (since 120 > 96), it's a starting point. However, upon closer inspection, this trade isn't favorable.\n\nLet's consider a more favorable trade: Offering Wheat (lower value) for Brick or Ore (higher values).\n\n### Alternative Trade Offer\n\nI could offer 8 Wheat (Value: 6) for 2 Ore (Value: 38).\n- Offering 8 Wheat = 8 * 6 = 48 value\n- Requesting 2 Ore = 2 * 38 = 76 value\n\nThis trade is more promising since I'm gaining more value than I'm giving away (76 > 48).\n\n### Action\n\nI will make the following offer: `[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Ore]`\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.\n\n### Next Step\n\nAfter making the offer, I will wait for the opponent's response. If they accept, I will receive 2 Ore and give away 8 Wheat. If they deny, I will need to reassess and potentially make a new offer.\n\nSince this is the first turn, I will proceed with my initial offer.\n\n`[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Ore]`",

This trade increased the total value of resources because the value of 1 Ore (38) is greater than the value of 5 Wood (5 * 12 = 60), actually, it is not, it decreased the total value. However, we still need to continue the game to see if we can make better trades.\n\nLet's evaluate the current resources and think about a potential next trade.\n\n### Total Value Calculation\n\nBefore the last trade:\n- Total Value = (16 * 6) + (25 * 12) + (7 * 15) + (8 * 24) + (14 * 38)\n- Total Value = 96 + 300 + 105 + 192 + 532 = 1225\n\nAfter the last trade:\n- Total Value = (16 * 6) + (20 * 12) + (7 * 15) + (8 * 24) + (15 * 38)\n- Total Value = 96 + 240 + 105 + 192 + 570 = 1203\n\n### Next Action\n\nTo improve the total value, we should consider making a trade that gives us more valuable resources or removing less valuable ones. Given the current state, one possible strategy is to try to get rid of lower-value resources and gain higher-value ones.\n\nLet's think about a trade offer. We can offer some Wheat (Value: 6) or Wood (Value: 12) to get more valuable resources like Ore (Value: 38), Brick (Value: 24), or Sheep (Value: 15).\n\nProposing a new trade:\nSince Wheat is one of the least valuable resources, we could offer some Wheat in exchange for something more valuable.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\n`[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis trade involves giving away 8 Wheat (8 * 6 = 48 in value) for 1 Brick (24 in value). This is not a good trade as it decreases our total value.\n\nLet's think of a better trade.\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis trade involves giving away 4 Wheat (4 * 6 = 24) and 2 Wood (2 * 12 = 24), totaling 48 in value, for 1 Ore (38 in value). This is still not a good trade.\n\nLet's consider another option.\n\n`[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]`\n\nThis involves giving away 3 Sheep (3 * 15 = 45) for 2 Ore (2 * 38 = 76). This trade seems beneficial as we gain more value than we give away.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]`\n\nLet's wait for Player 1's response.",

Let's analyze the values:\n\n1. **Identify Valuable Trades**: We should aim to get resources with higher values or quantities that can significantly increase our total value.\n   \n2. **Available Resources**: We have Wheat (Value: 6), Wood (Value: 12), Sheep (Value: 15), Brick (Value: 24), and Ore (Value: 38).\n\n3. **Potential Trades**:\n   - We can offer resources like Wheat or Wood (lower value) to get more valuable resources like Brick or Ore.\n   - Since we already have a good quantity of Ore, let's focus on acquiring more Brick or Sheep if possible, as they are relatively valuable.\n\n4. **Proposed Trade**:\n   - Offer: **[Offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Brick]**. This trade involves giving away 4 Wood (Value: 12 * 4 = 48) to gain 2 Brick (Value: 24 * 2 = 48). The value is equivalent, but it doesn't decrease our total value.

Here, we're offering (7*6) + (2*12) = 42 + 24 = 66 value for 3 Sheep (3*15 = 45 value). This isn't a good trade as it reduces our total value.\n\nLet's think of another trade:\n- We can offer some Wheat for Brick since Brick is more valuable than Wheat.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nLet's propose: **[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick]**.\n\nThis involves giving away 6 Wheat (6*6 = 36) to get 1 Brick (1*24 = 24).

      "response": "### Current State Analysis\nThe current state of resources for Player 0 is as follows:\n- Wheat: 16 - 8 = 8 (since 8 Wheat was offered and not accepted)\n- Wood: 25 - 5 + 0 = 20 (since 5 Wood was traded for 1 Ore)\n- Sheep: 7 - 2 = 5 (since 2 Sheep was offered and not accepted)\n- Brick: 8 + 0 = 8 (since no Brick was received or offered successfully)\n- Ore: 14 + 1 = 15 (since 1 Ore was received from trading 5 Wood)\n\nLet's update the values:\n- Wheat: 8 * 6 = 48\n- Wood: 20 * 12 = 240\n- Sheep: 5 * 15 = 75\n- Brick: 8 * 24 = 192\n- Ore: 15 * 38 = 570\nTotal value = 48 + 240 + 75 + 192 + 570 = 1125\n\n### Game History and Next Steps\n1. Previous offers were either rejected or not responded with a counteroffer from Player 1.\n2. The last accepted trade was 5 Wood for 1 Ore, which was beneficial as it increased the total value.\n\n### Trade Strategy for Next Turn\nTo increase the total value, we need to look for trades that give us more value than we offer. Let's analyze potential trades:\n- Trading Wheat (Value: 6) for other resources:\n  - For Ore (Value: 38), it might be worth offering Wheat if we can get Ore.\n  - For Brick (Value: 24), offering Wheat could be a good start.\n- Trading Wood (Value: 12) for other resources:\n  - For Ore, we've done this successfully before. However, we need to be cautious as our Wood quantity decreased.\n  - For Brick, it could be an option.\n- Trading Sheep (Value: 15) or Brick (Value: 24) for higher-value resources like Ore could be beneficial.\n\n### New Offer\nLet's make a new offer that could potentially increase our total value. Considering our resources and the values:\n- Offering 3 Sheep for 1 Ore could be a good trade since 3 Sheep = 3 * 15 = 45 and 1 Ore = 38. However, it's not very favorable.\n- Offering 4 Brick for 2 Ore could be another option. 4 Brick = 4 * 24 = 96, and 2 Ore = 2 * 38 = 76, which doesn't seem favorable.\n\nLet's consider a potentially more favorable trade:\n- [Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\n\nThis translates to:\n- Offering: 4 Wheat (4*6 = 24) and 1 Sheep (1*15 = 15), Total = 24 + 15 = 39\n- Requesting: 2 Ore (2*38 = 76)\n\nSince 76 (value received) > 39 (value given), this trade is potentially beneficial.\n\n### Action\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
