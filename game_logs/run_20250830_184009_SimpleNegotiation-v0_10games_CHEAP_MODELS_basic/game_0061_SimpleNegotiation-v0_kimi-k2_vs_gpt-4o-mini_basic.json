Additional Ore is your single best gain.\n\nStrategy  \n1. Target more Ore first.  \n2. Be willing to pay with Wheat and Wood (cheapest) and then Sheep (mid).  \n3. Refuse deals that give away Ore for things worth less than 38 total value per Ore.  \n4. In secondary trades, accumulate Brick if we can get it cheaply; otherwise swap excess Brick for still more Ore.\n\nNow I will start the negotiation.\n\nPlayer 0: \u201cHello, I\u2019ve got a lot of resources and I\u2019m looking for Ore in particular.

Brick remains my highest value resource (392/1,023)\n\n**Proposed aggressive trade for Turn 9:**  \n[Offer: 7 Sheep, 3 Brick -> 4 Ore, 5 Wood]\n\nThis would:\n- Further reduce over-reliance on Brick (bringing it from 14 to 11 units)\n- Boost Ore back to healthier levels (from 8 to 12 units)\n- Maximize Wood production (from 8 to 13 units)\n- Accept the temporary loss in Sheep (11 to 4) since its value is high but not critical\n\nThis maintains balanced growth across all resources.",
