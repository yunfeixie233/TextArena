      "response": "### Negotiation Game Strategy\n\nAs Player0, my goal is to maximize the total value of my resources through trades. To begin, let's assess the resources I currently have and their total value.\n\n#### Initial Resources and Values\n+ [Wheat] Qty:6 Value:5\n+ [Wood] Qty:10 Value:10\n+ [Sheep] Qty:22 Value:12\n+ [Brick] Qty:6 Value:26\n+ [Ore] Qty:14 Value:33\n\n#### Initial Total Value Calculation\n1. Wheat: 6 * 5 = 30\n2. Wood: 10 * 10 = 100\n3. Sheep: 22 * 12 = 264\n4. Brick: 6 * 26 = 156\n5. Ore: 14 * 33 = 462\n\nTotal Initial Value = 30 + 100 + 264 + 156 + 462 = 1012\n\n#### Strategy\nTo increase the total value, I need to make trades that either increase the quantity of higher-value resources or exchange lower-value resources for higher-value ones. Given the resources I have, I'll look for opportunities to trade resources like Wheat (low value) or possibly Sheep (moderate value but high quantity) for resources that are either higher in value or scarce.\n\n#### First Turn Action\nSince I have a surplus of Sheep and a good amount of Ore, I'll start by making an offer that could potentially increase my total value. I notice that I have a relatively low quantity of Brick, which is a high-value resource. \n\nLet's make an offer to see if my opponent is interested in trading. I'll offer some Sheep (a resource I have in abundance) in exchange for Brick.\n\n'[Offer:5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]'\n\nThis offer is a starting point. I'm willing to negotiate based on the opponent's response.\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's reaction to this offer. \n\nSince I'm making the first move, I'll output my action directly:\n\n'[Offer:5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]'",

The total value I was offering was 5*12 = 60, and I was requesting 2*26 = 52 in return. This was not a good deal for me as I was losing value.\n\nLet's consider a more valuable trade. I have a lot of Sheep and Ore, and I need to think about what I can offer that might be attractive to Player 1 while improving my total value.\n\nGiven that Brick is very valuable to me and I have a lot of Sheep and Ore, I'll think about another trade that could be beneficial.\n\nIf I offer Ore, which is valuable, I might get a better response. Let's say I offer 2 Ore (Value: 33 each) for 1 Brick (Value: 26). This trade involves giving 2*33 = 66 in value to get 1*26 = 26 in return. This is still not a good trade for me.\n\nLet's analyze what I can offer and request in a different combination:\n- I can offer 3 Sheep (3*12 = 36) and request 1 Brick (1*26 = 26). This is still not very favorable.\n\nHowever, if I think about it, offering some Ore along with Sheep might be more appealing to Player 1, and I could ask for more in return.\n\nLet's make a new offer:\nI will offer 4 Sheep and 1 Ore in exchange for 2 Brick.\n\nThe total value I'm offering is (4*12) + (1*33) = 48 + 33 = 81.\nThe total value I'm requesting is 2*26 = 52.\n\nThis is still not a great trade for me since I'm giving more value than I'm getting.\n\nLet's directly calculate and propose a potentially more beneficial trade.\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick]\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds to this. \n\nMy next action is: [Offer: 2 Ore, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick]",

Player 0 offered 5 Sheep for 2 Brick, which was rejected.\n2. Player 1 made no counteroffer.\n3. There's a mention of Player 0 rejecting a trade offer, but it seems to be a misstatement since Player 0 made the initial offer.\n4. Player 0 then offered 2 Ore and 2 Sheep for 3 Brick, which was rejected.\n5. Player 1 made an offer of 2 Brick for 2 Ore.\n\nLet's evaluate Player 1's last offer: [Offered items: 2 Brick -> Requested items: 2 Ore]\n- Value of 2 Brick = 2 * 26 = 52\n- Value of 2 Ore = 2 * 33 = 66\n\nThis offer is not favorable because it involves giving up Ore (value 66) for Brick (value 52), resulting in a net loss of 14.\n\nHowever, let's reassess our resources and the potential trades considering the values:\n- We have a lot of Sheep and Ore, which are relatively valuable or have potential for trade.\n- We could look to trade some of our less valuable resources or those that are abundant for something more valuable.\n\nGiven that the last offer from Player 1 was not in our favor, we should consider making a new offer. Let's directly calculate the best possible trade.\n\nTo improve our total value, we could think about trading some of our resources. For instance, we could consider trading some Sheep (since we have a lot) or other resources for something of higher value or more scarcity.\n\nLet's analyze a potential trade:\n- Offering 2 Sheep (Value: 2*12 = 24) for a resource that could potentially increase our total value.\n\nGiven that Brick has a high value (26), let's think about acquiring more Brick:\n- We previously offered 5 Sheep for 2 Brick and got rejected.\n- Then we offered 2 Ore, 2 Sheep for 3 Brick, which was also rejected.\n\nLet's try a more conservative and potentially more acceptable offer for Player 1:\n- Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick\n\nValue of offered resources = (1*33) + (1*12) = 45\nValue of requested resource = 1*26 = 26\n\nThis offer still doesn't seem very favorable due to the negative difference in value. Let's reconsider our strategy and directly propose a trade.\n\nUpon reevaluation, a more favorable trade to propose could involve:\n- '[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick]'\n\nHere, we give up 4 Sheep (4*12 = 48) and get 2 Brick (2*26 = 52), which results in a slight gain of 4.\n\nThus, the proposed action is:\n'[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick]'\n\nLet's format this according to the required action format:\n'[Offer: 4 Sheep,  -> 2 Brick]' is adjusted to fit the exact required format.\n\nThe final action is: \n'[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick]'",

      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the current situation and resources.\nI am Player 0. My current resources are: [Wheat] Qty: 6 Value: 5, [Wood] Qty: 10 Value: 10, [Sheep] Qty: 22 Value: 12, [Brick] Qty: 6 Value: 26, [Ore] Qty: 14 Value: 33. The last trade was: I accepted an offer from Player 1 where I gave 1 Brick and received 2 Wheat and 1 Ore.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the new quantity of resources after the last trade.\nAfter accepting the trade offer from Player 1 (2 Wheat, 1 Ore -> 1 Brick), my resources changed as follows:\n- [Wheat] Qty: 6 + 2 = 8\n- [Ore] Qty: 14 + 1 = 15\n- [Brick] Qty: 6 - 1 = 5\nSo, my new resources are: [Wheat] Qty: 8, [Wood] Qty: 10, [Sheep] Qty: 22, [Brick] Qty: 5, [Ore] Qty: 15.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the current offer from Player 1.\nPlayer 1 made an offer: Offered items: 2 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore. This means I would give 1 Ore and receive 2 Sheep.\n\n## Step 4: Assess the value of the current offer.\nThe value of 1 Ore is 33, and the value of 2 Sheep is 2 * 12 = 24. Since 33 > 24, this trade is not in my favor.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on the current offer from Player 1.\nSince the trade is not in my favor (I would lose value), I should reject it. The action to reject is '[Deny]'.\n\n## Step 6: Consider making a new offer.\nI need to think about what I can offer that might be beneficial for both of us. Currently, I have [Wheat] Qty: 8, [Wood] Qty: 10, [Sheep] Qty: 22, [Brick] Qty: 5, [Ore] Qty: 15.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze potential trades.\nLet's consider trading some of my resources. One potential trade could involve my Sheep or Ore, as I have a significant quantity of both. However, I need to think about what Player 1 might be looking for.\n\n## Step 8: Recall previous trades and interactions.\nIn the previous turns, Player 1 accepted a trade where they gave 2 Brick and received 2 Ore. They also made an offer where they gave 2 Wheat and 1 Ore for 1 Brick, which I accepted. This indicates they might be looking for Ore or willing to give Wheat/Brick for it.\n\n## Step 9: Formulate a new trade offer based on the analysis.\nSince Player 1 was willing to give Brick for Ore, I could consider offering Ore for Brick again or something similar. I have 15 Ore, and my Brick quantity is 5. If I offer Ore for Brick, it could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 10: Propose a specific trade.\nLet's offer 1 Ore for 1 Brick. The value of 1 Ore is 33, and the value of 1 Brick is 26. This trade is still not in my favor. However, considering I have a lot of Ore and not so many Bricks, and given that Player 1 has shown willingness to trade Brick for Ore, I should think about a reasonable ratio.\n\n## Step 11: Adjust the trade offer to be more favorable.\nIf I offer 2 Ore for 1 Brick, the total value given is 2 * 33 = 66, and the value received is 26. This is still not good. How about offering 1 Ore for 2 Brick (if I had more Brick) or finding another combination?\n\n## Step 12: Reconsider my resources and think about a trade that could be beneficial.\nI could offer some Sheep (which I have a lot of) for Brick. For instance, offering 3 Sheep (value = 3 * 12 = 36) for 1 Brick (value = 26) is not good. But if I offer 2 Sheep for 1 Brick, that's 24 for 26, which is slightly better.\n\n## Step 13: Decide on a new trade offer.\nLet's offer 4 Sheep for 2 Brick. This means I give 4 * 12 = 48 value in Sheep and receive 2 * 26 = 52 value in Brick. This is a slight gain for me.\n\n## Step 14: Formulate the trade offer in the required format.\nThe offer would be: '[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick]'.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick]}$",
