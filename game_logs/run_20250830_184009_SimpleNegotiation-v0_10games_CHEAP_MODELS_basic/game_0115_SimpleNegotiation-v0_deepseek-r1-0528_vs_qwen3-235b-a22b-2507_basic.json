This significantly boosts my total value.  \n  - **Resource Surplus:** I have 7 Brick left after the trade, which remains ample. Adding Sheep (rising to 17) and Wood (to 24) diversifies holdings while clearing less valuable surplus.  \n  - **Player 1\u2019s Incentive:** Given their past acceptance of this exact offer, they likely need Brick and value Sheep/Wood less. Replicating it has a higher chance of acceptance.\n\nThis trade leverages my resource strengths (high Brick value) and Player 1\u2019s demonstrated preferences.
