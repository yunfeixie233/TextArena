      "response": "### Game Analysis and Initial Strategy\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, the goal is to increase the total value of the resources held. The initial resources and their values are:\n\n- Wheat: 22 units, Value: 6\n- Wood: 8 units, Value: 8\n- Sheep: 19 units, Value: 12\n- Brick: 6 units, Value: 22\n- Ore: 22 units, Value: 38\n\nThe total initial value of resources can be calculated as follows:\n- Total Value = (22*6) + (8*8) + (19*12) + (6*22) + (22*38)\n- Total Value = 132 + 64 + 228 + 132 + 836 = 1392\n\nTo maximize the total value, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or at least maintain the quantity of high-value resources while acquiring more of other valuable resources.\n\n### Initial Observation\n\n1. **Ore** is the highest value resource, and we have a substantial quantity of it (22 units).\n2. **Brick** is the second-highest value resource per unit, but we have a relatively low quantity (6 units).\n3. **Sheep**, while not the highest value, is abundant (19 units).\n\n### Trade Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value, we can consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Maintain or Increase High-Value Resources (Ore and Brick):** Since Ore is highly valued and we already possess a significant amount, our focus should be on not losing it. Brick is also valuable, and increasing its quantity could be beneficial.\n\n2. **Trade Lower Value Resources:** Resources like Wheat and Wood have lower values. Trading them for resources of higher value or at least maintaining their quantity while gaining something more valuable could be a good strategy.\n\n### Initial Trade Offer\n\nConsidering the above, a potential initial trade could involve offering resources of lower value in exchange for Brick or maintaining the current high-value resources. However, without knowing the opponent's resources, we'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nLet's observe that we have a good amount of Sheep and Ore, which are relatively high in value or quantity. We could offer some Sheep (since we have a decent amount and it's not the lowest value) or Wheat (the lowest value resource) in exchange for Brick or potentially more Ore if the opponent has it.\n\n### First Turn Action\n\nLet's make an offer that could potentially increase our Brick quantity, as it's valuable and we have a low quantity:\n`[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 3 Brick]`\n\nThis offer gives away:\n- 5 Sheep = 5 * 12 = 60 value\n- 2 Wheat = 2 * 6 = 12 value\nTotal given away = 72 value\n\nIn exchange for:\n- 3 Brick = 3 * 22 = 66 value\n\nThis isn't a great trade value-wise, but it increases our Brick quantity. Let's see the opponent's response.\n\n### Response to Opponent\n\nWe'll wait for the opponent's response to our initial offer. If they accept, we'll proceed with the trade. If they deny or make a counteroffer, we'll reassess and respond accordingly.\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's move... \n\nSince we are at the start, I'll just output the action:\n`[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 3 Brick]`",

Offered 5 Sheep, 2 Wheat for 3 Brick (Rejected)\n2. Offered 3 Ore for 2 Brick (Accepted)\n3. Offered 4 Wood for 2 Sheep (Accepted)\n4. Offered 5 Wheat for 1 Ore (Accepted)\n\n**New Turn:**\nWe have 6 turns remaining. The last offer made was accepted. Since Player 1 made no new trade offer, we need to analyze our current resources and decide on the next offer.\n\n**Analysis:**\nAfter the last trade, our total value is:\n(17 * 6) + (4 * 8) + (21 * 12) + (11 * 22) + (19 * 38) = \n102 + 32 + 252 + 242 + 722 = 1350\n\nTo increase the total value, we need to think about the resources we have and what we can trade. We have a good amount of Sheep and Ore, which are relatively valuable.\n\n**New Offer:**\nLet's think about a potential trade. We can consider offering some of our less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\nOne potential trade could be: Offer 3 Sheep for 1 Ore.\n\nHowever, we should check if there's a more beneficial trade.\n\nAn alternative trade is: Offer 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick (However, we only have 4 Wood left, so this might not be feasible)\n\nAnother alternative is: Offer 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore (This is quite a valuable trade, but it depends on what Player 1 is willing to accept)\n\nLet's go with a more conservative trade: [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\n**Action:**\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

We can try to exchange some of our other resources for more valuable ones or try to get more Ore (although it's already abundant).\n\nOne possible trade could be: Offer some Wheat (not very valuable) for something more valuable.\n\n**Trade Offer:**\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\n\nThis is a potential trade. If Player 1 accepts, we will lose 4 x 6 = 24 value but gain 1 x 22 = 22 value. This is not a good trade. Let's think of something better.\n\nAfter re-evaluating, I propose the following trade:\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 2 Sheep]\n\nThis trade might be more beneficial.\n\nLet's send the offer.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 2 Sheep]",
