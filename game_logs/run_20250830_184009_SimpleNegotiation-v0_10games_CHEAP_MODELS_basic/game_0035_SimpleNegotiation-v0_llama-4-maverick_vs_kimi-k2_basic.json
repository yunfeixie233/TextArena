      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to analyze the current values and quantities of the resources I have and think about potential trades that could increase my total value.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of my current resources:\n- Wheat: 16 * 6 = 96\n- Wood: 13 * 8 = 104\n- Sheep: 14 * 18 = 252\n- Brick: 17 * 21 = 357\n- Ore: 13 * 40 = 520\n\nTotal value = 96 + 104 + 252 + 357 + 520 = 1329\n\nTo increase this total value, I should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given the values, Ore is the most valuable resource, and Wheat is the least valuable. \n\nSince I have a significant amount of Brick and a high quantity of Ore, I should be cautious not to trade away too much of these high-value resources. However, I can consider trading some of my less valuable resources or those that are not as highly valued to get more of the higher-valued resources or to get a better deal.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. I could offer some Wheat (least valuable) or Wood (second least valuable) for more valuable resources.\n2. I have a good quantity of Brick, but it's less valuable than Ore and Sheep per unit. I might consider trading some Brick for more Ore or Sheep if the rate is favorable.\n\nFor my first turn, I'll make an offer that tries to increase my total value by potentially trading less valuable resources for more valuable ones. \n\nLet's say I offer 3 Wheat (Value: 3*6 = 18) and 2 Wood (Value: 2*8 = 16) for 1 Ore (Value: 40). The total value I'm offering is 18 + 16 = 34, and I'm requesting a resource worth 40.\n\nMy offer: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis is a straightforward attempt to gain more Ore by giving away resources of lower total value.

Thus, it is not beneficial.\n\n### Next Action\n\nSince accepting Player 1's offer is not favorable, we should consider making a new offer. Let's analyze the resources and think about a trade that could be beneficial.\n\nWe have a high-value resource, Ore (Value: 40), and we have made previous attempts to trade other resources for Ore. Let's consider offering Sheep, which has a lower value than Ore but is still relatively valuable.\n\n#### New Offer:\nLet's propose: **3 Sheep -> 1 Ore**\n\n- **Offered:** 3 Sheep (3 * 18 = 54)\n- **Requested:** 1 Ore (1 * 40 = 40)\n\nFor Player 0, this means:\n- Losing 3 Sheep (54)\n- Gaining 1 Ore (40)\n\nNet Change in Value for Player 0 = 40 - 54 = -14\n\nThis offer is still not beneficial as it results in a loss. Let's adjust our strategy.\n\n#### Alternative Offer:\nConsider: **[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**\n\n- **Offered:** 2 Wood (2 * 8 = 16), 1 Sheep (1 * 18 = 18), Total = 34\n- **Requested:** 1 Ore (1 * 40 = 40)\n\nFor Player 0, this means:\n- Losing 2 Wood and 1 Sheep (Total: 34)\n- Gaining 1 Ore (40)\n\nNet Change in Value for Player 0 = 40 - 34 = +6\n\nThis is a positive gain.

Since Ore is the most valuable resource, we should try to get more of it.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a New Offer\nTo gain Ore, let's see what we can offer. Our previous offers to get 1 Ore included giving 3 Wheat, 2 Wood; 4 Brick; and 2 Wood, 1 Sheep. Let's try to optimize this.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Resources to Offer for Ore\nLet's directly calculate the value of resources we can offer for 1 Ore (Value = 40).\n- Offering Wheat: 40 / 6 = 6.67, so 7 Wheat (since we can't offer fractions) could be a fair trade, but we have to check if it's beneficial and feasible.\n- Offering Wood: 40 / 8 = 5, so 5 Wood.\n- Offering Sheep: 40 / 18 = 2.22, so 3 Sheep.\n- Offering Brick: 40 / 21 = 1.9, so 2 Brick.\n\n## Step 5: Make a New Offer\nLet's make a new offer based on the analysis. We have enough resources to make a trade. One potential offer could involve offering resources that are less valuable to us but could be more valuable to Player 1.\n\nLet's consider offering **4 Wheat -> 1 Ore** as it is relatively less costly compared to other resources when normalized by value, and we have a good quantity of Wheat.\n\n## Step 6: Check the Feasibility and Benefit of the New Offer\n- We have 16 Wheat, and offering 4 Wheat leaves us with 12 Wheat.\n- Value given: \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\)\n- Value received: \\(1 \\times 40 = 40\\)\n- This trade is beneficial.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]}$",

Let's analyze our resources again and think about a potential trade.\n\nWe have a significant amount of Brick (18) and not as much Ore relative to its value. We've just lost some Ore potential in the last consideration. Let's think about offering some Brick for Ore or other valuable resources.\n\nMaking a new offer: We could offer some Brick for Ore. Let's try to negotiate for 1 or 2 Ore.\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nLet's send this offer and see how Player 1 responds. \n\n[Offer: 3 Brick, 0 Ore -> 1 Ore] is the same as [Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nSo the action is: [Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
