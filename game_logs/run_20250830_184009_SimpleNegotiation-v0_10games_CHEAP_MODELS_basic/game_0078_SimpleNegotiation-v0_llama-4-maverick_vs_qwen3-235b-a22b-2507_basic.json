      "response": "### Negotiation Game: Initial Assessment\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: Qty: 22, Value: 5\n- Wood: Qty: 22, Value: 9\n- Sheep: Qty: 8, Value: 15\n- Brick: Qty: 14, Value: 24\n- Ore: Qty: 23, Value: 39\n\n#### Total Current Value:\nTo determine the initial total value, we calculate:\n- Wheat: 22 * 5 = 110\n- Wood: 22 * 9 = 198\n- Sheep: 8 * 15 = 120\n- Brick: 14 * 24 = 336\n- Ore: 23 * 39 = 897\n- Total = 110 + 198 + 120 + 336 + 897 = 1661\n\n#### Strategy:\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources through trading. To do this effectively, we need to identify which resources are more valuable and try to accumulate those. Currently, Ore has the highest value, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\n#### Initial Offer:\nTo start, let's analyze potential trades. Since Ore is the most valuable resource we have, we should try not to give it away unless we receive something of significantly higher total value in return. Let's look at what we can offer and what we might request.\n\nGiven the current quantities and values, a reasonable initial offer could involve trading some of our less valuable resources for more valuable ones or consolidating resources of higher value.\n\nLet's make an initial offer that involves trading some of our less valuable resources (in terms of unit value) for something more valuable or equally valuable but in a different category.\n\n### First Turn Action:\nLet's propose: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]`\n\n- We are offering: 5 Wheat (Value: 5*5 = 25) and 3 Wood (Value: 3*9 = 27), totaling a value of 52.\n- We are requesting: 2 Brick (Value: 2*24 = 48).\n\nThis trade slightly increases our total value and allows us to get more Brick, which is relatively valuable.\n\nIf there's an incoming offer, we'll assess it based on the value exchange. If not, this will be our starting point.\n\n### Action:\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]`",

I need to think of a new offer.\n\nUpon analyzing the last trade, I realized that the offer I made: [Offered items: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> Requested items: 5 Brick, 2 Wheat] was accepted by Player 1. This was a good trade for me. \n\nTo make a new offer, I should think about what resources I have in abundance and what resources are valuable. I have a good quantity of Wheat, Wood, and Ore. \n\nLet's make a new offer: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]. However, I already tried a similar offer and was rejected. Let me rethink.\n\nAn alternative offer could be: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]. This offer is somewhat similar to my previous offer, but with a slightly different combination.\n\nLet me check if this is a good trade: \n- I'm offering 5 Wheat (value: 5 * 5 = 25) and 1 Wood (value: 9), totaling 34.\n- I'm requesting 1 Brick (value: 24).\n\nThis is not a good trade for me as I'm offering more value than I'm requesting. Let me think of another combination.\n\nAn alternative offer could be: [Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep]. \n- I'm offering 2 Wood (value: 2 * 9 = 18).\n- I'm requesting 1 Sheep (value: 15).\n\nThis is not a good trade for me either.\n\nLet me re-examine the resources and try again.\n\nAfter retrying, I have come up with a new offer: [Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore].\n- I'm offering 3 Brick (value: 3 * 24 = 72).\n- I'm requesting 1 Ore (value: 39).\n\nThis is still not a good trade.\n\nLet me check the current turn and think about the last offer.\n\nThe current turn is 9. I still have a few resources that could be used for a trade.\n\nSince my last few offers were rejected, I will try one more time.\n\nMy new offer is: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick].\n\nMy response is: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
