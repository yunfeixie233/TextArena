Given that my Ore is valued at 40 and Brick at 23, trading 2 Ore for 2 Brick was a net loss of value (2 * 40 - 2 * 23 = 80 - 46 = 34 value decrease). I should be more careful about the value exchange.\n\nLet's look at the value ratios of my resources to find beneficial trades:\n- Wheat: 6\n- Wood: 8\n- Sheep: 17\n- Brick: 23\n- Ore: 40\n\nI have a lot of Ore and a decent amount of Brick. I also have a lot of Sheep.\nMy Brick value is 23, and Ore value is 40.\nMy Sheep value is 17. Wood is 8. Wheat is 6.\n\nI should try to trade my lower-value scarce resources for higher-value abundant ones, or trade redundant abundant resources for scarce high-value ones.\n\nI have 18 Sheep and 23 Ore.\n\nI could try to trade some sheep for brick or ore.\n2 Sheep (34 value) for 1 Brick (23 value) is a bad trade.\n3 Sheep (51 value) for 1 Ore (40 value) is a bad trade.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep (18) and Ore (23), and a fair amount of Brick (15). My goal is total value.\n\nPerhaps I should try to acquire more high-value items like Ore and Brick, even if I have some.\nWhat if I offer lower value resources for higher value ones?\nI have 7 Wheat and 7 Wood. These are my lowest value resources.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat for something.\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick] (18 value for 23 value) - good for me.\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick] (12+8=20 value for 23 value) - good for me.\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Wheat] (16 value for 6 value) - bad for me.\n\nLet's try to offload some of my high quantities that also have good value.\nI have a lot of Sheep (18). 17 value per Sheep.\nI have a lot of Ore (23). 40 value per Ore.\nI have a lot of Brick (15). 23 value per Brick.\n\nI'm player 0, so I want to make the offer.\nI want to gain value.\nI'll offer something I have a lot of, and try to get something high-value.\n\nLet's consider trading some Sheep.\nSheep value: 17\nBrick value: 23\nOre value: 40\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick] (34 value for 23 value) - Player 1 would accept if they need brick and have few sheep. This would be a loss for me.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep] (23 value for 34 value) - Good for me! But player 1 probably won't accept this.\n\nLet's re-evaluate player 0 strategy:\nCurrent Inventory:\nWheat: 7 (Value 6) -> 42\nWood: 7 (Value 8) -> 56\nSheep: 18 (Value 17) -> 306\nBrick: 15 (Value 23) -> 345\nOre: 23 (Value 40) -> 920\nTotal Value: 1669\n\nLast turn I made a bad trade (2 Ore -> 2 Brick was a loss of 34 value). I need to make trades that increase my *total value*.\n\nMy aim is to maximize total value.\nTherefore, I want to acquire items with higher value for items with lower value, based on their individual values.\n\nPotential trades that increase my value:\n- Receive Ore (40), Give anything with total value < 40\n- Receive Brick (23), Give anything with total value < 23\n- Receive Sheep (17), Give anything with total value < 17\n- Receive Wood (8), Give anything with total value < 8\n- Receive Wheat (6), Give anything with total value < 6\n\nI'll try to trade up my lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\nI have 7 Wheat (6 value each).\nI have 7 Wood (8 value each).\n\nProposed trade:\nOffer: 2 Wheat (12 value)\nRequest: 1 Sheep (17 value)\nThis is a gain of 5 value for me. Might be acceptable for Player 1 if they have a lot of Sheep and need Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]",
