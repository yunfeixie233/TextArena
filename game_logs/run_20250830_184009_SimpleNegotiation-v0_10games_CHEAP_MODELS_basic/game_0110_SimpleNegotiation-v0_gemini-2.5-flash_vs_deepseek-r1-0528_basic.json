I should aim to trade resources I have in abundance or those with lower individual value for resources with higher individual value, especially Brick and Ore.\n\nI have a relatively high quantity of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep. Brick and Ore have higher values.\n\nI notice Player 1 accepted my previous offer, which indicates they might be interested in Sheep and Wood.

However, my goal is to *increase* total value.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the strategy. I need to get a clear *profit* from each trade.\n\nMy high-value items are Brick (30) and Ore (32).\nMy low-value items are Wheat (6), Wood (9), Sheep (13).\n\nI want to sell low and buy high.\n\nLet me try to get some Ore.
