      "response": "### Current State of Resources\n\nAfter the last trade, the state of my resources is as follows:\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Initially 10, I offered 5 + 2 = 7 in total. So, I have 10 - 7 = 3 left.\n- **[Wood]**: Initially 12, I offered 4 + 2 = 6 in total. So, I have 12 - 6 = 6 left.\n- **[Sheep]**: Initially 16, I offered 0. So, I have 16 left.\n- **[Brick]**: Initially 7, I received 2. So, I have 7 + 2 = 9 now.\n- **[Ore]**: Initially 7, I received 1 + 1 = 2. So, I have 7 + 2 = 9 now.\n\nThus, my current resources are:\n+ [Wheat]   Qty: 3   Value: 6\n+ [Wood]    Qty: 6   Value: 10\n+ [Sheep]   Qty: 16   Value: 16\n+ [Brick]   Qty: 9   Value: 24\n+ [Ore]     Qty: 9   Value: 34\n\n### Total Value of Current Resources\n\nLet's calculate the total value:\n- **[Wheat]**: 3 * 6 = 18\n- **[Wood]**: 6 * 10 = 60\n- **[Sheep]**: 16 * 16 = 256\n- **[Brick]**: 9 * 24 = 216\n- **[Ore]**: 9 * 34 = 306\n\nTotal Value = 18 + 60 + 256 + 216 + 306 = 856\n\n### Previous Turns Analysis\n\n1. **First Offer**: I offered 5 Wheat, 4 Wood for 2 Brick, 1 Ore. It was accepted. The value given away was (5*6) + (4*10) = 30 + 40 = 70, and the value received was (2*24) + (1*34) = 48 + 34 = 82. So, the net gain was +12.\n2. **Second Offer**: I offered 3 Wood for 2 Ore. It was rejected.\n3. **Third Offer**: I offered 4 Sheep for 1 Ore. It was rejected.\n4. **Fourth Offer**: I offered 2 Wheat, 2 Wood for 1 Ore. It was accepted. The value given away was (2*6) + (2*10) = 12 + 20 = 32, and the value received was 1*34 = 34. So, the net gain was +2.\n\n### Next Action\n\nConsidering my current resources and the history of trades, my next step should be to analyze what I can offer or request that would be beneficial.\n\nSince my last offer was accepted and I gained some value, I should continue to look for opportunities that increase my total value. I have a good quantity of Sheep and have gained Ore in the last trade. \n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of my Sheep for a resource that is either highly valued or scarce for me. However, my previous offer involving Sheep was rejected.\n\nLet's directly frame a new offer:\n\nI will offer 3 Sheep for 1 Ore. Although my last offer involving Sheep was rejected, the quantity and request are different this time.\n\n### Trade Offer for This Turn\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds to this offer. \n\n### Command\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
