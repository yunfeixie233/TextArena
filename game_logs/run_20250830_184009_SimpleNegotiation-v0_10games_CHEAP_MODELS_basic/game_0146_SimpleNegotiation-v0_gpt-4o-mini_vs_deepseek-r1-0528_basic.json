      "response": "Based on the current resource situation and trade history, let's analyze the available options before proceeding. \n\nCurrently, your resources are as follows after accepting the offer from Player 1:\n\n- **Resources**:\n  - Wheat: 23 (Value: 6)\n  - Wood: 14 (Value: 8)\n  - Sheep: 10 (Value: 16)  (after giving away 4 Sheep to Player 1)\n  - Brick: 0 \n  - Ore: 8 (after giving away 1 Ore to Player 1)\n\nNow, Player 1 is offering 1 Ore for 4 Wood. Evaluating that offer:\n\n- Your current Wood Quantity: 14\n- Trading away 4 Wood would leave you with 10 Wood.\n- Current Ore Quantity: 8 + 1 (from trade) = 9 Ore after the trade.\n\n**Value Analysis**:\n- Trading 4 Wood (Value: 8 each) leads to a value of 32 being lost.\n- Gaining 1 Ore (Value: 38) has a relatively high underlying value.\n\nWhile the immediate value loss on the Wood is significant, gaining Ore can be beneficial if it leads to a future trade that produces gainful exchanges. \n\n### Decision:\nI will **reject** Player 1's offer to keep my Wood resource available for more favorable trades in future turns. \n\nHence, I will respond with:\n\n```\n[Deny]\n```",
