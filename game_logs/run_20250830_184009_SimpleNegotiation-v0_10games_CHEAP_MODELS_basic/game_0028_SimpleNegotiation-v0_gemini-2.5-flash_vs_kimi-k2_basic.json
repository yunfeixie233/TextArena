The value of 10 Wheat is 50, and the value of 2 Ore is 78. This was a good deal for me, but it seems Player 1 wasn't interested. I should try to get rid of some Wheat, as I have a lot of it and it's my lowest value resource. I also need to get more high-value resources.\n\nLet's try to offer a slightly more balanced trade, but still favorable to me.\n\nNegotiation Strategies:\n1. Try to trade low-value resources for high-value resources.\n2. Maintain a diverse set of resources.\n3. Don't overpay for resources.\n\nConsidering Player 1 rejected my previous offer, they might be looking for something that benefits them more. They might also not be interested in Ore. I'll offer a trade where I give up some Wheat and get something more valuable, but fewer units.\n\nLet's try: [Offer: 15 Wheat -> 2 Brick]\nValue of 15 Wheat = 15 * 5 = 75\nValue of 2 Brick = 2 * 25 = 50\nThis offer is in my favor, but if Player 1 has a lot of Brick, they might be willing to trade. However, if they just rejected 10 Wheat for 2 Ore, which was good for me, maybe they want more of my higher value resources.\n\nWhat if I offer a higher value resource, but less of it?\n[Offer: 1 Wood -> 1 Wheat] - This doesn't make sense as Wood is higher value.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. I have 24 Wheat, which is a lot. Player 1 rejected 10 Wheat for 2 Ore. They might not value Ore highly, or they might think their Ore is worth more.\n\nMy goal is to increase total value.\nLet's try to trade Wheat for something of slightly higher value.\n\nWhat if I offer Wheat and some of a mid-value resource, like Sheep, for a higher-value resource? No, that's giving up too much.\n\nLet's consider that Player 1 might be hoarding specific resources. I should try to offer something that I have in abundance for something I lack or something with higher value.\n\nI still want to get rid of Wheat. Maybe Player 1 needs Wheat.\n\nNew strategy: Offer a slightly more appealing trade for Player 1, but still beneficial to me. I'll lower the amount of Wheat I offer for a higher value resource they might need.\n\nLet's try to get Brick.\n[Offer: 12 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nValue of 12 Wheat = 12 * 5 = 60\nValue of 1 Brick = 1 * 25 = 25\nThis is still very much in my favor. Player 1 might still reject.\n\nWhat if I offer a smaller amount of Wheat for a smaller amount of higher value resources, like Wood?\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Wood]\nValue of 3 Wheat = 15\nValue of 1 Wood = 9\nThis is still in my favour. Player 1 might accept this as it's a small trade. It helps me slowly get rid of Wheat for higher value resources.\n\nLet's try to get either Wood or Brick. Player 1 might have excess Wood or Brick.\n\nMy goal is to increase my total value.\nI have a surplus of Wheat. My lowest quantity is Sheep and Ore.\nIf Player 1 rejected 10 Wheat for 2 Ore, maybe they don't need Wheat, or they value ore very highly.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Offer a small amount of resources for a slightly larger amount of lower value resources, if they need it. No, that's not good.\n\nLet's try to get Brick.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nValue of 10 Wheat = 50\nValue of 1 Brick = 25\nThis is very skewed in my favor.\n\nI need to make an offer that Player 1 might accept.\nWhat if Player 1 has a lot of Wood and needs Wheat?\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood]\nValue of 5 Wheat = 25\nValue of 1 Wood = 9\nStill in my favour. It depends on what Player 1 needs.\n\nGiven that Player 1 rejected the previous offer, they are looking for a better deal or have different priorities.\nI have plenty of Wheat. My strategy is to convert Wheat into higher value resources.\n\nLet's try to get some Sheep or Brick.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]\nValue of 10 Wheat = 50\nValue of 1 Sheep = 17\nStill very favorable to me.\n\nPerhaps I should offer a more valuable resource for an even higher value resource, if I can make a profit.\nFor example, using Wood to get Ore or Brick.\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]\nValue of 2 Wood = 18\nValue of 1 Brick = 25\nThis is good for me. But I don't have a lot of Wood.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat. I want to convert it.\nWhat if I try to get something small and valuable?\n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]\nValue of 8 Wheat = 40\nValue of 1 Sheep = 17\n\nOkay, let's make an offer that isn't too greedy, but still beneficial.\nI will try to trade Wheat for Wood, as Wood is slightly higher value and I have a significant amount of Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Wood]\nMy value: 6 * 5 = 30\nTheir value: 1 * 9 = 9\nThis is still very much in my favor. I need to get closer to a 1:1 value ratio for Player 1 to accept, or a deal where Player 1 gets a resource they desperately need.\n\nWhat if I offer something more substantial?\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 2 Wood]\nValue of 15 Wheat = 75\nValue of 2 Wood = 18\nStill too much in my favor.\n\nLet's try to offer a small amount of Wheat for a small amount of a slightly higher-value resource, aiming for acceptance.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood]\nValue for me: 25. Value for player 1: 9. Still too much.\n\nI need to think from Player 1's perspective. After rejecting my last offer, they might want to see me make a more \"fair\" offer, or an offer of a resource they actually need.\n\nGiven I have 24 Wheat, I can afford to give up a lot.\nLet's try a trade for Brick. Brick is 25 value. Wheat is 5 value.\n5 Wheat = 25. So 5 Wheat for 1 Brick is a 1:1 value trade.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nMy value: 25. Their value: 25. This is a fair trade value-wise, if they need Brick.\nThis seems like a good starting point for a fair \"value-for-value\" trade.\n\nLet's try this. It's a fair value trade for both parties, which might increase the chance of acceptance.\nI am Player 0. My goal is to increase my own total value. A 1:1 value trade still means I convert a lower value resource into a higher value resource, which is good for me. Quantity-wise I'm giving up 5 and gaining 1, which reduces my quantity of Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
