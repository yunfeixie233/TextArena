Brick and Ore are your highest-value resources. Player 0 has been trading Sheep/Brick/Wood aggressively, and you've managed to gain some Brick. Now, to further increase value, consider:\n\n- **Ore trade**: Your 11 Ore are valuable. If you can trade Ore for multiple Brick/Sheep, it\u2019s beneficial.\n- **Sheep trade**: You have 17 Sheep (expensive to hold). Trading some Sheep for higher-value resources (Ore or Brick) could help.\n\n### Next Move:\nOffer a trade leveraging your surplus Sheep/OR Wood for high-value Ores/Bricks. A balanced offer:\n\n**[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore]**\n- Giving: 2 Sheep (26) + 1 Wood (12) = 38\n- Receiving: 1 Ore (38)  \nThis is perfectly value-neutral but would give you a very high-value Ore (especially since Ore is scarcer and Player 0 may accept).\n\nAlternatively, if Player 0 declines, adjust next turn (e.g., [Offer: 3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore]).\n\n### Action:\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
