      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I will start by evaluating my current resources and their values.\n\n### Initial Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: 13 units, Value: 6\n- Wood: 14 units, Value: 11\n- Sheep: 15 units, Value: 15\n- Brick: 12 units, Value: 27\n- Ore: 8 units, Value: 36\n\n### Strategy:\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given the values, Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, then Sheep, Wood, and Wheat being the least valuable.\n\n### First Turn:\nI will start by making an offer that could potentially increase my total value. I notice that I have a relatively high quantity of Sheep and a moderate quantity of Wood, both of which are less valuable than Brick and Ore.\n\nLet's examine possible trades:\n1. Trading some of my less valuable resources (Wheat, Wood, or Sheep) for more valuable ones (Brick or Ore) could be beneficial.\n\n### Offer:\nI will offer 2 Wood (Value: 11 each) and 2 Sheep (Value: 15 each) in exchange for 1 Ore (Value: 36). The total value I'm offering is (2*11) + (2*15) = 22 + 30 = 52. The value I'm requesting is 1*36 = 36. This is not a good trade for me as I'm losing value.\n\nLet's consider a more balanced trade:\nI will offer 1 Wheat (Value: 6) and 1 Wood (Value: 11) in exchange for 1 Brick (Value: 27). The total value I'm offering is 6 + 11 = 17, and the value I'm getting is 27. This seems like a reasonable trade.\n\n### Action:\n`[Offer: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis is my first turn.
