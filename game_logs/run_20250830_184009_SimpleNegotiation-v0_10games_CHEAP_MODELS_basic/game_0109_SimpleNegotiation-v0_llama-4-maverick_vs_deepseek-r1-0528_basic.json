      "response": "### Negotiation Game Analysis and Action\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: Qty: 15, Value: 5\n- Wood: Qty: 9, Value: 12\n- Sheep: Qty: 17, Value: 16\n- Brick: Qty: 9, Value: 22\n- Ore: Qty: 5, Value: 32\n\n#### Total Current Value:\nTo determine the most valuable trades, first, we need to calculate the total current value of our resources.\n- Total Value = (15*5) + (9*12) + (17*16) + (9*22) + (5*32)\n- Total Value = 75 + 108 + 272 + 198 + 160\n- Total Value = 813\n\n#### Initial Assessment:\nOur resources are varied, and we have a good mix. To increase our total value, we should look for trades that give us resources of higher value in exchange for resources of lower value.\n\n#### Potential Trades:\n1. **Wheat (Value: 5)** is the lowest value resource. We should consider trading it away for something of higher value.\n2. **Wood (Value: 12)** is another relatively low-value resource. Trading it for higher-value resources could be beneficial.\n\n#### Trade Offer:\nLet's make an initial offer that trades away some of our lower-value resources for higher-value ones. Since Brick (Value: 22) and Ore (Value: 32) are among our higher-value resources but we still have a decent amount of Sheep (Value: 16), we can consider trading some Wheat and/or Wood for more Brick or Ore if possible.\n\n#### Proposed Offer:\nWe can offer 5 Wheat (total value of 25) and 2 Wood (total value of 24) in exchange for 2 Brick (total value of 44). This trade increases our total value by reducing lower-value resources and gaining higher-value ones.\n\n- Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick\n\n#### Action:\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick]`\n\nLet's see how the opponent responds and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next turn.",

      "response": "After evaluating my current resources and the trades that have occurred, I see an opportunity to further increase my total value by leveraging the observed patterns. Player 0 has consistently accepted offers where I trade wheat and wood for brick, indicating they value these resources in exchange. My current wheat and wood quantities are sufficient for a strategic trade, while my brick holdings have high value (30 per unit).\n\nI propose the following trade to capitalize on this pattern:  \n- **Offer**: Trade 7 Wheat and 7 Wood for 6 Brick.  \n  - *My valuation*:  \n    - Giving: 7 Wheat \u00d7 6 = 42, 7 Wood \u00d7 11 = 77 \u2192 Total cost = 119.  \n    - Receiving: 6 Brick \u00d7 30 = 180 \u2192 Net gain of 61.  \n  Given Player 0's past acceptance of similar ratios (e.g., 5 Wheat + 5 Wood for 4 Brick), this offer aligns with their behavior while significantly boosting my value.\n\nThe trade also reduces my lower-value wheat and wood holdings, concentrating my portfolio in high-value brick (30), sheep (12), and ore (33). After the trade, my wood reserve remains at 2, preserving flexibility for future actions.\n\nI present the offer now to maximize gains with the remaining turns.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat, 7 Wood -> 6 Brick]",

Let's formulate a counteroffer or a new offer.\n\n### New Offer\n\nTo improve our resource value, let's think about what we can offer and what would be beneficial to request.\n\nWe can offer some Wheat and Wood since we have a considerable amount of them. Let's aim to request something of higher value, like Ore or more Brick if possible.\n\nLet's make an offer: \n- Offered: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> Requested: 3 Ore\n\nCalculation:\n- Offered Value: (6 * 5) + (4 * 12) = 30 + 48 = 78\n- Requested Value: 3 * 32 = 96\n\nThis offer is in our favor as we gain a net value of 18.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Ore]`",
