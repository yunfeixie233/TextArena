      "response": "To begin, I'll examine my resources and their values:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 17   Value: 6   Total Value: 17 * 6 = 102\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 15   Value: 8   Total Value: 15 * 8 = 120\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 6    Value: 15  Total Value: 6 * 15 = 90\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 7    Value: 21  Total Value: 7 * 21 = 147\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 7    Value: 36  Total Value: 7 * 36 = 252\n\nTotal value of my current resources = 102 + 120 + 90 + 147 + 252 = 711\n\nMy strategy is to maximize the total value by making trades that increase it. I will start by identifying resources that are less valuable to me and could potentially be traded for resources of higher value or more quantity of a resource that has a significant value.\n\nGiven the current values and quantities, I notice that Wheat (total value: 102) is the least valuable resource I have in terms of total value, and its unit value is also the lowest among all resources. Wood is another resource with a relatively lower unit value.\n\nTo initiate a trade, I'll consider what I can offer and what I can request. Since Ore has the highest unit value and I already have a decent amount of it, I might not want to give it away easily. However, I can think about trading some of my less valuable resources for more of a higher-value resource or maintaining a balance.\n\nFor the first turn, I'll propose a trade that involves offering some Wheat (the lowest unit value resource) in exchange for Brick (a higher unit value resource). \n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\nThis is my first move. I am offering 5 Wheat (Value: 5 * 6 = 30) for 1 Brick (Value: 21). This seems like a potentially good starting point as it involves giving away a resource with a lower unit value for one with a higher unit value, though the immediate swap isn't very favorable in terms of total value. However, having more Brick or other high-value resources could be beneficial in future trades.\n\nLet's see the response from the opponent and proceed accordingly. \n\nMy action for Turn 1: \n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'",

Given the current resource values, Ore (Value = 36) is the most valuable, followed by Brick (Value = 21), Sheep (Value = 15), Wood (Value = 8), and Wheat (Value = 6).\n\nAfter the last trade, we have 8 Ore, which is a significant holding in the most valuable resource. We should look to maintain or increase our holdings in Ore or Brick if possible.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n\nGiven our current holdings and the goal to increase total value, let's analyze potential trades:\n\n1. We have a decent amount of Wheat (17) but it's one of the least valuable resources. Trading some Wheat for a more valuable resource could be beneficial.\n2. We have reduced our Wood to 11. Trading some Wood for a more valuable resource could also be considered, but we need to be cautious as reducing our Wood quantity further might not be ideal if we don't get a significantly more valuable resource in return.\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat for Brick or Ore, as both are more valuable than Wheat.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nLet's make an offer: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`.\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 1 Brick, 0 Ore]`\n\nIn the required format, the offer is: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`",

Player 1 accepted it.\n   - Your total value before this trade: (17*6) + (15*8) + (6*15) + (7*21) + (7*36) = 102 + 120 + 90 + 147 + 252 = 711\n   - Your total value after this trade: (17*6) + (11*8) + (6*15) + (7*21) + (8*36) = 102 + 88 + 90 + 147 + 288 = 715 (Increased by 4)\n3. **Third Offer (Accepted)**: You offered 3 Wheat for 1 Brick. Player 1 accepted it.\n   - Your total value before this trade: 715\n   - Your total value after this trade: (14*6) + (11*8) + (6*15) + (8*21) + (8*36) = 84 + 88 + 90 + 168 + 288 = 718 (Increased by 3)\n4. **Fourth Offer (Accepted)**: You offered 3 Wheat for 1 Ore. Player 1 accepted it.\n   - Your total value before this trade: 718\n   - Your total value after this trade: (11*6) + (11*8) + (6*15) + (8*21) + (9*36) = 66 + 88 + 90 + 168 + 324 = 736 (Increased by 18)\n\n### Next Action\n\nAfter analyzing the previous trades, it's clear that Player 1 is willing to accept your offers for certain resources. You've successfully increased your total value from 711 to 775. To continue this trend, let's consider making another offer.\n\nYou have 11 Wheat, which is valued at 6. You have already successfully traded Wheat for both Brick and Ore. Let's try to trade Wheat for another Ore since it has the highest value.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n\nYou have 11 Wheat left. Let's offer 2 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n\n`[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis trade would result in:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 14 - 2 = 12\n- [Ore]     Qty: 9 + 1 = 10\n\nLet's calculate the new total value if this trade is accepted:\n- [Wheat]   Total Value: 12 * 6 = 72\n- [Wood]    Total Value: 11 * 8 = 88\n- [Sheep]   Total Value: 6 * 15 = 90\n- [Brick]   Total Value: 9 * 21 = 189\n- [Ore]     Total Value: 10 * 36 = 360\n\nNew Total Value = 72 + 88 + 90 + 189 + 360 = 799\n\nThis trade is potentially beneficial as it increases your total value.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 2 Wheat, -> 1 Ore]`",
