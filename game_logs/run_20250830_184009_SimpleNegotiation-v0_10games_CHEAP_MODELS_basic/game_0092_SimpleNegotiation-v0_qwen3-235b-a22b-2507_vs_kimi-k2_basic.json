My last proposal (4 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore, i.e., same exact rate) was rejected; therefore, they probably value Ore more highly than that rate suggests.\n\nHowever, I can still profit slightly at that exchange, because  \nvalue(Ore)\u2003= 37 \u2192 1 Ore = 37 points  \nvalue(Sheep) = 17 \u2192 2 Sheep = 34 points  \n\nSo for me every \u201c1 Ore for 2 Sheep\u201d trade has a net gain of +3 points.
