      "response": "Given the history of rejections, Player 1 seems to value Brick highly or has limited supply, making them unwilling to part with it for Sheep or Wood. To increase my total resource value, I must propose a trade that appears more attractive to Player 1, potentially targeting a resource they may undervalue or have in surplus. Wheat is my lowest-value resource (6 per unit), and I haven't offered it yet. Trading Wheat for a higher-value resource like Ore (35 per unit) could benefit me if the exchange rate is favorable. However, to make it appealing, I need to offer enough Wheat to offset their potential loss in vest value, assuming they might have a surplus of Ore or undervalue it.\n\nPrevious offers like Wood for Brick were rejected, so I shift focus. I propose offering a bundle of Wheat for Ore, ensuring my net gain while giving Player 1 a perceived advantage or addressing their needs.\n\n**New Offer:**  \nI offer 7 Wheat (my total Wheat, valued at 6 \u00d7 7 = 42) for 2 Ore (valued at 35 \u00d7 2 = 70).  \n- My perspective: Gain 70, lose 42 \u2192 net +28.  \n- Player 1's perspective: Gains 42 in Wheat, loses 70 in Ore \u2192 net -28.  \n\nThough this seems lopsided against Player 1, it might incentivize acceptance if:  \n- They severely undervalue Ore (e.g., having excess) or overvalue Wheat (needing it urgently).  \n- A large bundle appears more tempting, especially for a resource they might not need.  \n\nThis leverages my low-value Wheat to target a high-value resource, optimizing profit given the risk of rejection.  \n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",
