Looking at the valuations:\n\nHighest value resources in my hand: Ore (38) > Brick (22) > Sheep (18) > Wood (9) > Wheat (6)\n\nThis suggests:\n1. Wheat and Wood are comparatively \u201clow-value\u201d for me.\n2. I would like MORE Ore or Brick, not less.\n3. Sheep is valuable too, so unless it\u2019s profitable, keep them.\n\nGoal: offload low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) while acquiring high-value ones (Ore, Brick), or at least break even in value or higher.\n\nLet\u2019s craft a new offer that helps me. I\u2019ll propose giving away my cheaper resources (Wheat, Wood) in exchange for high-value ones (Ore, Brick). I don\u2019t need to give Sheep as they\u2019re mid-tier and valuable.\n\nNew potential offer:\n- Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood\n- Request: 2 Ore, 3 Brick\n\nValue check for me:\n- Giving: 5\u00d76 + 5\u00d79 = 30 + 45 = 75\n- Receiving: 2\u00d738 + 3\u00d722 = 76 + 66 = 142\nNet gain for me: +67 value, huge upside.\nNeed to ensure their acceptance likelihood\u2014this is very asymmetric, but it could be palatable if they need wheat/wood badly. Sometimes opening a strong ask gives room.\n\nAlternatively, a fairer split with equal value exchange:\nLet me calculate exact equal value trade:\nI want Brick: 22/6 \u2248 3.7 wheat per 1 brick, or 22/9 \u2248 2.45 wood per 1 brick.\n\nExact 1 Brick for 4 Wheat \u2248 22 vs 24 ~ close; could offer 4 wheat \u2192 1 brick (I slightly lose 2 value) but gains later.\n\nBalance: Want to keep roughly break-even or gain per trade step.\n\nLet\u2019s be moderate for better chance:\nOffer: 4 Wheat \u2192 2 Brick (I give 24 value, get 44 value, +20). Seems generous to them but not crazy.\n\nWait to maximize gains carefully, I go back to strong ask.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 2 Ore, 3 Brick]",
