      "response": "Thought process:\n\n1. **Evaluate Current Holdings**: \n   - Wheat (25 units, value 5 each) = 125 total value\n   - Wood (11 units, value 10 each) = 110 total value\n   - Sheep (6 units, value 16 each) = 96 total value\n   - Brick (14 units, value 30 each) = 420 total value\n   - Ore (15 units, value 33 each) = 495 total value\n   - **Total current value**: 125 + 110 + 96 + 420 + 495 = 1,246\n\n2. **Analyze Player 1's Offer**: \n   - Player 1 offers 1 Brick (value 30) for 2 Ore (value 33 each = 66 total).\n   - This is a bad deal because you're giving away 66 value for 30, resulting in a net loss of 36 value.\n\n3. **Strategy for Next Turn**: \n   - Since Player 1 has rejected all your Wheat-for-Brick offers, they're clearly not interested in Wheat. Now that they've proposed Brick-for-Ore, they likely value Brick more than Ore, so they might not be interested in your Ore-for-Brick trade in the future.\n   - To increase your total value, you might need to seek trades that give you higher-value resources (Ore or Brick) by giving away lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep).\n   - Consider offering Sheep (value 16) or Wood (value 10) for Brick or Ore, as this could be more appealing to Player 1.\n\n4. **Next Offer**: \n   - Since Player 1 values Brick highly (as shown by their offer), they likely are low on Brick or want more. Offer them something else they might value more, like Sheep. For example:\n     - Offer 2 Sheep (32 value) for 1 Brick (30 value). This is a net loss of 2 value, but might be acceptable if Player 1 is desperate for Sheep. Alternatively, try 1 Sheep for 1 Brick (they would gain 14 value, so it's unlikely). Perhaps better to offer multiple Sheep for 1 Brick (e.g., 3 Sheep for 1 Brick, 48 vs 30 value loss of 18 might be too much). Alternatively, try Wood + Sheep for Brick.\n\n5. **Final Decision**: \n   - A reasonable and likely acceptable offer is 2 Sheep for 1 Brick. This shows willingness to trade higher-value resources for Brick, which Player 1 seems to want.\n\nAnswer: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",
