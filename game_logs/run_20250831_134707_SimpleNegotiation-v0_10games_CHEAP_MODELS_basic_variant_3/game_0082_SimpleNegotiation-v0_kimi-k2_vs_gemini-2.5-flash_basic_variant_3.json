      "response": "Let me first compute my current total value, then decide what trades would improve it.\n\nCurrent holdings & values:\n- Wheat: 7 \u00d7 6 = 42\n- Wood: 16 \u00d7 9 = 144\n- Sheep: 5 \u00d7 17 = 85\n- Brick: 8 \u00d7 30 = 240\n- Ore: 7 \u00d7 34 = 238\n\nTotal value = 42 + 144 + 85 + 240 + 238 = 749.\n\nA simple heuristic in this game is to improve your average value per unit of each resource.  \nLooking at those averages:\n\n- Wheat: 6 (lowest value)\n- Wood: 9\n- Sheep: 17\n- Brick: 30\n- Ore: 34 (highest value)\n\nSo my surplus/low-value resources are Wheat and Wood. The ones I \u201cwant more\u201d of are Brick and Ore because they have the highest marginal value.\n\nI have only 7 Ore, which is limiting\u2014so grabbing a few more Ores would likely raise my total value fastest. I also have 16 Wood, which gives me plenty to spare for trades.  \nI\u2019d like to trade away Wheat + Wood for Brick + Ore.\n\nA fair rule-of-thumb is to keep relative marginal value roughly the same, so the exchange must be weighted toward the higher-valued resources.  \nLet me propose an opening bargain: I\u2019ll give 3 Wheat + 2 Wood (total value 18+18 = 36) for 3 Ore + 1 Brick (total value 34+30 = 64).
