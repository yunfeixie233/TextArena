Let's look at my resources:\n   - I have high quantities of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep but relatively low quantities of Brick and Ore. Brick and Ore have the highest values, so acquiring more of them is beneficial.\n   - My last offer (4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick) was denied. This was a good trade (value given: 4*6 + 2*11 = 24 + 22 = 46; value received: 3*24 = 72; net gain of 26), but Player 1 denied it, likely because they valued Brick highly too.\n   - I could try a different offer, perhaps offering Sheep or Ore (which have higher values) in exchange for Brick or Ore. However, giving up Ore is risky because it has the highest value.\n\n5. **Alternative Offer**: Let's try offering Sheep for Brick, since Sheep is less valuable to me (14 vs. Brick's 24). \n   - For example, offering 3 Sheep for 2 Brick:\n     - Value given: 3 * 14 = 42\n     - Value received: 2 * 24 = 48\n     - Net gain: 6\n   - This is a slight gain and may be more acceptable to Player 1.\n\n6. **Final Decision**: I will deny the incoming offer and make a new offer.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",
