      "response": "Okay, I have read the instructions carefully. I understand my goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I will use the specified action tokens.\n\nMy current resources:\n*   **Wheat**: 10 (Value: 60)\n*   **Wood**: 8 (Value: 80)\n*   **Sheep**: 9 (Value: 135)\n*   **Brick**: 20 (Value: 400)\n*   **Ore**: 20 (Value: 800)\nTotal Value: 1475.\n\nMy previous offer was \"2 Wood -> 1 Ore\". This was rejected. The value of 2 Wood is 20, and 1 Ore is 40. This was a 1:2 value trade in my favor (I gain 20 value). It's understandable why Player 1 rejected it. They received no offer from Player 1.\n\nI need to make a new offer that is more appealing, but still in my favor.\nLet's analyze my resources and what I might want to obtain. Ore is high value, and I have a good quantity. Brick is also good. Wood and Wheat are lower value. Sheep is mid-value.\n\nI want to convert lower value items to higher value items.\nI have a lot of Brick and Ore. I'm okay trading some if the return is good.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again, as it's the highest value.\nWhat if I offer something with closer value, but still in my favor?\nPlayer 1 rejected \"2 Wood (20) -> 1 Ore (40)\". They probably want something with higher resource value or closer monetary value.\n\nMaybe I can offer something they might value more, even if it has a higher nominal value for me, if I think I can get a better return over time or if it helps me rebalance.\n\nWhat about trading Sheep or Wood for Ore?\nLet's try to get more high-value items for my less valuable items.\nMy last offer was too greedy. I need to make a more balanced offer, but still advantageous.\n\nConsider offering some Brick for Ore. Brick has a value of 20, Ore has a value of 40.\nIf I offer 1 Brick (20) for 1 Ore (40), it's a good trade for me, but maybe too greedy again.\nIf I offer 2 Brick (40) for 1 Ore (40), it's a 1:1 value trade. I don't gain value, but I convert a higher quantity lower-value item to a lower quantity higher-value item. This could still be good if I can then leverage the Ore.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again. Player 1 might be short on Ore, or want to consolidate.\nWhat if I offer a mix of lower value items?\n\n2 Wood (20) + 1 Wheat (6) = 26 value. Requesting 1 Ore (40). Still too much in my favor maybe.\n3 Wood (30) + 1 Wheat (6) = 36 value. Requesting 1 Ore (40). This is closer. I gain 4 value.\nThis is a small gain, but better than being rejected.\n\nLet's try this. It's less aggressive than my last offer, making it more likely to be accepted.\n\nMy current resource stats:\nWheat: 10 (60)\nWood: 8 (80)\nSheep: 9 (135)\nBrick: 20 (400)\nOre: 20 (800)\n\nI'll offer 3 Wood and 1 Wheat for 1 Ore.\nValue offered: (3 * 10) + (1 * 6) = 30 + 6 = 36.\nValue requested: 1 * 40 = 40.\nNet gain for me: 40 - 36 = 4. This is a small gain, but I also consolidate resources into a higher value type.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
