I have a good quantity of Ore (7), which has a high value at 34.\n2. Brick (5) has a relatively lower quantity but high value (25).\n3. My quantity of Wood is now low (6), and I should focus on maximizing its value.\n\n**Proposed Trade Offer:**\n- Given the current scenario, I propose the following trade:\n\n**[Offer: 3 Brick, 2 Wheat -> 4 Wood, 1 Sheep]**\n\nThis way, I'm offering resources of value that might be attractive for Player 1, in exchange for Wood that I need to build up my resource quantity. \n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds to this offer!",
