      "response": "To start, I will analyze the resources I have and their values:\n\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 23   Value: 6   Total Value: 23 * 6 = 138\n- [Wood]    Qty: 10   Value: 9   Total Value: 10 * 9 = 90\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 6    Value: 17  Total Value: 6 * 17 = 102\n- [Brick]   Qty: 6    Value: 21  Total Value: 6 * 21 = 126\n- [Ore]     Qty: 19   Value: 39  Total Value: 19 * 39 = 741\n\nTotal value of my resources = 138 + 90 + 102 + 126 + 741 = 1197\n\nFirst, I will look for opportunities to trade resources of lower value for resources of higher value or to consolidate resources that are more valuable.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Potential Trades\nTo increase the total value, I should try to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values. My resources with the lowest values are Wheat (Value: 6) and Wood (Value: 9). I should consider offering these for more valuable resources.\n\n## Step 2: Formulate a Trade Offer\nLet's consider offering Wheat, which is one of my abundant resources but has a low value, in exchange for something more valuable. Since Ore is the most valuable resource, I'll try to get more Ore or maintain my Ore quantity while acquiring other valuable resources.\n\n## Step 3: Create the First Trade Offer\nI'll offer 10 Wheat (Value: 10 * 6 = 60) for 1 Ore (Value: 39). Although this seems like I'm losing value (60 vs 39), it's a starting point to initiate trade. However, I should adjust my strategy to be more sensible.\n\n## Step 4: Adjust the Trade Offer\nLet's adjust the offer to be more reasonable. I have a surplus of Wheat, so offering some Wheat for a less valuable resource that I lack or need more of could be a good start. For example, offering Wheat for Brick or Sheep could be a viable strategy since I don't have a lot of those.\n\n## Step 5: Make the Initial Offer\nI'll make an offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`. This offer is `[Offer: 5 Wheat (Value: 5*6 = 30) -> 1 Brick (Value: 21)]`. Although the value isn't directly gained, acquiring Brick can be useful.\n\n## Turn 1 Action:\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.",

      "response": "### Current State of Resources\n\nAfter the last trade, the state of your resources is as follows:\n\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 20   Value: 6\n- [Wood]    Qty: 9    Value: 9\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 6    Value: 17\n- [Brick]   Qty: 7    Value: 21\n- [Ore]     Qty: 20   Value: 39\n\n### Analysis of Previous Trades\n\n1. You initially offered 5 Wheat for 1 Brick, which was rejected.\n2. You then reduced the offer to 4 Wheat for 1 Brick, which was also rejected.\n3. Further reducing the offer to 2 Wheat for 1 Brick resulted in another rejection.\n4. You accepted an offer from Player 1: 1 Ore for 1 Brick and 1 Wood.\n5. You rejected an offer from Player 1: 2 Ore for 3 Brick and 1 Wheat.\n6. Your latest offer of 3 Wheat for 1 Brick was rejected.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\n\nGiven that your offers for Brick in exchange for Wheat have been consistently rejected, it might be time to consider alternative trades or adjust your offer. Since you've successfully traded for Brick and lost some Wood in the process, you should evaluate the current resource values and consider what would be a beneficial trade.\n\n### Potential Trade\n\nLet's examine the values:\n- You have 20 Wheat (Value: 6), 9 Wood (Value: 9), 6 Sheep (Value: 17), 7 Brick (Value: 21), and 20 Ore (Value: 39).\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some of your less valuable resources for more valuable ones or consolidating resources that are more valuable.\n\n### Proposed Action for Turn 8\n\nConsidering the current state and the goal to increase the total value of resources, let's propose a trade that could be beneficial.\n\nYou have a significant amount of Ore (Value: 39) and Wheat (Value: 6). Offering some Wheat for a more valuable resource could be a good strategy. However, given that previous attempts to trade Wheat for Brick were not successful, let's consider an alternative.\n\nOne possible trade is to offer some Wheat for Sheep or Wood, as these are relatively less valuable than Brick or Ore but more valuable than Wheat.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nLet's make an offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`.\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 1 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore]`\n\nIn the required format, this is: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`.",
