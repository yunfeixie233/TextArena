      "response": "I will first estimate the total pre-trade asset value, then isolate the resource whose expected post-trade value lies furthest below its intrinsic value.

Conversely, Brick is probably what the opponent wants most. My surplus low-value items are Wheat and Wood. My best general strategy is therefore:\n\n(a) Never trade away Brick.  \n(b) Never trade away Ore unless the per-unit value received is \u226534 (i.e., basically never).  \n(c) Be willing to \u201ctrade up\u201d Sheep or Wheat/Wood into someone else\u2019s Ore or Brick if the rate is mildly favorable.  \n\nTurn 1\n\nI open with a low-value, wide-margin offer to see the opponent\u2019s stance without risking high-value resources.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wood, 12 Wheat \u2192 4 Sheep]",
