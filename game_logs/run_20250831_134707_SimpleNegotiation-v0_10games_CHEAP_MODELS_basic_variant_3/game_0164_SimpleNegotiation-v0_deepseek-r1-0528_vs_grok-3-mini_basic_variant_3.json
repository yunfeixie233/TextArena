This reduces my total value, so accepting wouldn't help my goal.  \n\nInstead, I propose a counter-offer: **1 Brick for 2 Sheep**.  \n- **My valuation**: Giving 1 Brick (27) for 2 Sheep (32) nets a **+5 gain** in value.  \n- **Why this works for me**: Brick is less valuable *to me* than Sheep per unit (Brick: 27, Sheep: 16). Trading 27 for 32 increases my total value.  \n- **Why Player 1 might accept**: Player 1 has consistently offered Sheep for Brick/Ore (e.g., earlier offers like 2 Sheep for 1 Ore), signaling they prioritize these resources. This offer uses Brick, which they seem to want, at a favorable ratio from their perspective.  \n\nGiven repeated rejections of Wheat/Wood trades, I focus on Brick\u2013Sheep exchanges for efficiency.
