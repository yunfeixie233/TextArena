By taking the deal I demonstrate willingness to compromise, which should encourage Player 0 to keep talking and perhaps now reciprocate with better trades.  \n3. Losing six Wood (value 12 each) is tolerable: I still have 15 Wood left (the second most among my resources), and gaining two Brick increases a scarcer resource I need for future builds.  \n4. Ore remains untouched, so I still control my most valuable bargaining chip for later turns.\n\nMy updated inventory:\n\n* Wheat 11 (5)  \n* Wood 15 (12)  \n* Sheep 18 (16)  \n* Brick 11 (22)  \n* Ore 5 (40)\n\nNext turn I will try to flip the script and ask Player 0 to give me Ore in exchange for a moderate pile of Wheat/Wood/Sheep.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat, 4 Wood, 5 Sheep -> 3 Ore]",
