Let's analyze your situation and refine your strategy moving forward. Here\u2019s a summary of your resources after the first offer and trade:\n\n### Current Resources:\n- **Wheat**: 18 (after giving away 5)\n- **Wood**: 18\n- **Sheep**: 7 (after giving away 5)\n- **Brick**: 2 (after receiving 2)\n- **Ore**: 13 (after receiving 1)\n\n### Total Values:\n- Wheat: 18 * 5 = 90\n- Wood: 18 * 11 = 198\n- Sheep: 7 * 14 = 98\n- Brick: 2 * 24 = 48\n- Ore: 13 * 35 = 455\n- **Total Value**: 889\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward:\n1. **Propose Offers with Better Value Exchange**: Since Player 1 is rejecting lower-value offers, aim for trades that provide them with equal or greater value while also giving you a substantial return. \n2. **Target Valuable Resources**: Aim to acquire more Brick and Ore, as they have higher value.\n3. **Utilize Compelling Combinations**: Consider offers that combine offerings from multiple resources to create perceived higher value.\n\n### Next Offer:\nConsidering your current resources, let's make a more enticing offer to Player 1. Here\u2019s a potential offer you could propose:\n\n'[Offer: 3 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 2 Brick, 2 Ore]'\n\nThis offer uses excess resources and gives them options that might be appealing. You are aiming to get Brick and Ore, which can greatly increase your total resource value in the next rounds. \n\nMake the offer and see how Player 1 responds.",
