(39 value for 27 value) - good for me, bad for opponent.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nIf I offer Sheep for Ore.\n1 Ore (39) vs 3 Sheep (39). This is a fair trade by value. I have plenty of Sheep, and need Ore.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore] This is a 1:1 value trade (39 vs 39). This is highly profitable in terms of increasing my Ore quantity.\n\nAnother option: trade bricks for wood. 2 brick (54) for 5 wood (55). I have a lot of bricks and little wood. This increases my wood count.\n\nLet's try to get more desirable resources. Ore is the most valuable per unit.\n\nMy current resources:\nWheat: 8 (40)\nWood: 8 (88)\nSheep: 21 (273)\nBrick: 26 (702)\nOre: 5 (195)\nTotal: 1298\n\nLast trade increased my value.\nI will propose to exchange Sheep for Ore, as I have an abundance of Sheep.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
