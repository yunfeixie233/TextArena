      "response": "Let me assess what has happened and what the current position is before deciding on the best next move.\n\nMy present holdings (after the trade where I gave 3 Ore for 8 Wheat and 5 Wood):\n\n- Wheat: 14 + 8 = 22\n- Wood: 21 + 5 = 26\n- Sheep: 17\n- Brick: 19\n- Ore: 16 - 3 = 13\n\nValues per unit are:\n- Wheat: 5\n- Wood: 8\n- Sheep: 15\n- Brick: 22\n- Ore: 37 \u2014 so Ore is my highest-value resource.\n\nPlayer 1 just made a very expensive ask: 10 Wheat (50 units of value) + 5 Wood (40 units) = 90 units total in exchange for 4 Ore (148 units).  \nThat is roughly 1\u00bd-to-1 against me. Declining is easy.\n\nBecause Ore is so valuable to me I should not give it away for low-value Wheat & Wood, but I am open to acquiring more Ore if possible or swapping high-value-for-me Brick (22) for other things I value less.\n\nSince Player 1 seems to want Ore badly, let me test if they\u2019ll take a smaller Ore offer that still gives me a value bump.  \nMy lowest-value surplus is Wheat (5), so I can safely give some up. Brick is also in demand; Player 1 has rejected earlier Brick requests, but they may still consider Ore attractive.\n\nI\u2019ll send an offer that is light on both Ore and high-value Brick, yet still generous on my side.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick, 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore]",
