Since [Wheat] is my lowest value resource, getting rid of it for something more valuable is a good start.\n   - Let's offer 5 [Wheat] for 1 [Ore] since 1 [Ore] = 34, which is significantly more valuable than 5 [Wheat] = 25.\n\n### First Turn Action\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis action aims to exchange lower-value resources for higher-value ones, directly increasing the total value of my resources.

You offered 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, but it was rejected.\n2. You then offered 4 Sheep for 1 Ore, which was accepted.\n\nLet's update the resources after the accepted trade:\n- Wheat: Qty: 10, Value: 5 (No change)\n- Wood: Qty: 22, Value: 12 (No change)\n- Sheep: Qty: 21 (25 - 4), Value: 13\n- Brick: Qty: 21, Value: 29 (No change)\n- Ore: Qty: 11 (10 + 1), Value: 34\n\nThe total value of your resources before the trade was: (10*5) + (22*12) + (25*13) + (21*29) + (10*34) = 50 + 264 + 325 + 609 + 340 = 1588\nAfter the trade: (10*5) + (22*12) + (21*13) + (21*29) + (11*34) = 50 + 264 + 273 + 609 + 374 = 1570\n\nIt seems there was a decrease in total value due to the trade, which isn't ideal. However, the goal is to increase the total value.\n\nYou then made another offer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore. This was rejected.\n\nLet's analyze this last offer:\n- You were offering 3 Wood (Value: 12 each) and 2 Sheep (Value: 13 each), totaling (3*12) + (2*13) = 36 + 26 = 62.\n- You were requesting 1 Ore (Value: 34).\n\nThis trade doesn't seem favorable as you're offering resources worth 62 for something worth 34.\n\nGiven the current situation and the fact that we are still in the early turns (Turn 3 or 4, depending on how the turns are counted), it's essential to reconsider the trades and the resources' values.\n\n### Current Resources:\n- Wheat: Qty: 10\n- Wood: Qty: 22\n- Sheep: Qty: 19 (21 - 2)\n- Brick: Qty: 21\n- Ore: Qty: 11\n\nTo proceed, let's make a new offer that could potentially increase the total value.\n\n### Potential Trade:\nTo simplify, let's directly consider a trade that could be beneficial.\n\nConsidering the last rejected offer and the resources available, we could look for alternatives that are more balanced or beneficial.\n\nOne potential strategy is to offer resources of lower value for ones of higher value.

Given that Wheat has a low value, it's not surprising that the offer was rejected.\n   - The offer of 4 Sheep for 1 Ore was accepted. This indicates that Player 1 is interested in Sheep.\n   - The subsequent offer of 3 Wood and 2 Sheep for 1 Ore was rejected. This could indicate that Player 1 either doesn't need more Ore or doesn't want to give more Ore, or the offered resources were not valuable enough.\n   - The offer of 5 Wheat for 1 Brick was rejected. Given Wheat's low value, it's reasonable that Player 1 didn't accept.\n\n3. **Strategy for the Next Turn**:\n   - Since Player 1 accepted the trade involving Sheep, we should consider offering Sheep again but possibly adjust the requested resource based on the current holdings and values.\n   - Given that Ore is highly valued and we've successfully obtained some by offering Sheep, we should continue to leverage Sheep if possible.\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nLet's make an offer that involves Sheep again since it was successful previously:\n- Offered items: 3 Sheep\n- Requested items: 1 Brick (since Brick is valuable and we haven't obtained it yet through trades)\n\nThe proposed trade offer is: `[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis action is represented as: `[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick]`\n\n### Output\n`[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick]`",
