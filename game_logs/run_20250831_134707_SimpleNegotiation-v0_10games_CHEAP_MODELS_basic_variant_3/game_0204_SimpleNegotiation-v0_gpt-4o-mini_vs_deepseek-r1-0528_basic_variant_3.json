Evaluate potential trades based on resource surplus or shortages.\n2. Focus on acquiring resources that can significantly increase total value or are in short supply.\n\nSince Player 1 made an offer for 3 Sheep in exchange for 1 Brick, Player 0 should consider if they can enhance their position by counter-offering for a better trade.\n\n**Making a New Trade Offer:**\nI will make an offer to Player 1 for 3 Sheep in exchange for 1 Brick and 2 Ore, as I need those resources for my increase in value.\n\n**My Offer:**\n'[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 2 Ore]' \n\nThis will allow me to replenish some of my Brick while acquiring Ore beneficial for future trades or resources.",
