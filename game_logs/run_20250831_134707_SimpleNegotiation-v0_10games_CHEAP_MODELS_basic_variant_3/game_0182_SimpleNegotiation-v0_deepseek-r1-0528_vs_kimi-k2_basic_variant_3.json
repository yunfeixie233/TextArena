      "response": "Player 1, it looks like we've had some productive trades so far, especially the last one where we exchanged 5 Wood and 1 Sheep for 1 Ore and 1 Brick. That was mutually beneficial! I'm hoping to continue that pattern. Since I'm still looking to offload some lower-value resources, I'd like to propose the same deal again. It worked well for both of us last time\u2014I get more of the high-value Ore and Brick for building, and you get the Wood and Sheep you might need for settlements or development. What do you think?\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",
