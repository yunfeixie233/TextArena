I understand the format for making offers and accepting/denying them. I also know the game lasts for 10 turns.\n\nCurrently, I have:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 14 Value: 5 (Total Value: 70)\n*   [Wood] Qty: 20 Value: 10 (Total Value: 200)\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 20 Value: 13 (Total Value: 260)\n*   [Brick] Qty: 21 Value: 29 (Total Value: 609)\n*   [Ore] Qty: 24 Value: 38 (Total Value: 912)\n\nTotal Value: 2051\n\nI need to evaluate the previous trade:\nPlayer 0 offered: 5 Sheep, 5 Wheat (Value: 5*13 + 5*5 = 65 + 25 = 90)\nPlayer 0 requested: 3 Ore, 2 Wood (Value: 3*38 + 2*10 = 114 + 20 = 134)\n\nI accepted this trade which means I gave away 5 Sheep and 5 Wheat, and received 3 Ore and 2 Wood.\nThis was a good trade for me, as I gave away 90 value and received 134 value. My total value increased by 44.\n\nNow my resources are:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 14 - 5 = 9 (Value: 5)\n*   [Wood] Qty: 20 + 2 = 22 (Value: 10)\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 20 - 5 = 15 (Value: 13)\n*   [Brick] Qty: 21 (Value: 29)\n*   [Ore] Qty: 24 + 3 = 27 (Value: 38)\n\nMy strategy will be to trade low-value resources for high-value resources. Ore (38) and Brick (29) are my most valuable resources. Wheat (5) and Wood (10) are my least valuable. Sheep (13) is in the middle.\n\nI have a lot of Ore and Wood, and a decent amount of Brick and Sheep. My Wheat quantity is quite low.\n\nI will try to get more high-value resources (like Ore or Brick) by offering lower-value resources.\nPlayer 0 seems willing to trade, and their previous offer was favorable.\n\nI'll try to offer a mix of lower-value items for a high-value item.\nLet's try to get more Ore or Brick.\n\nConsider: Offering Sheep and Wheat for Ore.\nPossible offer: 2 Sheep (2*13=26) + 3 Wheat (3*5=15) = 41 value\nRequest: 1 Ore (38 value). This would be advantageous for me.\nOr perhaps Brick directly.\n\nLet's try to get some Brick, as Player 0 might have excess after the previous trade.\nI have a good amount of Wood and Sheep.\n\nOffer: 3 Wood (30 value) + 2 Sheep (26 value) = 56 value\nRequest: 2 Brick (2*29 = 58 value)\nThis is a good offer for me. I'm swapping lower-value items for higher-value ones, and the value difference is positive for me.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",
