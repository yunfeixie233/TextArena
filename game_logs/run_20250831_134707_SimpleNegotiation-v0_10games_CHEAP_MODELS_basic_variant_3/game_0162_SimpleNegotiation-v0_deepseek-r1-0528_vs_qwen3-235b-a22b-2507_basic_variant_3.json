Sheep (value 16 each) and Brick (value 20 each) show a strong potential, but Player 1 may value Sheep lower or protect Brick. To explore alternatives, I'll test Ore exchanges since it\u2019s our highest-value resource (39 per unit). I\u2019ll offer Wheat and Wood, which are lower-value (5 and 11), hoping Player 1 is willing to part with Ore for a bulk quantity of resources. \n\n**Proposed Trade:**  \n- **My Offer:** 4 Wheat (4 \u00d7 5 = 20) + 1 Wood (1 \u00d7 11 = 11) \u2192 Total given: 31  \n- **Request:** 1 Ore (1 \u00d7 39 = 39) \u2192 Net gain: +8  \n\nThis keeps the offer simple and potentially appealing if Player 1 lacks Wheat/Wood.  \n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
