This is a very bad trade for me.\n\nI need to make an offer that increases my total resource value. I have a lot of Ore and Brick, which are high-value items, but also some Wheat and Wood which are lower value. I want to trade low-value items for high-value items, or trade some of my high-value items for even more high-value items such that the overall value increases.\n\nMy current resource quantities are high enough that I can afford to trade some quantities.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, if possible. Ore has the highest value.\n\nHow about I offer some of my cheaper resources (Wheat, Wood) for some more valuable ones? Or, offer some of my high-value resources for a greater value of other high-value resources.\n\nConsider an offer where I give some Brick and Wood for Ore.\nMy current goal is to only make trades that increase my total value.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore.\nI have a significant amount of Brick. Let's try offering Brick for Ore.\n\nOffer: 2 Brick (2 * 26 = 52 value) for 2 Ore (2 * 40 = 80 value).\nThis would increase my value by 28. It's a plausible trade as Player 0 might need Brick if they have offered it before.\n\nLet's try a different trade, maybe involving Wood or Wheat.\nPlayer 0 previously offered Wood and Wheat. Perhaps they are trying to get rid of them.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore for 2 Brick and 1 Sheep?\nValue offered by me: 1 Ore (40)\nValue requested by me: 2 Brick (52) + 1 Sheep (13) = 65\nMy gain: 25. This is a good trade for me, but maybe too much for Player 0 to accept considering their previous offer.\n\nLet's make a more balanced offer, but still beneficial to me.\nPlayer 0 rejected my previous offer involving expensive items. Let's try something with items they offered before.\n\nPlayer 0 tried to offer Wood and Wheat. They might have an abundance of these.\nBut they asked for Ore and Brick.\n\nLet's offer some of my cheaper items for some of their more valuable ones (Ore or Brick).\n\nCurrent total value of my resources:\n(15 * 6) + (20 * 9) + (17 * 13) + (21 * 26) + (24 * 40)\n90 + 180 + 221 + 546 + 960 = 1997\n\nI want to increase this value.\n\nHow about offering some of my Wood and Wheat for Brick?\nOffer: 5 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 3 Brick\nValue offered by me: (5 * 9) + (5 * 6) = 45 + 30 = 75\nValue requested by me: (3 * 26) = 78\nMy gain: 3. This is a small gain, but it moves low-value items for higher-value ones.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nWhat if I offer some Wood and Brick for Ore?\nOffer: 3 Brick, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore\nValue offered by me: (3 * 26) + (2 * 9) = 78 + 18 = 96\nValue requested by me: (2 * 40) = 80\nThis is a loss of 16 for me. No.\n\nLet's make an offer involving items Player 0 offered to *me* previously. Player 0 offered Wood and Wheat.\nI have plenty of Ore and Brick. I want to trade these effectively.\n\nPlayer 0's last rejected offer was 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep. This was a bad offer for Player 0 as the value offered was higher than requested. Maybe they are desperate for Brick.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore using some of my Brick, but ensure I gain value.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nValue of 2 Brick = 2 * 26 = 52\nValue of 1 Ore = 1 * 40 = 40\nThis is a loss of 12 for me. Not good.\n\nWhat about a trade where I offer low value for high value?\nI have plenty of Wood and Wheat. Player 0 offered 4 Wood, 3 Wheat. So they have these.\n\nLet's try to exchange some of my Sheep for Ore.\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue of 2 Sheep = 2 * 13 = 26\nValue of 1 Ore = 1 * 40 = 40\nMy gain: 14. This is a good trade for me, and Player 0 could value Sheep less than Ore.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
