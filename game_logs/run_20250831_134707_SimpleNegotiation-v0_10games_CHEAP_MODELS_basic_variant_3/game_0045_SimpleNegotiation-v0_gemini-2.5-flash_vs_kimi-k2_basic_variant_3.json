My goal is to increase the total value.\n\nPlayer 1 accepted my previous trade, which means they are willing to trade. I made a bad trade for myself. I need to get more value than I give.\nThe relative values are: Wheat (5), Wood (11), Sheep (16), Brick (20), Ore (37).\n\nLet's try to trade away some lower-value items for higher-value items.\nI have a decent supply of Wheat, Wood, Sheep, and Brick. Ore is my most valuable resource, but I only have 8; it would be good to get more, or other high-value items.\n\nConsider what Player 1 might want. They accepted my last offer of Wheat and Wood. This suggests they might be short on those resources, or value them highly relative to Ore. Since Ore is valuable to me, I want to acquire it or other high-value items.\n\nOffer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore\nValue offered: (3 * 5) + (1 * 11) + (1 * 16) = 15 + 11 + 16 = 42\nValue requested: 1 * 37 = 37.

This is also a bad trade for me. I need to rethink my strategy.\n\nI need to offer less value and receive more value. It seems I am valuing my goods too lowly.\nInstead of thinking of it in absolute values, let's think in terms of ratios.\nOre (37)\nBrick (20)\nSheep (16)\nWood (11)\nWheat (5)\n\nWhat if I offer a lot of Wheat for something small? Or a lot of Wood?\n\nOffer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick\nValue offered: 5 * 5 = 25\nValue requested: 1 * 20 = 20. Still a loss for me.\n\nThis is difficult if I need to always increase my value.\nI need to be very aggressive in my trades.\n\nLet's offer a very low value item for a high value item.\nI have 10 Wheat.\n[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nValue offered: 7 * 5 = 35\nValue received: 1 * 20 = 20. Still a losing trade for me.\n\nI need to request more valuable items for less valuable items.\nMaybe I should focus on getting Ore, which is the most valuable.\n\nOffer: 3 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick\nValue offered: (3 * 11) + (3 * 16) = 33 + 48 = 81\nValue requested: 2 * 20 = 40. This is very bad.\n\nOkay, I'm finding it hard to create a profitable offer.\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nI have 15 Brick (value 20).\nPlayer 1 must value something I have more than I do.\n\nWhat if I offer a low value item and get a high value item?\n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 10 * 11 = 110\nValue requested: 1 * 37 = 37.\n\nThis is clearly not working. I need to make trades that are favorable to me, meaning the value I receive is greater than the value I offer.\n\nLet's try to trade one for one, or one for two.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Sheep, 1 Wood]\nValue offered: 1 * 20 = 20\nValue received: 1 * 16 + 1 * 11 = 27.\nThis is a profitable trade for me. I gain 7 value. I have plenty of Brick (15), so giving one up is fine.\nI'll try this.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Sheep, 1 Wood]",
