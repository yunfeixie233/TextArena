Losing 3 Sheep (valued ~2.67) offsets this partially, but the net gain is significant.  \n  - Sheep is abundant (18 units), so reducing quantity minimally affects my value.  \n- **For Player 1**:  \n  - If Brick is valuable to you, this provides more Ore (strategic resource) while moderately increasing Sheep. This trade preserves value and expands diversity.  \n\nThis trade balances our needs\u2014I consolidate resources I overvalue, while you gain resources you appear to prioritize based on earlier offers. \n\nWaiting for your response.
