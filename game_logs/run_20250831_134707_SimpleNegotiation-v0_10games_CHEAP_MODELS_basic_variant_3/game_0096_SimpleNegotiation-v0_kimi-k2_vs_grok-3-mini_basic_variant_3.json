Since Player 1 clearly likes Wood, I should see if I can extract more value.  \n   Wood is the cheapest resource I own (9). I have plenty (23). I want to convert some Wood into higher-value resources (Brick 25, Ore 39, Sheep 15) in a ratio that lifts my total.\n\n3. Designing a slightly better ratio for both sides:\n   - Give up 4 Wood (36 value).  \n   - Demand 1 Brick and 1 Sheep (25 + 15 = 40 value).  \n   Gives me +4 value net and only requires 4 Wood instead of 5.  \n   Player 1 values Wood higher than I do, so this might still look attractive to them.\n\n4.
