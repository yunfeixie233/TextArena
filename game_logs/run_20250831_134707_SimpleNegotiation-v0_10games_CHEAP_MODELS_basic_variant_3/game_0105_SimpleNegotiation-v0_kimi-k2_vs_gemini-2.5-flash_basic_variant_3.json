This is why I'm trying to acquire more Brick.\n2. **Ore is the next most valuable (32)**, and I have a lot (16). I might be able to trade some Ore for Brick if needed.\n3. **Wheat is the least valuable (6)**, and I have the most (23). This is likely why I've been offering Wheat in trades\u2014it's expendable.\n4. **Previous Offers:**\n   - I've been consistently offering Wheat and Wood for Brick, but they've all been rejected. The offers were:\n     - 5 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 6 Brick (total offered value: 5*6 + 3*11 = 63; requested: 6*25 = 150) \u2192 rejected\n     - 4 Wheat + 2 Wood \u2192 4 Brick (offered: 4*6 + 2*11 = 46; requested: 100) \u2192 rejected\n     - 5 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 4 Brick (offered: 63; requested: 100) \u2192 rejected\n     - 4 Wheat + 2 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick (offered: 4*6 + 2*17 = 58; requested: 75) \u2192 rejected\n     - 5 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 5 Brick (offered: 63; requested: 125) \u2192 rejected\n   - The issue is that the value I'm offering is significantly less than the value I'm asking for. My offers have been heavily in my favor, which is likely why they're rejected.\n\n### Strategy Adjustment:\nSince my offers have been rejected, I need to make more balanced or even slightly favorable offers for Player 1 to be willing to trade. \n\n**New Approach:**\n- Offer more valuable resources (like Ore or Sheep) instead of just Wheat/Wood.\n- Offer a fairer value exchange (e.g., offer value closer to or slightly above the requested value).\n- Maybe offer Ore for Brick, since Ore is valuable (32) and Brick is 25.\n\n**Possible New Offer:**\n- Offer: 2 Ore (64 value) \u2192 2 Brick (50 value). This is 64 vs 50, which is a +28% value for Player 1, making it more attractive.\n- Or: 1 Ore (32) + 1 Sheep (17) \u2192 2 Brick (50). This is 49 vs 50, almost equal.\n\n### Final Decision:\nI'll try offering a slightly above-value trade to Player 1 to entice them.\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",
