Ore is similarly valuable but I have plenty. I also have excess Wood and plenty Sheep that I can spare.\n\nNext turn is Turn 4. I will propose a slightly more generous trade that still improves my total value while giving Player 1 a better perceived rate than my last two attempts.\n\nAnalysis of the rejected bids  \n\u2013 My first bundle offer (6 Wheat 4 Wood \u2192 3 Brick 1 Ore) had an asking price of 3 brick (\u224884 value) for only 6 wheat (\u224830) + 4 wood (\u224832) = 62, perhaps too pricey for P1.  \n\u2013 My single-Wheat-for-single-Brick swap (15 value for 28) was similarly imbalanced.\n\nThis time I will give P1 more intrinsic value per brick so it is mutually beneficial: offer 5 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick.  \nThat\u2019s 5\u00d75 + 3\u00d78 = 49 value for 2\u00d728 = 56 value.  \nThe value gap (7) still favors P1 slightly. Importantly, from my viewpoint 49 of my lower-marginal-value resources (W and Wo) become 56 of my scarce high-value resource (Brick), still a net gain of +7 value to me.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]",
