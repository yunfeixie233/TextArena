Net value swing for P0 = +13.\nSo now, before Round 4:\nP0 inventory:\n- Wheat 21  (value 5)\n- Wood  12  (value 9)\n- Sheep  8  (value 17)\n- Brick  5  (value 28)\n- Ore   14  (value 39)\n\nP0\u2019s total portfolio value is 1 204.  \nBrick and Ore are both scarcer and exceptionally valuable relative to Wheat/Wood.  \nTherefore I still want to accumulate Brick and Ore at the expense of low-value Wheat/Wood.  \nCurrent open offers:\n\u2013 Last P1 offer: 4 Wheat 1 Wood for 3 Brick (P0 already denied, but the gap shows P1 wants Brick, something P0 should not give up cheaply.)\n\nPlan: offer Wheat/Wood for Ore or Brick at a *slightly worse* ratio than yesterday (since yesterday\u2019s 4 Wheat+2 Wood / 3 Sheep went through, they may still value Wood higher than I do).\n\nPossible util-loss-free \u201cfair-ish\u201d exchange:\nOffer 4 Wheat + 2 Wood (38 value) requesting 2 Ore (78 value).  \nThat\u2019s a value improvement of +40 for Player 0 if accepted.  \nIt encroaches only on the generics (Wheat/Wood) and keeps my Brick & Sheep untouched.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
