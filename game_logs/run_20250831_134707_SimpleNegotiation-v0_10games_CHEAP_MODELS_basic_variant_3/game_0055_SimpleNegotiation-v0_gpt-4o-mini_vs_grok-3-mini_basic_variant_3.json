      "response": "After analyzing the current game state and trade offers, here's the situation:\n\n**Current Resources and Values:**\n- Wheat: 16 @ 5\n- Wood: 6 @ 12\n- Sheep: 7 @ 16\n- Brick: 12 @ 27\n- Ore: 20 @ 34\n\n**Trade Offers Reviewed:**\n1. Accepted trade with Player 1: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Ore, 1 Brick\n2. Accepted trade with Player 1: 5 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick\n\n**Proposed Offer from Player 1:**\n- Offered: 2 Wheat, 4 Wood, 1 Sheep\n- Requested: 1 Ore, 1 Brick\n\n**Deciding Whether to Accept or Deny:**\n- Evaluate the offered resources versus the requested resources.\n- Current resources post trades:\n  - Wheat: 12 (after accepting previous offers)\n  - Wood: 1 (after accepting previous offers)\n  - Sheep: 6 (after accepting previous offers)\n  - Brick: 13 (after accepting previous offers)\n  - Ore: 18 (after accepting previous offers)\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Accepting this offer would result in:\n  - +1 Ore, +1 Brick\n  - Would decrease Wheat to 10 and Wood to -3 (not possible as I cannot go negative)\n\nThus, I cannot accept this offer because it would lead me to have negative resources in Wood, which is not a valid move.\n\nFollowing this evaluation:\n\n**Action:**\n[Denied]",
