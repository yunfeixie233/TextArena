It's a less favorable ratio for the opponent than my previous offer of 4 Wheat for 1 Wood, but still might be considered.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Wood]",

Given that I have been trying to get Wood and my previous offers were rejected, I should consider if this is a viable option.\n\nLet's analyze my need for resources and their values:\n- I have Wheat with a low value and have been trying to trade it for Wood, which is also relatively low in value but needed.\n- The offer from Player 1 is not favorable but continuing to negotiate for Wood is a priority.\n\nConsidering my current resources and the ongoing need to improve my total value, I will look for a better or more reasonable offer.\n\nSince the value exchange is not in my favor and I am not satisfied with the offer, my response will be to deny it.\n\n'[Deny]' is the default action, so I will stick with it for now and make a new offer.\n\nTo improve my resource value, I should continue trying to get a better deal for my resources. I still have Wheat that I can offer for Wood.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood]' is a reasonable next step as it continues my negotiation for Wood at a slightly better ratio than Player 1's last offer.\n\nMy action is: [Offer: 2 Wheat,  -> 1 Wood]",
