      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: Your current resources have the following per-unit values:  \n   - Wheat: 5 (lowest)  \n   - Wood: 11  \n   - Sheep: 18  \n   - Brick: 27  \n   - Ore: 33 (highest)  \n\n   This means Ore is your most valuable resource and should generally be acquired or retained. Conversely, Wheat is your least valuable\u2014trading away Wheat to gain higher-value resources is advantageous.\n\n2. **Abundance vs. Scarcity**: You have large quantities of Wood (25) and Ore (22), but only moderate shortages might develop depending on opponents' needs. However, since Ore has the highest unit value, preserving or increasing Ore is likely beneficial unless an exceptional trade arises.\n\n3. **Opportunity Cost of Trading**: When offering resources, prioritize those with the lowest value-to-quantity ratio. For example, Wheat (value 5) is abundant and low-value\u2014ideal to trade away. Wood (11) is moderately valuable but you have 25 units, so limited trading of Wood may be acceptable.\n\n4. **Trade Leverage and Relative Demand**: In negotiation games, value is subjective. Another player may value Sheep or Brick highly. Since Brick (27) and Ore (33) are high-value, other players may seek them. Use excess high-demand resources (e.g., Brick or Sheep) to request even higher-value returns.\n\n5. **Trade Efficiency**: Aim for trades where the total value gained exceeds the total value given. However, due to subjective player needs, even break-even or slightly negative trades may be justified if they enable future gains.\n\n6. **Avoid Redundant Gains**: For example, offering Sheep to get Sheep (as in the sample format) is generally poor unless part of a complex multi-trade\u2014rare and suspicious.\n\n7. **Proactive Offers**: Since you start with no incoming offers, initiating trade is essential. Target improving holdings in highest-value resources (Ore, Brick) by offering lower-value items (Wheat, Wood, or moderate Sheep).\n\n8. **Inventory Diversification**: Currently, you have all five resources. Avoid becoming unbalanced unless strategic.\n\n**Strategic Goal**: Increase total portfolio value by trading away low-value, abundant resources (especially Wheat) to acquire high-value resources (Ore, Brick).\n\nBest Trade Strategy:  \n- Offer: Wheat, possibly Wood or excess Sheep  \n- Request: Ore or Brick  \n\nYou have 12 Wheat (value 5)\u2014ideal to trade. Even 3 Wheat (~15 total value) can be used to gain 1 Ore (value 33) in a favorable trade.\n\nSample High-Value Trade:  \nOffer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood \u2192 1 Ore  \nThis gives up 5\u00d75 + 2\u00d711 = 25 + 22 = 47 value, gains 33. Slightly negative\u2014so avoid.\n\nBetter: Aim to receive more in value.\n\nIdeal: Offer low-value or medium resources, request high-value.  \nE.g., 5 Wheat (25) + 1 Wood (11) = 36 \u2192 1 Ore (33): close to neutral.\n\nBut since others may value Wheat less, offer larger amounts of low-value goods.  \nAlternatively, leverage Sheep (18) \u2014 higher than Wood, but if you have surplus, can trade 2 Sheep (36) for 1 Ore (33)\u2014slightly bad, but acceptable if Wheat or Wood is involved.\n\nBest approach: Bundle low-to-mid value resources to acquire Ore.\n\nDecide on a favorable offer.\n\nYou have:\n- Wheat: 12 \u2192 use up to 5\n- Wood: 25 \u2192 can part with 3\u20135\n- Sheep: 16 \u2192 can trade 1\u20133\n- Brick: 14 \u2192 high value, don\u2019t offer unless big return\n- Ore: 22 \u2192 highest value, never offer\n\nOptimal Offer Example:\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore]  \nValue given: 5\u00d75 + 3\u00d711 = 25 + 33 = 58  \nValue received: 2\u00d733 = 66  \nNet gain: +8 \u2192 favorable.\n\nBut may be too ambitious.\n\nMore realistic:\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]  \nGiven: 4\u00d75 = 20, 2\u00d711=22, 1\u00d718=18 \u2192 total 60  \nReceived: 1\u00d727 + 1\u00d733 = 60 \u2192 even\n\nFair, but acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps better to focus purely on acquiring Ore.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Ore]  \nValue out: 5\u00d75 + 4\u00d711 = 25 + 44 = 69  \nValue in: 3\u00d733 = 99  \nNet gain: +30\n\nHighly favorable if accepted.\n\nBut might be too generous on the offer side? No \u2014 you\u2019re giving low-value items, gaining high.\n\nHowever, Ore is also your strongest asset\u2014others may be reluctant to give 3 Ore.\n\nAdjust for realism:\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore]  \nOut: 6\u00d75=30, 3\u00d711=33 \u2192 63  \nIn: 2\u00d733=66 \u2192 gain 3\n\nMinimal gain, but improves portfolio.\n\nEven better: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore]  \nOut: 20 + 22 + 18 = 60  \nIn: 66 \u2192 gain 6\n\nGood.\n\nBut perhaps start with a simpler, aggressive yet fair offer.\n\nBest opening move:\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]  \nOut: 25 + 22 = 47  \nIn: 33 + 27 = 60 \u2192 gain 13\n\nHighly favorable.\n\nThis trade upgrades low-value Wheat and moderate Wood into top-tier resources.\n\nDecision:\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are crucial for maximizing value, especially in a finite game like this one with only 10 turns. First, **value assessment** is paramount: Always calculate the net value of a trade by comparing the total value of resources received against those given up, using your personal valuations to ensure you're gaining more than you're losing. This helps avoid unfavorable deals. Second, **resource abundance and scarcity** should guide decisions\u2014trade away resources you have in surplus for those that are more valuable or harder to obtain, but only if it results in a net gain. Third, **negotiation strategy** involves rejecting poor offers and considering counter-offers to improve terms, as accepting a bad deal early could limit future opportunities. Additionally, in a turn-based game, **focus on long-term sustainability** by prioritizing trades that build your portfolio without depleting high-value resources unnecessarily. Finally, **risk management** is key: If a trade doesn't immediately increase your total value, it's often wiser to deny it and wait for better proposals, as holding onto valuable assets can lead to stronger negotiations later. In my situation, with resources like Ore being highly valuable (37 value each), I must ensure any trade aligns with these principles to avoid net losses.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nApplying these principles to Player 0's offer\u2014where they propose giving me 5 Wheat (total value: 5 * 5 = 25) and 3 Wood (total value: 3 * 10 = 30), for a total incoming value of 55, in exchange for 2 Ore (total value: 2 * 37 = 74)\u2014results in a net loss of 74 - 55 = 19 value. This violates the core principle of value assessment, as it decreases my total resource value rather than increasing it. Additionally, considering resource abundance, I have 17 Ore, which is a high-value asset, and I'm not in dire need of Wheat or Wood based on my current holdings. There's no indication this trade addresses scarcity or sets me up for future gains, so denying it aligns with risk management and negotiation strategy. I'll hold out for a better offer that benefits me.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "Below, I'll follow the instructions step by step. First, I'll generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation based on my current situation. Then, I'll apply that knowledge to make my trading decision for this turn.\n\n### Generate Knowledge\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are particularly relevant to my situation as Player 1, where my goal is to increase the total value of my resources (currently Wheat: 12 qty, Wood: 13 qty, Sheep: 25 qty, Brick: 24 qty, and Ore: 17 qty, with values of 5, 10, 14, 23, and 37 respectively). \n\n- **Value Maximization Principle:** Always prioritize trades where the net value gained (value of resources received minus value of resources offered) is positive. This ensures long-term growth, especially in a limited-turn game like this one with only 10 turns. For instance, I should assess the absolute values of resources to avoid giving up high-value items (e.g., Ore at 37) for low-value ones (e.g., Wheat at 5).\n\n- **Abundance and Scarcity Strategy:** Trade resources I have in abundance or lower relative value (like Wheat and Wood, which I have plenty of and low values) for those that are scarcer or more valuable to me (like Ore, which has the highest value at 37). This leverages my surpluses while addressing gaps, but I must avoid depleting key resources prematurely.\n\n- **Negotiation Tactics:** Start with offers that are slightly favorable to me to test the other player's willingness, based on their past behavior. For example, Player 0 previously offered 5 Wheat and 3 Wood (total value: 55) for 2 Ore (total value: 74), indicating they value Ore highly and might be willing to accept trades that are neutral or slightly unbalanced in their favor. However, I should avoid over-revealing my needs and aim for incremental gains to build leverage over multiple turns.\n\n- **Risk Management Insight:** In a short game (10 turns), be proactive but cautious\u2014make offers that provide immediate value gains without risking essential resources. Reject or counter low-value offers, as I did previously, and use historical data (e.g., Player 0's rejected offer) to inform realistic expectations, aiming for mutual benefit to encourage future trades.\n\nThese principles help me focus on sustainable gains while adapting to the competitive dynamics.\n\n### Apply Knowledge\nBased on the generated knowledge, I'll evaluate my options. My current resources have varying values, and I want to increase total value by trading low-value, abundant resources (like Wheat and Wood) for higher-value ones (like Ore). From Player 0's previous offer, they seem eager for Ore, so I can leverage that by offering a modified version of their proposal\u2014giving them some Wheat and Wood but requesting less Ore than they asked for, ensuring a net positive value for me.\n\nSpecifically, I'll offer 3 Wheat (value: 3 * 5 = 15) and 2 Wood (value: 2 * 10 = 20), totaling 35 in value, in exchange for 1 Ore (value: 37). This results in a net gain of 2 value for me (37 received - 35 given). I have sufficient quantities (Wheat: 12 > 3, Wood: 13 > 2), and this offer is conservative enough to align with Player 0's past interest in Ore while prioritizing my goal of value maximization.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge:\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are relevant to my current situation as Player 1. First, **value maximization** is crucial; I must evaluate trades based on my own resource values to ensure the net value of my resources increases. For example, I should only accept or propose trades where the total value of resources I receive exceeds the value of what I give, using my assigned values (e.g., Ore at 37 is highly valuable, so I should aim to acquire it if possible). Second, **assess opponent behavior and scarcity**; from the history, Player 0 has repeatedly offered Wheat and Wood in exchange for Ore, indicating they likely have an excess of those resources and a high demand for Ore. This suggests I can leverage my abundant resources (like Sheep and Brick) to negotiate for Ore, while avoiding trades that deplete my high-value holdings unnecessarily. Third, **negotiation tactics matter in a limited-turn game**; with only 10 turns total, I should make efficient, slightly favorable offers to build momentum, starting with proposals that offer a small concession to entice the opponent but still result in a net gain for me (e.g., offering resources they might value more than I do). Fourth, **risk management**; if an offer is rejected, escalate gradually by adjusting the terms rather than overcommitting early. Finally, **mutual benefit insight**; trades work best when they address the opponent's needs\u2014here, Player 0 wants Ore, so I should propose deals that provide it to them in exchange for my excess or lower-value resources, while ensuring my net value gain is positive.\n\n### Trading Decision:\nBased on the generated knowledge, I am applying these principles to my situation. Player 0 has shown interest in Ore through their previous offers, and I have an abundance of Sheep (25 quantity), which has a moderate value (14 per unit) to me. By offering 2 Sheep (total value: 2 * 14 = 28), I can propose a trade for 1 Ore (value: 37), resulting in a net value gain for me (37 - 28 = +9). This offer addresses Player 0's apparent need for Ore while using my excess resources, and it's a slight escalation from my previous offer to make it more appealing without overcommitting.

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\nBased on my current situation in the Negotiation Game, here are the key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are most relevant:\n\n- **Value-Based Trading**: Always prioritize trades that result in a net gain in total resource value. For instance, I should only offer resources whose combined value is less than the value of what I receive, ensuring my overall portfolio increases. My resources have varying values (e.g., Ore at 37 is the highest), so I must calculate this carefully\u2014e.g., if I offer items worth 23 total value for items worth 37, that's a gain of 14, aligning with my goal.\n\n- **Negotiation Dynamics and Incremental Offers**: In repeated rejections, like Player 0 rejecting my previous offers (e.g., 2 Sheep for 1 Ore), I should adjust by making slightly more attractive offers without overcommitting. This involves starting with conservative trades and incrementally adding value to entice the other player, while avoiding desperation. With only 10 turns total, I need to act proactively but maintain leverage.\n\n- **Resource Scarcity and Opponent Behavior**: High-value resources like Ore (value 37) are likely in demand, as evidenced by Player 0's repeated rejections of my offers for it. I should leverage my abundance in less valuable resources (e.g., I have 25 Sheep and 24 Brick) to trade for premium items. Additionally, observe patterns: Player 0 has offered Wheat and Wood (lower-value items) in the past, suggesting they might value my Brick or Sheep, so I could use this to my advantage by offering items they might need.\n\n- **Risk Management in Limited Turns**: With the game having only 10 turns, I must balance aggression with caution. Rejecting poor deals is fine, but prolonged stalemates could leave me with suboptimal resources. Aim for mutually beneficial trades by estimating what the other player might accept based on past interactions, and always ensure my offers provide me a clear edge.\n\n### Application of Knowledge to Trading Decision\nApplying these principles, my current resources are strong in quantity but vary in value, with Ore being the most valuable at 37 per unit. Player 0 has consistently rejected my offers for Ore, indicating they either highly value it or want a better deal. To increase my total value, I should focus on acquiring more Ore while offering resources I have in surplus, like Brick (value 23), which is still less valuable than Ore. A net gain is essential, so I'll propose trading 1 Brick (worth 23) for 1 Ore (worth 37), resulting in a gain of 14 value for me. This offer is more attractive than my previous one (2 Sheep for 1 Ore, worth 28 for 37) by simplifying the exchange and using a high-but-not-top-tier resource, potentially aligning with Player 0's needs based on their past offers. If rejected, I can adjust further in future turns.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \nIn resource-based negotiation games, several key principles apply to maximize value:\n\n1. **Resource Valuation and Scarcity**: Each resource has an assigned value, and trades should aim to acquire higher-value resources or those that are scarcer in your inventory. In this case, Ore (value 33) is the most valuable resource I possess, followed by Brick (27), Sheep (18), Wood (11), and Wheat (5). Since I have a large quantity of Ore (22), it may be advantageous to trade surplus Ore for high-value resources I lack or for multiple lower-value resources that collectively provide a net gain.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost**: Giving up 1 Ore (value 33) should only be done if I receive resources whose total value exceeds 33. Accepting less in return risks devaluing my strongest asset.\n\n3. **Supply and Demand in Negotiation**: Other players are likely seeking Ore due to its high value. Player 1 has repeatedly offered increasingly valuable packages (from Wheat/Wood \u2192 Sheep \u2192 Brick) just to get 1 Ore. This signals high demand for Ore, which I possess in abundance. I can leverage this scarcity to negotiate better deals.\n\n4. **Incremental Gains vs. Strategic Holds**: While small trades can offer incremental gains, accepting a 1:1 trade of 1 Ore for 1 Brick (value 27) results in a net loss of 6 value points. Such trades should be denied unless part of a larger multi-resource strategy.\n\n5. **Trade Leverage and Counter-Offering**: Since Player 1 has shown interest in acquiring Ore, I should use this demand to my advantage by making a strategic offer that exchanges a small amount of high-value Ore for a bundle of lower-value resources whose total value exceeds the Ore given.\n\n6. **Patience and Timing**: With 10 turns total and only a few exchanged so far, there is time to wait for or provoke better offers. However, initiating a well-calculated offer now can set favorable trade precedents.\n\nGiven that Player 1 has just offered 1 Brick for 1 Ore, which is unfavorable, I should reject and make a counter-offer that flips the value equation in my favor.\n\nApplication:  \nI currently have 22 Ore \u2014 more than any other resource. Trading 1 Ore (value 33) for 1 Brick (value 27) is a losing proposition. However, I can offer a small amount of a lower-value resource to sweeten a deal that exchanges Ore for multiple Sheep or Wood, which are valuable and in moderate supply.\n\nBut wait \u2014 actually, Player 1 is offering *to give me* 1 Brick for *1 Ore*. That's still a net loss. I should not accept.\n\nInstead, I should try to **acquire Ore** \u2014 no, I already have a lot. But since others want it, I can trade excess Ore for multiple lower-value goods.\n\nBest strategy: Offload small quantities of **Ore** (which is abundant) to acquire **Sheep** or **Brick** \u2014 but only if the value balance favors me.\n\nCurrent offer: [1 Brick \u2192 1 Ore] \u2014 I would lose 6 value. Deny.\n\nBetter move: I should make an offer where I *receive* Ore? No \u2014 I already have 22. I should *leverage* my surplus to gain other high/value resources.\n\nSo, propose: give 1 Ore (value 33) but receive, for example, 1 Sheep (18) + 1 Brick (27) = 45 total value \u2192 net gain of 12.\n\nBut that would be giving 1 resource worth 33 to get 2 worth 45 \u2014 good.\n\nBut wait \u2014 no: 18 + 27 = 45? 18 + 27 = 45 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo offering 1 Ore for 1 Sheep and 1 Brick is favorable.\n\nBut I should check: do I want more Brick? I have 14 already. But it's high value. Sheep are also high value.\n\nAlternative: give 1 Ore for 2 Sheep (36 total) \u2014 net gain 3.\n\nOr give 1 Ore for 1 Brick (27) \u2014 net loss \u2014 bad.\n\nWait \u2014 I'm considering the trade from the wrong side.\n\nIf I **give** 1 Ore, I'm losing 33. So I must **gain** more than 33 in total value.\n\nSo to trade 1 Ore, I need:\n\n- 2 Sheep = 36 \u2192 acceptable\n- 1 Brick + 1 Sheep = 45 \u2192 very good\n- 1 Brick + 1 Wood = 38 \u2192 acceptable\n- 3 Wood = 33 \u2192 break even \u2192 not worth it (unless strategic)\n\nPlayer 1 keeps offering to *get* Ore from me. So I can counter with: I will give you 1 Ore only if you give me valuable bundles.\n\nBut so far, their best offer was 1 Brick for 1 Ore \u2014 still below value.\n\nSo I should make my own offer \u2014 one that gives *me* net value gain.\n\nI currently have a lot of Wheat (12), Wood (25), Ore (22). I should reduce low-value, high-quantity resources to improve total value.\n\nWheat is only value 5 \u2014 lowest. So trading Wheat for higher-value items is smart.\n\nFor example: offer 5 Wheat (25 total value) + 1 Wood (11) = 36 \u2014 for 1 Ore (33). That's a net gain of 3 \u2014 barely worth it.\n\nBut better: 3 Wood (33) \u2192 1 Ore (33) \u2014 break even.\n\nOr: 2 Sheep (36) \u2192 1 Ore (33) \u2014 I would be giving away more value \u2014 bad.\n\nWait \u2014 I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me reframe: My goal is to increase **total value** of my resources.\n\nSo I should trade away **low-value-per-unit** resources (Wheat, Wood) to get **high-value** ones (Ore, Brick, Sheep) \u2014 even if it means gaining fewer units.\n\nAlternatively, since I have surplus Ore, and others want it, I can use 1 Ore to get more than 33 value in return.\n\nBut last offer was from Player 1: they give me 1 Brick (27), I give 1 Ore (33). I lose 6 \u2192 bad.\n\nSo I should deny and make a better offer.\n\nBest bet: use **Wheat** and **Wood** \u2014 low value \u2014 to acquire **Sheep** or **Brick**.\n\nFor example: 3 Wheat (15) + 5 Wood (55) = 70 \u2192 can get 2 Sheep (36) \u2192 too much loss.\n\nNo \u2014 I need to receive more value than I give.\n\nSo ideal: give 6 Wheat (30) \u2192 get 1 Sheep (18)? No \u2014 I lose value.\n\nWait: giving low-value units to get high-value is only good if the total value I give is less than total value I receive.\n\nSo if I give 6 Wheat = 6*5 = 30 \u2192 get 1 Sheep = 18 \u2192 I lose value \u2192 bad.\n\nBut 1 Wheat is worth 5, 1 Sheep is worth 18. So to get 1 Sheep, I can afford to give up to 3 Wheat and 1 Wood (15+11=26 < 18? No \u2014 26 > 18 \u2014 still overpay).\n\nBetter: I should aim to trade **my high-value surplus** (like Ore) for **bundles** of resources whose total value exceeds 33.\n\nBut others are *willing to pay* for Ore \u2014 so I can set the terms.\n\nPlayer 1 offered: 1 Brick \u2192 1 Ore. Bad for me.\n\nSo I should **counter** with: I will give you 1 Ore only if you give me 1 Brick and 1 Sheep.\n\nBut that\u2019s not an offer format. I need to make my own offer.\n\nSo [Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]\n\nValue given: 33 (Ore)\nValue received: 27 + 18 = 45 \u2192 net gain: +12 \u2192 excellent.\n\nDo I have 1 Ore? Yes, 22.\nWould I gain total value? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, offer even better value: give 2 Ore \u2192 get 2 Brick and 1 Sheep = 54 + 18 = 72 \u2192 cost 66 \u2192 gain 6, but spread out.\n\nBut smaller trades are safer and more likely accepted.\n\nI also have a lot of Wood \u2014 maybe trade Wood for Sheep?\n\nFor example: 6 Wood = 66 \u2192 get 3 Sheep = 54 \u2192 I lose \u2192 bad.\n\nNo.\n\nBut if I give 3 Wood (33) \u2192 get 2 Sheep (36) \u2192 gain 3 \u2192 good.\n\nBut Player 1 hasn\u2019t shown interest in Wood beyond early offers.\n\nRecent offers show they want **Ore**.\n\nSo best to use Ore as trade bait.\n\nAlso, large quantities of Wood and Wheat can be offloaded later \u2014 but for now, leverage Ore demand.\n\nDecision:\n\nPlayer 1 just offered: [1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis is unfavorable. I should deny it.\n\nThen, make my own offer that exploits their desire for Ore but flips the value.\n\nSo: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]\n\nThis gives them desirable Ore in exchange for two resources whose combined value exceeds Ore\u2019s.\n\nThis trade increases my total value by 12.\n\nDeny their offer and make this counter.\n\nBut I can only make one action per turn.\n\nThe last move was: Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 1 Brick -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n\nSo I must respond.\n\nI can either [Accept], [Deny], or make a new [Offer].\n\n[Deny] is default, but I can overwrite with [Offer].\n\nBest action: respond with a new [Offer] that is more favorable.\n\nBecause if I deny without offering, I may lose the trade window.\n\nSo I make a new offer that improves the value flow.\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]\n\nBut let's check inventory:\n\nI have 22 Ore \u2192 giving 1: ok\nI have 14 Brick \u2192 so can I receive Brick? Yes.\nI have 16 Sheep \u2192 receiving 1: ok\n\nPlayer may have them \u2014 uncertainty, but that's negotiation.\n\nRisk: they reject. But better than losing value.\n\nIs there a safer offer?\n\nAlternative: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep] \u2192 value given 33, received 36 \u2192 gain 3 \u2192 acceptable but less gain.\n\nOr [Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick] \u2192 give 33+11=44, get 54 \u2192 gain 10 \u2192 good, but I give more.\n\nBetter to keep it simple.\n\nBest: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]\n\nValue: net +12\n\nAlternatively, use my low-value resources.\n\nExample: [Offer: 6 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep] \u2192 give 30+22=52, get 18 \u2192 huge loss \u2014 no.\n\nNo, I must receive more value.\n\nOr: [Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Sheep] \u2192 give 33, get 18 \u2014 no.\n\nIt\u2019s not feasible to trade low-value resources for high-value ones unless in bulk or with concessions.\n\nSo best path: use surplus of high-demand resource (Ore) to gain combinations.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Deny] the offer of 1 Brick for 1 Ore \u2014 because it\u2019s a net loss.\n\nThen, make a new [Offer].\n\nBut can I do both?\n\nThe format allows me to choose one action.\n\nLooking at pattern: I can respond with [Accept], [Deny], or [Offer].\n\n[Offer] implies rejecting the current one and proposing a new deal.\n\nSo I should output:\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]\n\nThis serves as both rejection and counter-proposal.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I make that offer.",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nBefore making my trading decision, I'll outline key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are relevant to my current situation as Player 1. This is based on general negotiation tactics, resource valuation, and the game's context.\n\n1. **Value Maximization Principle**: The primary goal is to ensure that any trade increases the total value of my resources. I must calculate the net value gain by comparing the value of resources I'm offering against what I'm receiving. For instance, if I give resources worth 37 points and receive resources worth 50 points, I've gained 13 points. This is crucial because the game rewards overall value growth, so I should avoid neutral or losing trades.\n\n2. **Scarcity and Abundance Strategy**: I have abundant resources like Sheep (25 qty) and Brick (24 qty), which have lower individual values (14 and 23, respectively) compared to Ore (37). I should leverage my surpluses (e.g., trade excess Sheep or Brick) for high-value resources like Ore, which I already have in moderate quantity (17 qty). However, I must be cautious not to deplete my stocks too quickly, especially of high-value items. Conversely, if the other player values my abundant resources highly, I can use them as bargaining chips.\n\n3. **Negotiation Patterns and History Insight**: From the game history, Player 0 has rejected several of my offers (e.g., 3 Wheat and 2 Wood for 1 Ore, or 2 Sheep for 1 Ore) but accepted my offer of 1 Brick for 1 Ore. This suggests Player 0 prioritizes certain resources and may be testing for better deals. I should build on successful past trades by proposing similar offers that worked before, while escalating or countering unreasonable demands. In negotiations, it's often effective to start with firm but fair counters to maintain momentum, especially since the game only has 10 turns left (based on the history, we're likely past several turns).\n\n4. **Risk Management in Limited Turns**: With only 10 turns total, I need to prioritize trades that provide immediate value gains to avoid stagnation. Rejecting poor offers is better than accepting them if they don't advance my position, but I should always follow up with a counteroffer to keep the negotiation active. Overly aggressive demands might lead to more rejections, so aim for balanced trades that slightly favor me based on value.\n\n5. **Fairness and Psychological Insight**: Trades should appear fair to encourage acceptance, but I can tilt them in my favor by offering resources the other player wants (e.g., Brick, based on history). People (or AIs) are more likely to accept trades that provide them value too, so I should avoid exploitative offers. If an incoming offer is neutral in value, it's not beneficial, so denying it and countering is a smart move.\n\nIn summary, these principles emphasize calculating net value, using my resource strengths, learning from history, managing turn limits, and fostering ongoing negotiation to maximize my gains.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\n\nApplying the above knowledge to the current situation: Player 0 has offered me 1 Ore (value: 37) in exchange for 1 Brick (value: 23) and 1 Sheep (value: 14). The total value I'm giving is 23 + 14 = 37, which exactly matches the value I'm receiving (37). This results in a net value change of 0, meaning it doesn't increase my total resource value as required by my goal. Based on the Value Maximization Principle, I should reject this offer since it doesn't provide any gain.\n\nFrom the Scarcity and Abundance Strategy, I have plenty of Brick and Sheep, so giving them away without compensation isn't ideal, especially when I can use them in a better trade. Negotiation Patterns show that Player 0 previously accepted my offer of 1 Brick for 1 Ore, which gave me a net gain of +14 value. This history suggests I can counter with a similar, successful offer to potentially secure a gain while keeping the game moving, aligning with Risk Management in Limited Turns.\n\nTherefore, I'll deny the incoming offer and make a counteroffer: Offer 1 Brick (which I have in abundance) for 1 Ore, as this previously worked and would increase my value by +14 (37 received minus 23 given). This approach maintains fairness while prioritizing my objectives.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "**Generate Knowledge:**\n\nIn resource-based negotiation games, several key principles apply to maximize the value of one\u2019s resource portfolio:\n\n1. **Resource Scarcity and Value Gradient**: Higher-value resources (like Ore at 33) are typically more scarce and valuable for development, but having excess of a high-value resource might make it advantageous to trade down strategically for resources that are harder for you to obtain yet critical for future gains.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost**: Every trade involves evaluating not just immediate value, but what you could do with the resources\u2014keeping vs. trading. Giving up 1 Ore (value 33) should ideally get you resources whose combined value exceeds that, or fills a critical gap in your strategy.\n\n3. **Diminishing Marginal Utility**: Holding too much of one resource provides less marginal benefit. I have 22 Ore\u2014the highest value per unit. If I have no immediate use for that much Ore, trading some away for understocked but high-value resources (like Sheep at 18 or Brick at 27) may balance and increase my total *usable* value.\n\n4. **Relative Abundance and Demand**: I have only 12 Wheat and 25 Wood\u2014modest quantities of low-to-mid value resources. Sheep (16) and Brick (14) are decent, but Ore (22) is abundant. Other players may want Ore, so it can be used as leverage.\n\n5. **Reciprocity and Trust Building**: Accepting a fair offer can encourage future cooperation. Player 1 recently offered 1 Brick for 1 Ore\u2014this is a fair value trade (33 vs 27), slightly favoring me. I accepted it, which built some trust.\n\n6. **Strategic Imbalance**: My current holdings:\n   - Wheat: 12 (5) \u2192 low value\n   - Wood: 25 (11) \u2192 medium value, decent stock\n   - Sheep: 16 (18) \u2192 valuable, decent stock\n   - Brick: 14 (27) \u2192 high value, could be higher\n   - Ore: 22 (33) \u2192 highest value, abundant\n\nI have a surplus of Ore, which I can afford to trade. Brick and Sheep are high-value and I can benefit from increasing those, even at a slight cost.\n\n7. **Trade Leverage**: Since Player 1 has offered 1 Brick for 1 Ore twice, they likely value Ore\u2014possibly they are short on it. I can use that demand to get additional value. But I must offer something only they want.\n\n8. **Trade Efficiency**: Aim for trades where the value ratio favors me, or where I acquire resources I need more than the ones I give up.\n\n9. **Repeated Interaction**: With 10 turns total and several already passed, we\u2019re in mid-game. Cooperation can escalate, so consistent denial without counter-offers might shut down trade. Proactive offers can steer the interaction.\n\n10. **Risk of Over-Trading Ore**: Ore is my most valuable resource. I must avoid depleting it for lower-value returns. But 22 units is a lot\u2014trading 1-2 units for combo gains is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\nPlayer 1 just re-offered: **1 Brick \u2192 1 Ore**\n\nI already accepted this once. Repeating it would give me:\n- Lose 1 Ore (33) \u2192 Gain 1 Brick (27): net value loss of 6.\n\nThat trade now disadvantages me. Since I already accepted it once, and I\u2019m in a position of relative strength (I control more Ore), I should either:\n- **Deny** the same offer again, or\n- Make a **counter-offer** that improves my value.\n\nBut I recently offered: *1 Ore \u2192 1 Brick, 1 Sheep* (value: 33 out, 27 + 18 = 45 in) \u2014 a great deal for me.
