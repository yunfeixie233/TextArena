Resource-value mapping (value per unit in MY eyes)  \n   Wheat 6, Wood 11, Sheep 13, Brick 24, Ore 37.\n\n3. Marginal diminishing returns  \n   I already have \u226520 units of Wheat, Brick and Ore. The twenty-second Wheat or twenty-first Brick is worth far less to me than additional Wood or Sheep, where I stand at only 7 Wood and 6 Sheep.\n\n4. Liquidity and trading partners  \n   Other players presumably value Brick and Ore far less, but place higher value on Wheat/Wood/Sheep. Make sure any outgoing Brick/Ore trades give THEM something they really want (low for me) to extract maximum surplus.\n\n5. Trade-size rule  \n   The offer syntax \u201cX of A, Y of B \u2192 P of C, Q of D\u201d can swap at most 7 resource slots. Assume face-to-face Catan-negotiation style, so 5 is the practical upper limit on any single commodity.\n\n6. Bilateral versus multilateral  \n   One-on-one trades are safest; multi-player games risk someone else snapping up my intended target if I wait.\n\nApplying the knowledge:\n\nGoal: Increase total value while fixing imbalance.  \nBiggest opportunity: 20 Ore valued 37 each. One Ore gone, one more Wood gained increases utility.  \n\nConsider:  \nGive up 2 Ore \u2192 74 value lost.  \nReceive 5 Brick + 2 Sheep \u2192 5\u00b724 + 2\u00b713 = 146 value gained.  \nNet change 146 \u2013 74 = +72 in my favor.\n\nChecks against constraints:  \n- Exchange \u22647 items. 2 out, 7 in is tight but legal in Catan trade windows.  \n- Opportunity cost is very low because I sit on 20 Ore and only 7 Wood, but increasing Brick/Sheep mix shifts portfolio toward higher-marginal-utility holdings.\n\nTough to improve further without complicating:\n\n- 3 Sheep and 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick and 2 Sheep is in fact 2 Ore for 5 Brick + 1 extra Sheep  \n  Value surrendered = 2\u00b737 \u2013 (5\u00b724 + 1\u00b713) = 74 \u2013 133 = \u201359, gain 59. A good deal but smaller margin than the 5 Bricks alone.\n\nThe 5 Brick single-commodity-for-Ore trade offers the largest clear surplus, but pure Ore \u2190\u2192 Brick may not excite another player.\n\nThus, add 2 Sheep (high-value for me but still kicker) to slightly tilt preference in their direction while still keeping surplus at 72.\n\nHence:\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]\n\nDelivered.",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The core objective is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade should ideally bring in more value than it gives away. Calculate the value of both sides of an offer.\n2.  **Resource Scarcity/Demand:** Identify which of my resources are highly valued by others (high value per unit) and which I have in abundance. Similarly, understand which resources I need and which are harder to acquire.\n3.  **Marginal Value vs. Absolute Value:** While initial value is important, consider the marginal utility of additional units. Do I have too much of one low-value resource that I can trade for a high-value one, even if the absolute value difference isn't huge?\n4.  **Strategic Hoarding/Selling:** High-value items (like Ore and Brick for me) should be traded carefully. Low-value items (Wheat, Wood) can be traded more freely to acquire better resources.\n5.  **Offer Analysis:**\n    *   **Player 0's Offer:** Player 0 is offering 2 Ore (Value: 2 * 33 = 66) for 5 Brick (Value: 5 * 28 = 140) and 2 Sheep (Value: 2 * 12 = 24).\n    *   **My Gain/Loss:** My current offer means I lose resources worth 140 + 24 = 164, and gain resources worth 66. This is a net loss of 98 value.\n6.  **Negotiation Posture:** Since the incoming offer is highly unfavorable, I must deny it and make a counter-offer that aligns with my value maximization goal. I have a good quantity of Brick and Sheep, but they are also moderately-to-highly valued. Ore is extremely valuable, and giving it away for far less than its worth is not an option.\n7.  **Identify Trade Targets:** I have an abundance of Wheat (low value) and Wood (medium value). I have a decent amount of Sheep and Brick. Ore is my highest value per unit, and I only have 6 units, so I should be very protective of it. I want more Ore and Brick. I can afford to give up Wheat and Wood more readily.\n8.  **Formulate a Counter-Offer:** I need to make an offer that is attractive to Player 0 while still increasing my value. I should offer resources I have in abundance and/or lower value for resources I want (high value, like Ore or Brick). Player 0's offer indicates they might be looking for Brick and Sheep. I have 18 Brick (high value) and 16 Sheep (medium value). I also have 18 Wheat (low value) and 11 Wood (medium-low value).\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\nValue of Player 0's offer to me: Lose (5 * 28) + (2 * 12) = 140 + 24 = 164. Gain (2 * 33) = 66. Net loss = 98. This is a terrible offer for me. I must deny.\n\nMy resources and values:\n*   Wheat: 18 @ 6 = 108\n*   Wood: 11 @ 9 = 99\n*   Sheep: 16 @ 12 = 192\n*   Brick: 18 @ 28 = 504\n*   Ore: 6 @ 33 = 198\nTotal Value: 108 + 99 + 192 + 504 + 198 = 1101\n\nI want to acquire Ore and/or Brick, which are my highest value resources. Player 0 seems interested in Brick and Sheep. I can leverage my abundance of Wheat and Wood.\n\nConsider a counter-offer:\nWhat if I offer low-value resources for Ore or Brick?\nExample 1: Offer Wheat.\nIf I give 10 Wheat (value 60) for 1 Ore (value 33). This is a bad trade for me.\nWhat if I give 5 Wood (value 45) and 5 Wheat (value 30) = 75 for 2 Ore (value 66). Still bad.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore/Brick. Player 0 *wants* Brick and Sheep. I have a lot of Brick. I also have a lot of Sheep.\nI need to be careful with my Brick and Ore as they are my highest value resources. My value per unit of Brick is 28, and Sheep is 12.\n\nLet's make an offer where I give away low-value items for higher-value items.\nPerhaps I can target Player 0's need for Brick/Sheep, but offer resources with lower value to me (Wheat/Wood) to get high value resources (Ore/Brick).\n\nConsider an offer where I request Ore and offer Wheat or Wood.\n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore] (Value offered: 48, Value requested: 33). Still a loss. No.\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Ore] (Value offered: 45, Value requested: 33). Still a loss. No.\n\nI must offer something Player 0 wants, and Player 0 showed interest in my Brick and Sheep.\nLet's try to get 1 Ore for a minimum necessary amount of Brick/Sheep.\nCurrently, Player 0 offers 2 Ore (Value 66) for 5 Brick (Value 140) and 2 Sheep (Value 24). This is still a terrible offer for me.\n\nI need to turn this around. I want *their* Ore. How about I offer them something they want *and* I want to get rid of (Wheat/Wood) and sweeten the deal with a small amount of Sheep if necessary.\n\nLet's try to get 1 Ore.\nWhat if I offer a balanced trade for me?\nOffer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood (Value: 5 * 6 + 2 * 9 = 30 + 18 = 48)\nRequest: 1 Ore, 1 Wood (Value: 33 + 9 = 42). Net gain for me. Potentially not attractive enough for Player 0.\n\nPlayer 0 showed interest in Brick, but it's my second most valuable resource. I have 18.\nPerhaps I can get more Ore by giving up some Brick, but at a favorable ratio.\nIf Player 0 wants 5 Brick for 2 Ore, that's 2.5 Brick per Ore for them.\nI want more Ore.\n\nLet's try to acquire 1 Ore.\nI could offer more low-value resources for it.\nHow about I offer a decent amount of less valuable resources for just *one* Ore.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nMy side: 10 * 6 (Wheat) + 2 * 9 (Wood) = 60 + 18 = 78\nTheir side: 1 * 33 (Ore) = 33\nThis is a high cost for me to acquire Ore. But if I desperately need Ore, it might be worth it.\n\nSince Player 0 is asking for a lot of Brick and Sheep, let's try to give them some, but for more valuable items.\n\nFinal Trade Decision:\n\n**Reject Player 0's offer.** It's a significant value loss for me.\n\n**Counter-offer:** I will make an offer to acquire more Ore, which is my highest value resource, while divesting myself of lower-value resources. Player 0 expressed desire for Brick and Sheep, so a small amount of those might be needed to make the deal attractive, but only if the overall value exchange is positive for me.\n\nI have 18 Wheat and 11 Wood. These are my lowest value per unit resources.\n\nLet's offer a trade where I aim to gain value.\nOffered: 15 Wheat (value 90) + 3 Wood (value 27) = 117\nRequested: 3 Ore (value 99) + 1 Brick (value 28) = 127\nNet gain of 10 value for me. This is a lot of Wheat and Wood. Player 0 might not want that much.\n\nLet's consider what Player 0 requested: Brick and Sheep.\nIf I *must* give Brick, I need to get enough Ore to justify it.\nPlayer 0 offered 2 Ore for 5 Brick and 2 Sheep. So, I would give 5 Brick (140) and 2 Sheep (24) to get 2 Ore (66).\nThis is a net loss of 98 for me. Unacceptable.\n\nI need a positive value trade.\nI have a significant amount of Brick. I might consider giving up some if I get more Ore.\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (value 28) for 1 Ore (value 33)? That's a +5 gain for me. It's a plausible trade.\nHowever, Player 0 is asking for *5* Brick for 2 Ore.\n\nI will try to acquire 1 Ore and 1 Brick from Player 0.\nHow about:\nOffer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep (Value: 5*6 + 2*12 = 30 + 24 = 54)\nRequest: 1 Ore, 1 Brick (Value: 33 + 28 = 61)\nThis is a +7 value gain for me. It offers Sheep which Player 0 wants, and a decent amount of Wheat.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",

This means any trade I propose or accept must result in a net gain in value. I need to calculate the value of items offered and items requested for every potential trade.\n2.  **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:** I have a significant amount of Brick (18 units) and Wheat (18 units). Ore (6 units) and Wood (11 units) are less abundant. Sheep (16 units) are in the middle.

This reinforces their potential desire for Sheep and Ore.\n5.  **Strategic Bidding/Offering:** I need to propose trades that are attractive enough for Player 0 but still highly beneficial for me. Offering resources I have in abundance for those I need (or more valuable ones) is a good strategy.\n6.  **Negotiation Posture:** Player 0 has rejected my previous offer (8 Wheat for 1 Ore).

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade should ideally result in a net gain in value.\n2.  **Scarcity and Demand:** Resources with higher individual values (like Ore and Brick for me) are generally more valuable to acquire and less valuable to give away. If a resource is also scarce for the opponent, its perceived value might increase, allowing for favorable trades.\n3.  **Understanding Opponent's Needs:** While I don't explicitly know Player 0's inventory, their offers give clues. Previously, Player 0 offered 2 Ore for 5 Brick, 2 Sheep, then accepted when I gave up 5 Brick, 2 Wood for 3 Sheep, 2 Ore. This suggests they might value Sheep and Ore, or perhaps they were diversifying. Now they are offering Wheat and Brick for Wood and Sheep. This reinforces a potential need for Wood and Sheep from their side.\n4.  **Resource Utility/Efficiency:** Consider the \"value per unit\" (VPU) of resources to determine if a trade is good.\n    *   Wheat: 6\n    *   Wood: 9\n    *   Sheep: 12\n    *   Brick: 28\n    *   Ore: 33\n5.  **Strategic Resource Holding:** It can be beneficial to hold onto high-value resources (Ore, Brick) unless the trade offers a significant net gain. Conversely, I can be more flexible with lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood).\n6.  **Patience and Iteration:** Not every offer needs to be accepted. If an offer isn't optimal, I can deny it and counter with a better one, or wait for a more favorable trade. The game has 10 turns, allowing for multiple negotiation rounds.\n7.  **Current Inventory Analysis:**\n    *   Wheat: 18 (Value: 6) - Abundant, low value. Good for trading away if necessary.\n    *   Wood: 11 (Value: 9) - Moderate quantity, low-mid value.\n    *   Sheep: 16 (Value: 12) - Abundant, mid value. Player 0 seems to want this.\n    *   Brick: 18 (Value: 28) - Abundant, high-value. Traded some in the last turn, still have plenty.\n    *   Ore: 6 (Value: 33) - Scarce, highest value. I want more of this.\n\nPlayer 0's current offer: Offered items: 4 Wheat, 2 Brick -> Requested items: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep\n\n*   **Value of Offered Items (Player 0):** (4 * 6) + (2 * 28) = 24 + 56 = 80\n*   **Value of Requested Items (Player 1 to give):** (3 * 9) + (2 * 12) = 27 + 24 = 51\n\nThis means Player 0 is offering me resources worth 80 for resources from me worth 51. This is a net gain of 80 - 51 = 29 value for me.\n\n*   **Impact on my inventory:**\n    *   Wheat: 18 + 4 = 22\n    *   Wood: 11 - 3 = 8\n    *   Sheep: 16 - 2 = 14\n    *   Brick: 18 + 2 = 20\n    *   Ore: 6 (unchanged)\n\nThis trade is very favorable in terms of raw value. I give away Wood and Sheep, which are not my highest value resources. I gain Wheat (low value) and Brick (high value). The net value gain is significant.\n\nDecision: The offer is numerically advantageous. I give up resources which are relatively less valuable or abundant for highly valuable resources (Brick) and some low-value resources (Wheat) which I also have in large quantities. This directly contributes to my goal of increasing total value.\n\n[Accept]",

One-sided offers: Since Player 1 has stopped making counter-offers, I can control the negotiation flow; I should keep proposing until marginal values shift or Player 1 shows resistance.\n\nApply Knowledge  \nCurrent inventory (after last accepted trade):  \n Wheat 10, Wood 3, Sheep 0, Brick 8, Ore 20  \n\nDesired moves:  \n- Acquire at least 4 Wood and 4 Sheep to keep building value.  \n- Give away 4 Wheat and 3 Brick, whose combined value to me is 4\u00b76 + 3\u00b724 = 96.  \n- Receive 4 Wood (4\u00b711 = 44) and 4 Sheep (4\u00b713 = 52) for a total of 96; net value change 0, but shifts resources into scarcer/higher-marginal-value ones.  \nA slightly better ratio for me: 4 Wheat, 3 Brick \u2192 5 Wood, 4 Sheep.  \nMy net value change = (5\u00b711 + 4\u00b713) \u2013 (4\u00b76 + 3\u00b724) = 107 \u2013 96 = +11.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Brick -> 5 Wood, 4 Sheep]",
