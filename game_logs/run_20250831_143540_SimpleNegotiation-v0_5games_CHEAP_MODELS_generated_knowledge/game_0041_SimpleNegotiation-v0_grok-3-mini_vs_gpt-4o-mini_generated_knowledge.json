      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nBefore making a trading decision, I'll outline key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are relevant to my current situation as Player 0. This is based on standard negotiation game dynamics, where the goal is to maximize the total value of my resources.\n\n- **Value-Based Trading Principle:** Always prioritize trades that result in a net increase in total resource value. Calculate the value of resources you're giving versus receiving to ensure a positive gain. In my case, with resources like Ore (value 37 per unit) and Brick (value 29 per unit) being high-value, I should be cautious about trading them away unless I receive more value in return. Conversely, low-value resources like Wheat (value 6 per unit) can be used as \"currency\" to acquire higher-value items, as long as the overall trade is beneficial.\n\n- **Scarcity and Opportunity Cost Strategy:** Consider the scarcity of your resources and the game's limited turns (10 total). I have abundant low-value resources (e.g., 24 Wheat), so I can afford to trade them for scarcer, higher-value ones (e.g., Ore, which I only have 6 of). However, avoid depleting high-value resources early unless it's for a clear gain, as this could limit future options. With 10 turns, I should aim for proactive trades now to build value momentum.\n\n- **Negotiation Tactics Insight:** Start with offers that favor you slightly to leave room for counteroffers, but ensure they're reasonable to encourage acceptance. In multi-player games, trades should appear mutually beneficial, but always protect your interests. For example, if another player values my excess Wheat highly, I can leverage that to get better deals. Reject or counter unfair incoming offers, and use combinations of resources to make trades more appealing.\n\n- **Risk Management and Long-Term View:** Don't rush into trades that don't provide immediate value gains, as the game is finite. Diversify your portfolio slightly if it increases value, but focus on high-impact resources. In my situation, trading excess low-value items (like Wheat or Wood) for high-value ones (like Brick or Ore) could compound my advantages over multiple turns.\n\nThese insights apply directly to my resources: I have a strong position in Brick (high value and quantity) but could benefit from more Ore, so I'll aim for trades that exploit my surpluses while increasing total value.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge, I'll evaluate my current resources and aim for a trade that increases my total value. My current total value is calculated as follows:\n- Wheat: 24 qty \u00d7 6 value = 144\n- Wood: 10 qty \u00d7 11 value = 110\n- Sheep: 12 qty \u00d7 15 value = 180\n- Brick: 13 qty \u00d7 29 value = 377\n- Ore: 6 qty \u00d7 37 value = 222\n- **Total Value: 144 + 110 + 180 + 377 + 222 = 1033**\n\nI want to trade away some of my abundant, lower-value resources (e.g., Brick, which I have 13 of) to acquire more high-value resources (e.g., Ore). After testing combinations, I'll propose an offer that gives me a net gain: Offering 5 Brick (value: 5 \u00d7 29 = 145) in exchange for 2 Ore (value: 2 \u00d7 37 = 74) and 5 Sheep (value: 5 \u00d7 15 = 75), for a total received value of 149. This results in a net gain of 149 - 145 = 4 value points, while also increasing my quantity of high-value resources.\n\nThis decision aligns with the principles above by ensuring a value increase, leveraging my Brick surplus, and maintaining a proactive stance in the game.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore, 5 Sheep]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge:\n\n1. **Value Assessment**: Understanding the value of each resource is crucial. In this case, Ore has a high value (36), and Sheep also holds significant value (15). This makes them desirable resources for trade.\n\n2. **Supply vs. Demand**: If a resource is scarce on the board, its value rises due to demand. If I have a surplus of a resource, I can leverage this to negotiate better trades.\n\n3. **Types of Trade**: Trading quantity vs. quality can have different effects. Offering multiple low-value resources in exchange for fewer high-value resources can often be beneficial, especially if it aligns with the needs of the other player.\n\n4. **Future Trading Potential**: I should always consider my future needs and the potential trades I can make in subsequent turns.

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\nBefore making a trading decision, I've generated relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation based on my current situation. Here are the key principles, strategies, and insights:\n\n1. **Maximize Net Value Gain**: The primary goal is to ensure that any trade increases the total value of my resources. I should calculate the value of resources I'm offering versus what I'm requesting, aiming for a positive net gain (i.e., the value of incoming resources should exceed the value of outgoing resources). For example, with my resources, Ore (value 37) and Brick (value 29) have high values, so prioritizing trades that bring in high-value items like Ore while offering lower-value or abundant resources (like Wheat or Sheep) is key.\n\n2. **Assess Resource Abundance and Scarcity**: I have high quantities of Wheat (24), Wood (10), Sheep (12), and Brick (13), but low quantities of Ore (6). This makes Ore a scarce, high-value resource for me, so I should focus on acquiring more of it. Conversely, I can afford to trade away abundant resources without depleting my stock. Strategies include offering resources I have in excess (e.g., Sheep) to acquire scarce ones, while avoiding trades that deplete critical resources.\n\n3. **Negotiation and Offer Adjustment**: If an offer is rejected, as mine was (offering 5 Brick for 2 Ore and 5 Sheep), I should analyze why and adjust accordingly. Possible reasons for rejection include the offer being perceived as unfair, the other player lacking the requested resources, or misalignment in perceived values. Effective strategies include starting with smaller, more conservative offers to test the waters, making incremental adjustments (e.g., reducing what I offer or increasing what I request), and ensuring the offer provides some value to the other player to encourage acceptance. In a limited-turn game (10 turns total), I need to be efficient and avoid repeated rejections by proposing balanced trades early.\n\n4. **Fairness and Reciprocity**: Trades should appear reasonably fair to the other player to increase acceptance rates. This means not demanding too much value in return, as it could lead to denial. Insights from negotiation theory suggest offering a slight advantage to myself while providing a minor benefit to the other player, fostering goodwill for future turns.\n\n5. **Risk Management in Limited Turns**: With only 10 turns, I must prioritize trades that offer immediate value gains and avoid stalemates. If no counteroffer is made (as with Player 1), I should initiate with a new offer rather than default to denial. Additionally, track patterns: Player 1 rejected my previous offer, so I should simplify or sweeten it slightly without sacrificing my gains.\n\nThis knowledge emphasizes calculated, value-driven decisions to optimize my position in the game.\n\n### Trading Decision\nApplying the generated knowledge, I evaluate my current resources and the rejection of my previous offer (5 Brick for 2 Ore and 5 Sheep, which offered 145 value for 149 value, a slight net gain for me but apparently unappealing). The rejection suggests I need to simplify the offer, focus on acquiring high-value Ore (which I have in scarcity), and use abundant resources like Sheep (value 15, qty 12) to make a more targeted trade.\n\nI'll propose a new offer that:\n- Maximizes my net value gain: Offer 1 Sheep (value 15) for 1 Ore (value 37), resulting in a net gain of +22 value.\n- Leverages my abundance: I have plenty of Sheep, so trading one won't hurt.\n- Adjusts for negotiation: This is a smaller, simpler offer than before, making it easier to accept and reducing the risk of another rejection.\n\nThus, my decision is: [Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

This includes calculating total values and figuring out net gains or losses from trade offers.\n\n2. **Resource Demand and Supply**: Recognize which resources are in higher demand by observing previous trade offers. In this case, both players are likely seeking valuable resources that they currently lack.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics**: Employ negotiation tactics such as anchoring (initially starting with a high offer), making counteroffers that improve your position, or bluffing by acting uninterested in certain resources to drive up their perceived value.\n\n4. **Resources Synergy**: Consider how different resources can be combined effectively.

Then, I'll apply that knowledge to make my trading decision, using the required format and special tokens.\n\n### Generate Knowledge:\nKey principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation relevant to my situation include:\n\n- **Value Maximization**: The primary goal is to ensure that any trade results in a net increase in the total value of my resources. I should calculate the value of what I'm offering versus what I'm receiving, prioritizing trades where the incoming resources' value exceeds the outgoing ones. For instance, my resources have varying values (e.g., Ore at 37 per unit is my most valuable, while Wheat at 6 per unit is the least), so I should seek to acquire high-value resources like Ore while offloading lower-value or abundant ones like Wheat or Wood.\n\n- **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: I have abundant quantities of Wheat (24 units), Wood (10 units), Sheep (12 units), and Brick (13 units), but limited Ore (only 6 units). This suggests I should leverage my surpluses to acquire scarce, high-value resources from other players. Conversely, if Player 1 has rejected my previous offers, they might be facing their own shortages or valuing resources differently, so I need to adjust offers to align with potential demands (e.g., they may need Brick or Sheep more than Ore).\n\n- **Negotiation Tactics and Incremental Adjustments**: In a limited-turn game (only 10 turns total), persistence with adjusted offers is key, but I must avoid unfavorable deals. Start with offers that are slightly in my favor but appear fair to encourage acceptance. If previous offers were rejected (e.g., my offer of 5 Brick for 2 Ore and 5 Sheep, or 1 Sheep for 1 Ore), I should modify them based on feedback\u2014perhaps by including a mix of resources or reducing the quantity I'm asking for\u2014to test boundaries without overcommitting. Common tactics include reciprocity (offering something they might value) and avoiding desperation, as revealing too much need could weaken my position.\n\n- **Risk and Turn Management**: With only a few turns left, I should prioritize trades that offer immediate value gains while minimizing risk. Reject or deny offers that don't benefit me, and only propose new ones if they have a clear upside. For example, trading away high-quantity, medium-value resources (like Sheep or Brick) for high-value, low-quantity ones (like Ore) could be strategic, but I must ensure the net value is positive to justify the turn.\n\n- **Fairness and Perception**: Trades should feel balanced to the other player to increase acceptance rates. Using approximate value comparisons can help\u2014e.g., if I'm offering resources worth X and requesting ones worth Y, aim for Y > X for me while keeping the difference subtle to avoid alienating the other player.\n\nThese insights are directly applicable given my current resources and the history of rejections, where Player 1 has shown reluctance to trade Ore for my offerings.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Make Trading Decision:\nApplying the above knowledge, my current total resource value is 1033 (calculated as: Wheat 24*6=144, Wood 10*11=110, Sheep 12*15=180, Brick 13*29=377, Ore 6*37=222). I want to increase this, particularly by acquiring more Ore due to its high value (37 per unit) and my limited supply. My previous offers were rejected, so I'll adjust by proposing a more balanced trade that leverages my abundant Sheep and Brick while requesting less Ore than before. Specifically:\n\n- I'll offer 1 Brick (value: 29) and 1 Sheep (value: 15), totaling 44 in value, in exchange for 1 Ore (value: 37). This results in a net gain of +7 value for me, which aligns with value maximization.\n- This offer addresses supply and demand by using resources I have in surplus (Sheep and Brick) and requesting a high-value item I need.\n- It's an incremental adjustment from my last offer (1 Sheep for 1 Ore), making it slightly more appealing to Player 1 by adding Brick, which they might value.\n- Given the turn limit, this is a low-risk proposal that could yield a quick gain if accepted.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll make the following offer.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

Then, I'll apply that knowledge to make my trading decision.\n\n### Generate Knowledge:\nBased on my role as Player 0 in this Negotiation Game, where my goal is to increase the total value of my resources, here are the key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are most relevant to my situation:\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: The core principle is to only engage in trades where the total value of resources I receive exceeds the total value of resources I give. My resources have assigned values (e.g., Ore at 37 is the highest), so I must calculate net value gain for every potential trade. For instance, if I offer low-value resources (like Wheat at 6) for high-value ones (like Ore at 37), I should ensure the trade results in a positive net value to avoid depleting my overall portfolio.\n\n2. **Resource Scarcity and Prioritization**: I have limited quantities of high-value resources (e.g., only 6 Ore), so I should prioritize acquiring more of these to boost my total value. Conversely, I have surpluses of lower-value resources (e.g., 24 Wheat), which I can use as bargaining chips without significant loss. In negotiations, I need to consider what the other player might value\u2014based on recent history, Player 1 has shown interest in Brick (value 29) and Sheep (value 15), as they accepted an offer involving those. This insight allows me to leverage my abundance in these areas while targeting scarce, high-value items like Ore for myself.\n\n3. **Negotiation Strategies**: Start with offers that provide a slight advantage to the other player to build goodwill and increase acceptance rates, but always ensure I come out ahead. From the game history, Player 1 has rejected several of my offers (e.g., 1 Sheep for 1 Ore) but accepted one (1 Brick and 1 Sheep for 1 Ore), indicating they are selective and likely evaluating value similarly. I should adjust offers incrementally\u2014escalating or modifying based on past rejections\u2014to avoid stalemates. With only 10 turns total, I need to be efficient, proposing trades quickly rather than defaulting to denial, to maximize opportunities.\n\n4. **Risk Management and Reciprocity**: Avoid overcommitting high-value resources in early trades, as this could leave me vulnerable. Instead, use reciprocity: since Player 1 just accepted a trade, they might be more open to another if it feels fair. Calculate risks by reviewing patterns\u2014Player 1 rejected unbalanced offers, so I should aim for perceived fairness while ensuring my net gain. Finally, if no offer is incoming, proactively make one to keep the game moving.\n\n5. **Game Context Insights**: The game has a fixed number of turns, so I must act decisively. My current resources show strengths in Brick and Sheep (higher quantities and values), which I can trade for rarer items like Ore to amplify my total value. Historical data shows Player 1 is interested in my Brick and Sheep but not at any cost, so I can refine offers to make them more appealing without sacrificing too much value.\n\nIn summary, these principles emphasize calculated, value-driven decisions, leveraging my resource strengths, and adapting to the other player's behavior to ensure long-term gains.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision:\nApplying the above knowledge, I need to propose a new trade that increases my total resource value while building on Player 1's recent acceptance. From the game history, Player 1 accepted my offer of 1 Brick and 1 Sheep for 1 Ore, suggesting they value Brick highly. However, that trade resulted in a net value loss for me (gave: 1 Brick at 29 + 1 Sheep at 15 = 44; received: 1 Ore at 37; net loss of 7). To avoid future losses, I'll propose a trade where I gain more value.\n\nMy current resources (after the last trade):\n- Wheat: 24 qty (value 6 each)\n- Wood: 10 qty (value 11 each)\n- Sheep: 11 qty (value 15 each)  [updated from 12 after previous trade]\n- Brick: 12 qty (value 29 each)  [updated from 13]\n- Ore: 7 qty (value 37 each)  [updated from 6]\n\nI have surplus Wheat and Wood, which are lower value, so I'll use them in this offer to minimize my loss while targeting Ore. Specifically, I'll offer 5 Wheat (total value: 5 * 6 = 30) for 1 Ore (value: 37), resulting in a net gain of 7 value for me. This builds reciprocity by offering something Player 1 might not value highly, while addressing my need for high-value resources. It's a low-risk move given the limited turns.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nBefore making a trading decision, I'll outline key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are relevant to my current situation as Player 0. This is based on general negotiation theory, resource valuation, and the history of this game.\n\n- **Value Maximization Principle**: The primary goal is to ensure that any trade increases the total value of my resources. I must calculate the net value gain or loss for each potential trade by comparing the value of resources I'm offering against those I'm requesting. For instance, my resources have the following per-unit values: Wheat (6), Wood (11), Sheep (15), Brick (29), and Ore (37). I should only proceed with trades where the incoming value exceeds the outgoing value to avoid losses, as seen in my previous accepted trade (I gave 1 Brick and 1 Sheep for 1 Ore, netting a loss of 7 value points).\n\n- **Scarcity and Opportunity Cost**: Resources like Ore (high value at 37 per unit) are scarce and highly desirable, so I should be cautious about demanding them unless I can offer a compelling deal. Conversely, I have abundant low-value resources like Wheat (24 units), which I can use as leverage in trades without significantly depleting my stock. I should prioritize trading excess low-value resources (e.g., Wheat or Wood) for higher-value ones to improve my overall portfolio.\n\n- **Negotiation Strategy and History Analysis**: From the game history, Player 1 has rejected several offers (e.g., 5 Wheat for 1 Ore) but accepted one (1 Brick and 1 Sheep for 1 Ore), indicating they value their Ore highly and may require offers exceeding its value to them. A good strategy is to start with incremental adjustments to rejected offers\u2014sweeten the deal slightly without overcommitting\u2014to test their boundaries. Avoid repeating failed offers; instead, diversify by combining resources (e.g., mixing Wheat with Wood) to make the offer more attractive. Since the game only has 10 turns, I need to be efficient and avoid prolonged rejections.\n\n- **Risk Management**: There's a risk of rejection if the offer doesn't align with Player 1's needs or valuations. I should aim for offers that provide mutual benefit but prioritize my gains. If an offer is rejected multiple times, consider pivoting to less valuable requests (e.g., Brick instead of Ore) or denying if no incoming offer is viable. Always track inventory changes, as my current resources are: Wheat (24 qty), Wood (10 qty), Sheep (11 qty), Brick (12 qty), and Ore (7 qty).\n\n- **Psychological and Game-Specific Insights**: Players often respond to persistence with slight concessions, so building on accepted trades (like the one for Ore) could work. However, since Player 1 rejected my last offer of 5 Wheat for 1 Ore (offering 30 value for 37 value), I need to offer slightly more perceived value to them while minimizing my loss. Aim for trades that are close to break-even or slightly positive for me to maintain long-term viability in the limited turns.\n\nThis knowledge guides me to make calculated offers that prioritize net value gain, leverage my abundance, and learn from past interactions.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge, I'll evaluate my options. My previous offer of 5 Wheat (30 value) for 1 Ore (37 value) was rejected, indicating Player 1 wants more than 30 value for their Ore. I need to increase the offered value slightly to make it appealing while keeping my loss minimal. Offering 4 Wheat (24 value) and 1 Wood (11 value) totals 35 value, which is just above the 30 value they previously rejected, potentially tipping the scales. This gives me 1 Ore (37 value) in return, resulting in a net loss of only 2 value points\u2014better than my last trade's 7-point loss and still uses my abundant resources.\n\nSince there's no incoming offer from Player 1 to accept or deny, I'll make a new offer.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nBefore making a trading decision, I'll outline key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are relevant to my current situation as Player 0. This is based on my resources, past trades, and the goal of increasing my total resource value.\n\n- **Value-Based Trading Principle**: Always calculate the net value gain or loss for any trade. My resources have specific values (e.g., Wheat at 6 per unit, Ore at 37 per unit), so I should only propose or accept trades where the total value of resources I receive exceeds what I give. For instance, in my previous accepted trade (1 Brick and 1 Sheep for 1 Ore), I experienced a net loss (gave 44 value, received 37 value), which highlights the need to prioritize positive-value exchanges to meet the game's objective.\n\n- **Negotiation Adjustment Strategy**: Analyze past rejections to refine offers. Player 1 has rejected several of my offers (e.g., 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, and 4 Wheat + 1 Wood for 1 Ore), suggesting they value their resources differently or demand a better deal. I should incrementally adjust by offering slightly more value to make the trade appealing while still aiming for a net gain. Starting with conservative offers and escalating can build rapport, but with only 10 turns total, I must avoid over-giving.\n\n- **Resource Scarcity and Leverage Insight**: Prioritize trading abundant, lower-value resources (like Wheat, which I have 24 of) for scarce, high-value ones (like Ore, valued at 37). This diversifies my portfolio and maximizes growth. However, I should protect high-value resources (e.g., Brick at 29) unless the return justifies it, as seen in my earlier loss. Understanding Player 1's preferences (they accepted 1 Brick + 1 Sheep for 1 Ore, indicating they might value Brick and Sheep highly) allows me to use this to my advantage.\n\n- **Turn Efficiency Consideration**: With the game limited to 10 turns, I need to be proactive yet strategic. Prolonged rejections could waste turns, so my offers should balance aggressiveness with realism to encourage acceptance while ensuring I don't deplete resources unnecessarily.\n\n- **Risk Management in Negotiation**: Avoid patterns that lead to consistent losses. For example, my history shows Player 1 rejects offers where I gain value (e.g., 1 Sheep for 1 Ore), so I may need to test boundaries by offering a mix of resources that slightly overcompensates in their perceived value but still results in a small net gain for me.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge, I'll focus on trading my abundant, lower-value resources (Wheat and possibly Wood or Sheep) for high-value Ore, as Ore has the highest individual value (37) and could significantly boost my total value. From past trades, Player 1 rejected my offer of 4 Wheat and 1 Wood for 1 Ore (value given: 35, received: 37, slight gain for me), so I'll adjust by offering a bit more value to make it enticing while ensuring I still achieve a net gain.\n\n- Proposed Trade Calculation: I'll offer 3 Wheat and 1 Sheep for 1 Ore.\n  - Value given: 3 Wheat (3 \u00d7 6 = 18) + 1 Sheep (1 \u00d7 15 = 15) = Total 33\n  - Value received: 1 Ore (1 \u00d7 37 = 37)\n  - Net gain: 37 - 33 = +4 (a small positive gain, aligning with my goal)\n\nThis offer uses my abundant Wheat and a moderate amount of Sheep, which Player 1 has shown interest in (from the accepted trade). It adjusts from the rejected offer by including Sheep instead of Wood, potentially making it more appealing based on Player 1's history, while still resulting in a net value increase for me.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
