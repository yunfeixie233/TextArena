      "response": "Knowledge  \n1. Value Trumps Any Other Metric  \n   A trade is \u201cgood\u201d only if your total point-value after the trade is strictly higher than before.  \n   Example: My Brick costs me 1 point each (24 / 24 = 1). Ore costs 4.125 points each. Therefore swapping 1 Ore is only worthwhile if I receive **more than 4.125 Brick** per Ore (or the equivalent value in some other commodity).  \n\n2. Focus My Over-Supplied Resources  \n   I have 24 Sheep and 24 Brick (both the highest counts of goods that I personally value the least). They are my natural \u201cgive\u201d candidates. The low-value Wheat (5 pts total) is literally not even worth offering \u2014 it is better off used defensively or ignored.  \n\n3. Understand the Opponents\u2019 Likely Needs  \n   \u2022 Sheep, Wood and Brick are the classic \u201cbuilding\u201d trifecta. Because Wood and Brick together make roads and settlements, some player probably hungers for my Brick even if they already have Sheep.  \n   \u2022 Ore is the late-game bottleneck: very likely any Player with cities already built will desperately want more Ore. I should therefore be extremely reluctant to ship Ore unless I can extract more than its 33/8 \u2248 4.125 points per unit.  \n\n4. Propose Trades that Seem \u201cWin-Win\u201d on the Surface, but Favour Me  \n   Framing matters: giving up \u201conly\u201d 1-2 of my least-valuable resources for 3-5 of an opponent\u2019s surplus (but still low-value for them) resources looks reasonable to them yet yields me net gains.  \n\n5. Sequence Across Turns  \n   A good strategy is to fish early in the game with modest offers \u2014 see who bites \u2014 then escalate or renegotiate. If nobody responds, I can still pivot next turn without damage.\n\nApplied Decision  \nCalculate a minimal experimental offer that promises me a guaranteed net gain while still looking friendly.  \n\u2022 Give: 3 Sheep (3\u00d714/24 \u2248 1.75 points each \u2192 5.25 total)  \n         2 Ore    (2\u00d733/8  \u2248 8.25 points each \u2192 16.5 total)  \n         Combined outgoing value = 21.75  \n\n\u2022 Ask: 5 Brick (5\u00d724/24 = 5 total points)  \n        2 Sheep (2\u00d714/24 \u2248 1.17 points each \u2192 2.33 total)  \n        Combined incoming value = 7.33  \n\nWait \u2014 my outgoing value (21.75) dwarfs incoming (7.33)! That would be a huge loss. I must ask for **much more Brick** to offset the Ore sacrifice.  \n\nRecalculate safely: for every Ore (\u2248 4.125) I can accept **up to 4 Brick** to break even. But because Sheep is inexpensive to me (1.17 each) I might use it to sweeten the pot without hurting. Balanced ratio:  \n\nOffer that gives me **net value gain**:  \n\nOutgoing: 3 Sheep (5.25)  \nIncoming: 7 Brick (7)  \nNet gain: +1.75  \n\nAlternatively, check Ore-free offers first to avoid giving away scarce Ore:  \n\nOutgoing: 5 Sheep (5\u00d71.75 = 8.75)  \nIncoming: 9 Brick (9\u00d71 = 9)  \nNet gain: +0.25  \n\nStill tiny, but Ore is left untouched. However 5 Sheep for 9 Brick is visually implausible to most players. To maximise acceptance odds without risking Ore I will try the version:  \n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 7 Brick]\n\nThis still nets me a positive 1.75 points and keeps my Ore intact.\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 7 Brick]",

This suggests they are valuing Brick highly but are not willing to pay a fair price for 7 units yet.\n*   **Turn Limit:** 10 turns. This means I shouldn't be *too* patient if good opportunities arise, but also shouldn't rush into bad deals. I have plenty of turns to find good trades.\n\nTrading Decision:\nThe current offer from Player 0 (5 Sheep, 3 Wheat for 7 Brick) is a very poor deal for me. I would lose 102 in value. Since Player 0 seems to really want Brick, I can leverage that. I will counter with an offer that still includes Brick but at a much better value ratio for *me*. I have a lot of Brick, so I can afford to trade some if the return is good. I want to trade fewer Brick for more valuable resources or a lower quantity of Brick for the same items offered.\n\nConsidering I have 18 Brick, and its value is 26, giving up 7 Brick is a lot. Player 0 seems to be trying to get a large quantity of Brick cheaply. Let's try to get more valuable resources in return for *fewer* Brick.\n\nProposal: I will offer fewer Brick and request more valuable resources, or a different combination.\nMy Brick is 26. Ore is 32. Sheep is 13. Wood is 12. Wheat is 5.\n\nIf Player 0 wants Brick, let's try offering a smaller quantity of Brick, say 2 or 3, for something of much higher value.\n*   Offering 2 Brick (Value: 52) for what? Player 0 offered 5 Sheep (65) + 3 Wheat (15) = 80.\n    If I request 2 Ore (Value: 64) for 2 Brick (Value: 52), it's a win for me (12 value gain) and good for Player 0 if they need Ore. But they seem to want Brick.\n\nLet's stick to the Brick for their Sheep/Wheat structure but improve the ratio dramatically.\nTheir offer: 5 Sheep (65) + 3 Wheat (15) = 80, for 7 Brick (182). LOSS = 102.\n\nMy counter: How much Brick would I give for 5 Sheep + 3 Wheat?\nValue of their offer: 80.\nValue of 3 Brick: 3 * 26 = 78. This is almost even. (Player 0 gets a slight value gain of 2 if they accept this, but I avoid the massive loss).\nThis is a reasonable counter if I want to make a deal.\n\nHowever, given Player 0's persistence in getting Brick, I might be able to get even more valuable resources for my Brick. I have plenty of Ore (16) and it's my highest value resource (32). I also have plenty of Brick (18).\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nIf I offer 3 Brick ($78) to get 2 Ore ($64), it's a loss for me.\nIf I offer 2 Brick ($52) to get 2 Ore ($64), it's a gain for me ($12). And Player 0 still gets Brick.\n\nLet's consider that Player 0 is also trying to increase their value. My counter needs to be appealing.\nTheir initial request was 7 Brick. My counter should aim for less Brick provided by me.\n\nLet's try this: Offer 3 Brick (Value: 78) for 2 Ore (Value: 64) and 1 Sheep (Value: 13) = 77. This is nearly even for me (-1 value) and Player 0 gets Brick. But I want a net gain.\n\nLet's go back to their last offer: 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat for 7 Brick.\nI refuse this. I will make a counter offer that values my Brick much more.\nI have a lot of Brick.\nWhat if I offer a smaller quantity of Brick for something more valuable to *me*?\nI could try to get Ore.\n\nOffer: 2 Brick (Value: 52)\nRequest: 2 Ore (Value: 64)\nNet gain for me: +12. Player 0 still gets Brick, which they seem to want, and they give up highly valuable Ore. This shows I value my Brick highly.\n\nLet's try this refined counter.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 2 Ore]",

I should pursue acquiring Ore if possible, or at least avoid losing high-value resources like Brick for low value.\n\nMy current resources:\n+ [Wheat] Qty: 18 Value: 5 (Total: 90)\n+ [Wood] Qty: 13 Value: 12 (Total: 156)\n+ [Sheep] Qty: 11 Value: 13 (Total: 143)\n+ [Brick] Qty: 18 Value: 26 (Total: 468)\n+ [Ore] Qty: 16 Value: 32 (Total: 512)\n\nTotal Value: 1369\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore (Value: 103)\nPlayer 0 requested: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep (Value: 156)\n\nThis trade is bad for me. Player 0 seems desperate for Brick. I have 18 Brick, which is a good quantity. I also have 11 Sheep.\n\nI should try to get more high-value resources. Since Player 0 offered Ore, they might be willing to offer it again.\nWhat if I offer some Sheep and Brick, but try to get back Ore and maybe some higher-value items or avoid losing value?\nPlayer 0 has previously offered Sheep for Brick. They seem to value Brick very highly.\n\nLet's make an offer where I get more Ore or other high-value items, and give away some Sheep or low-value items.\nPerhaps I can trade some Brick, but ensure I get enough value in return.\n\nConsider a trade that gets me some Ore, or trades low-value for high-value.\nI have a lot of Brick. Can I trade some Brick for Ore?\nMy offer two turns ago: 2 Brick -> 2 Ore (Value: My loss +52, My gain +64. Net +12). Player 0 rejected this.\n\nPlayer 0 seems to want Brick badly. I have 18 Brick.\nWhat if I offer 3 Brick (Value 78) for 2 Ore (Value 64) and 1 Wood (Value 12)? This is 78 for 76. Almost even, maybe slightly in my favor as I have plenty of Brick.\nI have too much Brick, so reducing it slightly might make sense if I get good value back.\n\nWhat if I offer to swap some Brick for another high-value resource?\nOr focus on getting rid of Sheep / Wheat for high-value?\nI have plenty of Wood and Wheat too.\n\nPlayer 0 is offering 2 Ore, which is good. But they want 5 Brick and 2 Sheep.\nI will deny this and make a new offer that is more beneficial.\n\nMy goal: increase value.\nI have plenty of Brick (18), Sheep (11), Wheat (18).\nI want more high-value items, especially Ore (Value 32).\n\nWhat if I counter offering my Sheep and some Brick to get Ore?\nOffer: 5 Sheep, 2 Brick (Value: 5*13 + 2*26 = 65 + 52 = 117)\nRequest: 4 Ore, 1 Wood (Value: 4*32 + 1*12 = 128 + 12 = 140)\nThis would be a net gain of 23 for me. I would reduce my Sheep and Brick, and gain a lot of Ore and a little Wood. This seems reasonable given Player 0's apparent desire for Brick and willingness to offer Ore.\n\nFinal Check:\nOffer: 5 Sheep (Qty 11 -> 6), 2 Brick (Qty 18 -> 16). Resources I have in relative abundance.\nRequest: 4 Ore (Qty 16 -> 20), 1 Wood (Qty 13 -> 14). Ore is my most valuable, Wood is ok.\nValue out: 5*13 + 2*26 = 65 + 52 = 117\nValue in: 4*32 + 1*12 = 128 + 12 = 140\nNet gain: 140 - 117 = +23.\n\nThis looks like a solid offer.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 4 Ore, 1 Wood]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value-based Trading:** My primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Every trade must be evaluated on its immediate net value gain.\n2.  **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:** I have a good quantity of Wheat and Brick, and decent amounts of Wood, Sheep, and Ore. Ore has the highest value per unit, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and Wheat. This suggests I should be more willing to trade away lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) for higher-value resources (Brick, Ore), especially if I have many of them.\n3.  **Understanding Opponent's Offers:** Player 0 has consistently offered Sheep and/or Wheat for Brick and/or Ore and Wood. This indicates they likely value Brick, Ore, and Wood highly, and possibly have an abundance of Sheep/Wheat. This confirms my strategy to acquire Brick/Ore.\n4.  **Identifying Good Trades:** A good trade is one where the total value of resources I receive is greater than the total value of resources I give up.\n5.  **Small Incremental Gains:** Even small value gains add up over 10 turns. Don't wait for a \"perfect\" trade if a good one is available.\n6.  **Persistence and Adjustment:** My previous offers involving Brick for Ore were rejected. Player 0 rejected an offer of 2 Brick for 2 Ore (Value 52 out for 64 in). Player 0 also rejected 5 Sheep, 2 Brick for 4 Ore, 1 Wood (Value 111 out for 140 in). This indicates they either value Brick very highly or are unwilling to give up significant amounts of Ore/Wood for those resources. They have been offering Sheep, and often want Brick.\n7.  **Evaluating the Current Offer:** Player 0's current offer: \"Offered items: 4 Sheep, 1 Brick -> Requested items: 2 Ore, 1 Wood\".\n    *   Value of items offered by Player 0 to me: (4 * 13) + (1 * 26) = 52 + 26 = 78\n    *   Value of items requested by Player 0 from me: (2 * 32) + (1 * 12) = 64 + 12 = 76\n    *   Net value change for me if I accept: +78 - 76 = +2.\n    *   This is a positive value gain for me. It's a small gain, but a gain nonetheless, and it helps me convert some of my Brick into higher-value Ore. I have 18 Brick, so giving up 1 is not detrimental. I have 16 Ore, and getting 2 more is good. I have 13 Wood, and getting 1 more is okay.\n\nTrading Decision:\nThe current offer from Player 0 provides a positive value gain of 2. While small, it moves me in the right direction (gaining valuable Ore) and I have enough resources to make the trade without significantly depleting any essential type.\n\n[Accept]",

Convergence on Fair Ratios \u2013 Looking at the five rejected offers (5 Sheep\u21927 Brick, 5 Sheep+3 Wheat\u21927 Brick, 3 Sheep+2 Ore\u21925 Brick+2 Sheep, etc.), Player 1 signals that Brick:Ore is more like 1:0.8\u20130.9, not the earlier 1:0.5 you were demanding.  Re-evaluate your willingness to give up Brick for less-than-market rates.  \n3. Redundancy & Scarcity \u2013 You are **abundant** in Sheep (24), Brick (24), Wheat (16).  Ore (8) and Wood (6) are your clear bottlenecks.  Converting excess Sheep/Brick into scarcer Ore/Wood will nearly always increase **your total point value**.  \n4. Exploit Asymmetrical Value \u2013 Because you have many Sheep and Brick but few Ore, trades that **give away Sheep/Brick and receive Ore/Wood** look poor to the opponent but may be your highest EV (Expected Value) moves.  \n5. Gradual Concessions \u2013 You just traded 4 Sheep (56pt loss) + 1 Brick (24pt loss) for 2 Ore (66pt gain) + 1 Wood (10pt gain).  Net change: \u221256 \u221224 +66 +10 = \u22124.  This small loss is acceptable to rebalance your portfolio toward scarce goods.  Continue small, repeatable trades in that direction rather than one big swing.\n\nApplied Decision\nBecause Player 1 offered nothing new and your holdings are still heavy in Sheep/Brick while weak in Ore/Wood, I will float the exact same type of trade again.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]",

Ore and Brick are my most valuable resources per unit. Wheat is the least valuable.\n3.  **Understanding Opponent's Offer:** Player 0 is offering \"3 Sheep, 2 Ore\" for \"5 Brick, 2 Sheep\".\n    *   **Offered (from P0 to P1):** 3 Sheep (3 * 13 = 39) + 2 Ore (2 * 32 = 64) = 103 total value.\n    *   **Requested (from P1 to P0):** 5 Brick (5 * 26 = 130) + 2 Sheep (2 * 13 = 26) = 156 total value.\n    *   **Net Value for P1 if accepted:** P1 receives 103 value, gives away 156 value. This is a net loss of 53 value (103 - 156 = -53).\n4.  **Strategic Refusal:** This offer from Player 0 is clearly disadvantageous for me in terms of value. I should deny it.\n5.  **Proposing Counter-Offers (Next Turn Consideration):** Since Player 0 seems persistent in offering Ore (which I value highly) but wants Brick (which I also value highly), I need to find a way to get Ore without giving up too much high-value resources. I have ample Wheat, which is low value. I should try to offload Wheat in exchange for higher-value resources like Ore or Wood, or even offer some amount of Sheep/Wood for Ore/Brick, but always ensuring a positive value gain.\n6.  **Current Resources and Inventory:** I have a decent amount of all resources. My Brick and Ore are high, but they are also high value. I have a lot of Wheat and Brick. I can afford to trade some Brick for higher value items if the ratio is right, but not at a loss like the current offer.\n7.  **Past Turn Analysis:**\n    *   Last turn, Player 0's offer of \"4 Sheep, 1 Brick\" for \"2 Ore, 1 Wood\" was *accepted*.\n        *   Value received (4 Sheep + 1 Brick) = (4*13) + (1*26) = 52 + 26 = 78.\n        *   Value given (2 Ore + 1 Wood) = (2*32) + (1*12) = 64 + 12 = 76.\n        *   Net gain = +2. This was a slight value gain for me. This indicates Player 0 might be willing to take a small loss or break even to get desired resources.\n\nBased on the analysis, Player 0's current offer is very unfavorable to me. I should reject it. I will not make a new offer this turn, as the prompt only asks for an action to the current offer.\n\nDeny: The offer from Player 0 would result in a significant loss of value for Player 1.\n\n[Deny]",
