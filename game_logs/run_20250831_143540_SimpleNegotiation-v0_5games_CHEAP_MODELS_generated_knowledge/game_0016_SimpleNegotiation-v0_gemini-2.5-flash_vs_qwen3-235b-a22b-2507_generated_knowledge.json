      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. **Objective:** My primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade I make or accept must result in a net gain in value.\n2. **Resource Valuation:** I have a clear understanding of the value of each resource. This is crucial for calculating the value of potential trades.\n3. **Scarcity and Demand (Implicit):** While not explicitly stated, in a negotiation game, resources might have different utility or demand for other players. This can influence their willingness to trade. High-value resources might be harder to acquire, or easier to offload for more value.\n4. **Opportunity Cost:** What am I giving up versus what am I getting? Is there a better trade I could make?\n5. **Proposing Offers:** When proposing, I should aim for a significant value gain for myself, while making the offer appealing enough for the other player to consider. This often involves offering resources with lower value to me (or in greater quantity) for resources with higher value to me (or in smaller quantity).\n6. **Understanding Player 1's Perspective:** Player 1 also wants to increase their total value. My offers should ideally present a value gain for them as well, even if smaller, or offer resources they might need more than I do.\n7. **Strategic Use of Quantities:** Large quantities of low-value items might be exchanged for smaller quantities of high-value items if the value proposition is right.\n8. **Avoiding Loss-Making Trades:** Never propose or accept a trade that decreases my total value.\n9. **Identifying \"Weak\" Resources:** Resources with low value (Wheat, Wood) are good candidates to offer for higher-value ones. Resources with high value (Brick, Ore) are good candidates to request.\n10. **Assessing \"Strong\" Resources:** I have a good quantity of Wood (22) and Wheat (15), which are my lower-value resources. Brick (14) and Ore (8) are my highest value resources. Sheep (5) is middling and has a low quantity. My high quantity of Wood and Wheat makes them good candidates for offering in trades. My high value Brick and Ore are ideal targets to acquire more of, or to trade for something even more valuable if possible.\n\nTrading Decision:\nMy strategy will be to trade my lower-value, higher-quantity resources (Wood, Wheat) for higher-value resources (Brick, Ore). I have a lot of Wood, which is my second lowest value resource. Brick and Ore are my highest value.\n\nI will propose a trade where I give up a significant amount of Wood and/or Wheat for a smaller amount of a high-value resource, ensuring a good net value gain for myself.\n\nLet's calculate some potential trades:\n*   Current Total Value: (15*6) + (22*10) + (5*16) + (14*30) + (8*37) = 90 + 220 + 80 + 420 + 296 = 1106\n\n*   **Option 1 (Wood for Brick/Ore):**\n    *   Offer: 10 Wood (Value: 100)\n    *   Request: 3 Brick (Value: 90) or 2 Ore (Value: 74)\n    *   This is a value loss for me. Not good. I need to make sure the requested resources' value is higher than the offered.\n\n*   **Option 2 (Wood for Brick/Ore):**\n    *   Offer: 10 Wood (Value: 100)\n    *   Request: 4 Brick (Value: 120) or 3 Ore (Value: 111)\n    *   This looks promising.\n        *   Trade 10 Wood (100) for 4 Brick (120): Net gain of 20 value. (Leaves me with 12 wood)\n        *   Trade 10 Wood (100) for 3 Ore (111): Net gain of 11 value. (Leaves me with 12 wood)\n\n*   **Option 3 (Wheat and Wood for Ore):**\n    *   Offer: 8 Wheat (48) + 5 Wood (50) = 98 value\n    *   Request: 3 Ore (111 value)\n    *   Net gain of 13 value.\n\nI want to aim for a significant value increase but also consider what the other player might accept. My Wood is plentiful.\n\nLet's try to get more high-value resources.\n\n\"[Offer: 12 Wood -> 4 Brick]\"\nValue Offered: 12 * 10 = 120\nValue Requested: 4 * 30 = 120\nThis is a neutral value trade. Not good enough for my objective.\n\nI need a net gain for myself.\n\n\"[Offer: 12 Wood -> 5 Brick]\"\nValue Offered: 12 * 10 = 120\nValue Requested: 5 * 30 = 150\nNet Gain: 30. This is a good gain for me, but might be too steep for Player 1.\n\nLet's try a smaller increment but still a gain.\n\"[Offer: 10 Wood -> 4 Brick]\"\nValue Offered: 10 * 10 = 100\nValue Requested: 4 * 30 = 120\nNet Gain: 20. This is a reasonable value gain for me, and Player 1 gets 10 Wood, which they might need.\n\nLet's consider combining resources. What if I offer some low-value Wheat too?\n\n\"[Offer: 8 Wheat, 8 Wood -> 4 Ore]\"\nValue Offered: (8 * 6) + (8 * 10) = 48 + 80 = 128\nValue Requested: 4 * 37 = 148\nNet Gain: 20. This is also good. It uses up some of my Wheat.\n\nI will go with an offer that leverages my plentiful Wood and aims for a high-value resource. Getting more Brick is good because it's high value and I have a significant quantity already, making it a stronger resource for me.\n\nMy primary goal is to increase total value, and targeting Brick or Ore for my lower-value resources is the way to go.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 4 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \nIn resource-based negotiation games, several key principles apply:\n\n1. **Value Asymmetry**: The core of successful trading lies in exploiting differences in perceived resource value between players. Even if a trade appears balanced in quantity, differences in individual resource utility can make a trade beneficial for both sides.\n\n2. **High-Value Resource Preservation**: Resources with high individual value (like Ore here at 37) are typically scarcer and more powerful in end-game strategies. Exchanging excess high-value resources should only occur if the return significantly outweighs opportunity cost.\n\n3. **Resource Utility & Scarcity**: Consider not just the value, but also the quantity. While Ore is valuable, having only 8 units means each is critical. Conversely, Wood (value 10) is abundant (24 units), so trading excess Wood can be acceptable if it acquires higher-value or scarce resources.\n\n4. **Trade Efficiency**: The best trades optimize total portfolio value. Giving up low-value, high-quantity resources to gain high-value, low-quantity ones generally increases total value.\n\n5. **Counterparty Incentives**: The offer from Player 0\u201412 Wood for 4 Brick\u2014suggests Player 0 highly values Brick (value 29). Giving up 4 Brick would cost me 4 \u00d7 29 = 116 value, while receiving 12 Wood adds only 12 \u00d7 10 = 120 value. The net gain is minimal (only +4 value), and Wood is already in surplus (24 \u2192 36). This trade increases quantity but not strategic value.\n\n6. **Opportunity Cost**: Using 4 Brick in trade means losing potential high-value actions (e.g., building). Brick is already limited (13 units), so giving up 4 is a 30% reduction. Meanwhile, Wood surplus can be used later more efficiently.\n\n7. **Strategic Positioning**: Instead of accepting offers that marginally improve value, crafting offers that target undervalued resources (to me) but high-value to others can unlock better trades. For example, offering lower-value surplus (Wood, Wheat) for high-value scarce resources (Ore, Sheep) would be ideal.\n\nConclusion: Player 0\u2019s offer has low net value gain and erodes my Brick reserves, which are high-value and limited. Accepting it offers minimal benefit. Denial preserves advantage. Instead, I should wait or make my own strategic offer.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value-Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any exchange should result in me gaining more value than I give up.\n2.  **Scarcity and Demand:** Resources with higher individual values (Ore, Brick, Sheep) are generally more desirable. Understanding which resources the *other player* might value highly (even if their individual value to me is lower) can facilitate trades.\n3.  **Marginal Utility:** The value of a resource might change based on its quantity. Having a very large quantity of a low-value resource (e.g., Wheat) might make me more willing to trade it for something else, even if the direct value exchange isn't perfectly symmetrical, as long as I still come out ahead overall. Conversely, having very few of a high-value resource makes me less willing to trade it away.\n4.  **Offer Structure:** Offers should be clear and directly compare what I'm giving with what I want. Highlighting the benefit to the other player can be effective.\n5.  **Understanding Rejection:** The previous offer (12 Wood for 4 Brick) was rejected. This suggests either:\n    *   Player 1 did not value 12 Wood as much as 4 Brick. (My Wood value: 12*10=120. Requested Brick value: 4*30=120. This was a neutral value trade for me, but maybe not attractive enough for them, or they don't need Wood.)\n    *   Player 1 doesn't have 4 Brick to spare or values their Brick much higher.\n    *   The quantities were too high or too low.\n6.  **Information Asymmetry:** I don't know Player 1's resource inventory or their individual resource values. My offers are essentially probing their needs and willingness to trade.\n7.  **Negotiation Flexibility:** Be prepared to adjust offers based on rejections or counter-offers. Small incremental changes or different resource combinations might be more successful.\n8.  **Leverage Redundant Resources:** I have a relatively high quantity of Wheat (15, value 6) and Wood (22, value 10). These are good candidates for trading, especially if I can exchange them for higher-value items.\n9.  **Target High-Value Gains:** My highest value resources are Ore (37) and Brick (30). Acquiring more of these, or trading less valuable resources for them, is a priority. Sheep (16) are also good.\n10. **Avoid Zero-Sum Thinking Initially:** While I want to maximize my value, a trade should also appeal to the other player. Looking for mutually beneficial exchanges, especially early on, can build trust or open avenues for future trades.\n\nTrading Decision:\nMy previous offer of 12 Wood for 4 Brick was rejected. This suggests Player 1 may not need Wood, or values Brick highly. Given my large stock of Wheat and Wood, I should try to offload some of these for higher-value items. Brick (value 30) is a great target, and I have a decent quantity (14), but I'd rather trade my lower-value resources for it. I also have a fair amount of Wheat.\n\nLet's try trading Wheat for Brick, as Wheat has a very low individual value to me but I have a high quantity. I can afford to be generous with Wheat if it means getting high-value Brick.\n\nI'll try offering a large quantity of Wheat for a smaller quantity of Brick, aiming for an increase in total value.\nMy Wheat value: 6. Brick value: 30.\nTo break even on value from my perspective, 5 Wheat (30 value) = 1 Brick (30 value).\nI want to *gain* value, so I need to offer *less* than 5 Wheat for 1 Brick, or offer 5 Wheat for *more* than 1 Brick.\nOr, more likely, offer multiple units of a low-value item for a single unit of a high-value item, ensuring my total value increases.\n\nLet's aim for a clear value increase.\nIf I offer 7 Wheat (Value 42) for 2 Brick (Value 60), I gain 18 value. This is a decent gain for me.\nIt might be hard for them to accept 7 Wheat for 2 Brick if they value Brick highly.\n\nConsider trading Wood again, as I have a lot. If they rejected 12 Wood for 4 Brick, maybe they want other resources.\nWhat if I try to trade for Ore?\n\nLet's try an offer that leverages my high quantity of Wood and targets a high-value resource like Ore.\n22 Wood (10 value each) Total Wood value: 220\n8 Ore (37 value each) Total Ore value: 296\n\nIf I offer 10 Wood (value 100) for 3 Ore (value 111), I gain 11 value. This is reasonable.\n\nLet's rethink the previous trade rejection more carefully. 12 Wood (value 120) for 4 Brick (value 120). This was a fair trade *in terms of my own values*. Player 1 might have rejected it because:\n1. They don't need Wood.\n2. They don't have 4 Brick to spare.\n3. They value Brick *higher* than my listed value.\n4. They simply want a better deal for themselves.\n\nGiven Player 1 rejected an offer of 12 Wood for 4 Brick, they might not be interested in Wood.\nI have a ton of Wheat (15). Let's go for trading Wheat, as it's my lowest individually valued resource and I have the most.\nIf I can trade Wheat for Brick or Ore, that's ideal.\n\nTarget: Brick or Ore\nResources to offer: Wheat (15, value 6), Wood (22, value 10)\n\nOffer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Brick\nMy Value Out: 8 * 6 = 48\nMy Value In: 1 * 30 = 30\nThis would be a loss for me. Not good.\n\nOffer: 12 Wheat -> 3 Sheep\nMy Value Out: 12 * 6 = 72\nMy Value In: 3 * 16 = 48\nAlso a loss for me.\n\nI need to gain value.\nHow about offering a mix of low-value resources for a single high-value resource?\n\nLet's try a modest offer of Wood for Ore again, maybe a smaller quantity is more appealing. Player 1 didn't offer anything back, so I need to continue to probe.\n\nOffer: 6 Wood -> 2 Ore\nMy value out: 6 * 10 = 60\nMy value in: 2 * 37 = 74\nValue gained: 14. This is a solid gain for me. This also asks for just two units of a high-value resource, which might be more accessible for Player 1.\n\nFinal check on resources:\nWheat: 15 (6)\nWood: 22 (10) - (plenty to offer 6 of them)\nSheep: 5 (16)\nBrick: 14 (30)\nOre: 8 (37)\n\nThis seems like a fair offer that benefits me and demands a reasonable quantity of a high-value resource.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wood -> 2 Ore]",

Acquiring more of these, especially if I can trade lower-value resources for them efficiently, will be key to increasing my total value.\n*   **Identify Low-Value Resources to Offer:** Wheat and Wood are my lowest value resources. These are good candidates to offer, but only if the gain from the trade outweighs the loss.\n*   **Strategic Offers:**\n    *   **Value Proposition:** Any offer I make should propose a trade where the value of what I am giving up is *less* than the value of what I am asking for. The difference is my potential profit.\n    *   **Player 1's Perspective (Theory of Mind):** While I don't know Player 1's exact resource values or inventory, I can infer they also want to increase their value. My offers should ideally be structured such that they might see a benefit, even if it's slightly less for them than for me. A trade that is *too* lopsided in my favor will likely be rejected.\n    *   **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adjust offers based on rejections. My previous offers of \"12 Wood -> 4 Brick\" (120 value -> 120 value) and \"6 Wood -> 2 Ore\" (60 value -> 74 value) were both rejected. The first was a pure value-for-value swap, which is hard to accept if Player 1 has different values or wants to profit. The second was slightly favorable to me, but perhaps still not appealing enough for Player 1.\n    *   **Scarcity/Utility:** While I don't know Player 1's inventory, resources like Ore and Brick are generally high utility. They might be harder to get from Player 1.\n*   **Quantity Management:** I need to keep enough resources for future trades. Don't deplete a resource entirely unless the trade is exceptionally good. I have a good quantity of Wheat, Wood, and Brick, but less Sheep and Ore.\n*   **Negotiation Tactics:**\n    *   **Starting Bold/Conservative:** My previous offers were somewhat bold. Perhaps a slightly more generous offer (from Player 1's perspective) might elicit an accept.\n    *   **Learning from Rejections:** Rejections tell me my previous offers were not appealing enough. I need to either offer more valuable resources (from my perspective) or ask for fewer high-value resources.\n    *   **Patience vs. Urgency:** The game is 10 turns. I have time, but also need to make progress. Persistent rejections mean I need a new strategy.\n    *   **Identifying Opportunities:** Look for inefficiencies. Is there a resource I have a lot of that I can trade for something I need, even if the value ratio isn't perfect, as long as it's positive?\n*   **Current State Analysis:**\n    *   I have plenty of Wood (22). My previous offers used Wood. It's a low-value resource I can afford to part with.\n    *   I have a decent amount of Brick (14). I can offer some Brick if it gets me more Ore or a better overall deal, but Brick is also high value to me.\n    *   Sheep (5) and Ore (8) are relatively low in quantity, and high in value. I should be very careful offering these unless the return is significant.\n    *   Wheat (15) is plentiful and low value, similar to Wood.\n\nBased on the rejections, Player 1 likely views my offers as not beneficial enough or they might have different valuations/needs. I need to make an offer that is *clearly* beneficial to me, but *also potentially beneficial* to Player 1, or at least not a net loss for them. My earlier offers attempted trades for Brick and Ore, which are good targets. Let's try to improve the offer's appeal to Player 1, while still seeking a value increase.\n\nI could try offering a mix of low-value and a small amount of medium-value for high-value resources.\n\nMy previous offer of 6 Wood (value 60) for 2 Ore (value 74) was rejected. This was a 14 value gain for me. Perhaps it was too aggressive, or Player 1 values Ore very highly and doesn't need Wood.\n\nLet's consider trading Wood and possibly some Wheat for Ore or Brick.\n\nCurrent resources:\nWheat: 15 (Value: 6)\nWood: 22 (Value: 10)\nSheep: 5 (Value: 16)\nBrick: 14 (Value: 30)\nOre: 8 (Value: 37)\n\nIf I want Ore (value 37), I need to give something up for less than 37.\nIf I want Brick (value 30), I need to give something up for less than 30.\n\nI have a lot of Wood. I need to make trades that are more appealing.\n\nConsider offering more Wood for less Ore:\nOffer: 8 Wood (Value: 80) -> 2 Ore (Value: 74). This is a net loss for me. Not good.\n\nWhat if I try to get a better ratio on Brick?\nOffer: 3 Wood (Value: 30) -> 1 Brick (Value: 30). This is a 1:1 value trade, which usually gets rejected.\n\nLet's try to bundle low-value items directly for a high-value item, aiming for a small profit for me but still giving Player 1 a reasonable deal.\n\nHow about offering a higher quantity of low-value resources?\nIf I offer 10 Wood (Value: 100) for 3 Ore (Value: 111), that's a good gain for me (11 value), but 10 wood is a lot. Player 1 would gain 11 value. This might be plausible.\n\nLet's calculate the target value for a request. If I want 1 Ore (37 value), I need to offer less than 37. Maybe 3 Wood (30 value) + 1 Wheat (6 value) = 36 value.\nOffer: 3 Wood, 1 Wheat (Value 36) -> 1 Ore (Value 37).\nThis gives me a +1 value gain. This is extremely tight and probably not interesting enough for Player 1.\n\nI need to aim for a more substantial *percentage* gain or a clearer value gain for me, while still making the offer palatable for Player 1.\nMy goal is to increase my overall resource value.\n\nWhat if I target Brick again, but offer more effectively?\n1 Brick is 30 value.\nI have a lot of Wood.\nOffer: 2 Wood (Value 20) for 1 Brick (Value 30) -> +10 value gain. This is very good for me. Is it too ambitious? Player 1 would lose 10 value. Yes, likely too ambitious.\n\nOffer: 3 Wood (Value 30) for 1 Brick (Value 30). No value gain for me. Rejected before.\n\nLet's try a different resource mix.\nI have 15 Wheat.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (Value 30) for 1 Brick (Value 30). Same as above.\n\nI need to find a sweet spot where I gain value, and Player 1 *might* also gain value (if their internal valuations are different or they simply need the resource), or at least not suffer a significant loss.\n\nPerhaps offering a small amount of a slightly higher-value resource could sweeten a deal.\nExample: 1 Sheep (16 value) + X Wood for Ore/Brick.\n1 Sheep (16) + 1 Wood (10) = 26. Could trade this for 1 Brick (30)?\nOffer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood (Value 26) -> 1 Brick (Value 30). This is a +4 value gain for me.\nThis could be appealing if Player 1 has a surplus of Brick or a high need for Sheep/Wood. I only have 5 Sheep, so offering 1 is significant for me.\n\nLet's consider value differences.\nSheep (16) to Wood (10) is 1.6x.\nBrick (30) to Wood (10) is 3x.\nOre (37) to Wood (10) is 3.7x.\n\nMy previous rejections indicate I need to adjust.\n'12 Wood -> 4 Brick' (120 value -> 120 value for me) - rejected.\n'6 Wood -> 2 Ore' (60 value -> 74 value for me) - rejected.\n\nThe second offer gained me 14 value. It was a good deal for me. Why rejected? Likely Player 1 didn't see the benefit, or my valuation was too skewed compared to theirs, or they have no Ore surplus.\n\nMaybe Player 1 wants a resource I have in higher value? Sheep or even Brick?\nWhat if I offer a small amount of Brick for a proportionally larger amount of Ore?\nOffer: 1 Brick (Value 30) -> 1 Ore (Value 37)?\nThis is +7 value for me. This is good. It implies Player 1 would be willing to trade Ore, which is often considered more valuable. I have 14 Brick, so giving one up is manageable. This assumes Player 1 values Brick less than Ore or needs Brick. This is a plausible strategic move.\n\nLet's consider the reverse for a moment.\nIf I offered 1 Ore (37) for 2 Brick (60), that's a gain for me of 23. But I only have 8 Ore, and it's my highest value resource. Not optimal to offer.\n\nLet's try the \"1 Brick for 1 Ore\" again. (+7 value for me). This is a direct swap of a high-value resource for my highest-value resource, with a gain.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis is a good offer for me. Is it plausible for Player 1? If Player 1 has an abundance of Ore or values Brick more (e.g., to acquire for a specific goal), they might take it. It's concise.\n\nAnother option is to go back to my plentiful Wood and Wheat, but structure the offer differently.\nOffer: 10 Wood (value 100) -> 3 Brick (value 90). This is -10 value for me, bad.\nOffer: 10 Wood (value 100) -> 2 Ore (value 74). This is -26 value for me, bad.\n\nI need a profitable offer. My earlier rejected 6 Wood -> 2 Ore (60 -> 74) was profitable.\nWhat if I offer slightly more wood for a bit less Ore?\nOffer: 7 Wood (value 70) -> 2 Ore (value 74). Still +4 for me. Less ambitious than +14. Might seem fairer to Player 1.\nI still have 22 Wood. Offering 7 is fine.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable next step. It's less aggressive than my initial '6 Wood for 2 Ore', and still nets me a positive gain. It signals I'm willing to offer a bit more (Wood) for the high-value Ore.\n\nI have 22 Wood.\n7 Wood for 2 Ore.\nCurrent Value (Wood): 7 * 10 = 70\nRequested Value (Ore): 2 * 37 = 74\nNet gain for me: 74 - 70 = +4.\n\nThis is a very small value gain, but considering previous rejections, Player 1 might accept a less aggressive trade.\n\nLet's compare to the \"1 Brick -> 1 Ore\" offer.\nValue offered by me: 1 Brick (30)\nValue requested by me: 1 Ore (37)\nNet gain: +7. This is a better gain, but I'm giving up a high-value resource.\n\nI have 14 Brick vs 8 Ore. Giving away 1 Brick to gain Ore and value seems like a strong move. It shifts my portfolio towards the highest value resource.\n\nI will go with the '1 Brick -> 1 Ore' because it offers a higher value gain for me (+7 vs +4 for the wood trade) and a straightforward exchange of high-value goods. It makes sense for me to try to convert Brick directly to Ore, as Ore is my highest value resource.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This means I should always aim for trades where the value of requested items significantly exceeds the value of offered items.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** I have a clear understanding of my resource values. This allows for precise calculation of trade profitability.\n3.  **Scarcity/Demand (Implied):** While I don't know Player 1's inventory or needs, common game theory suggests that more valuable resources are generally scarcer or more in demand. My high-value resources (Ore, Brick, Sheep) are excellent targets for acquisition if I can get them cheaply, or good leverages for trades if I can get a high return. Low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) are good for offering, but I must be careful not to overpay for them.\n4.  **Offer Strategy:**\n    *   **Initial Offers:** Start with offers that are highly favorable to me but not so egregious they shut down negotiation immediately. Test Player 1's valuation of their resources.\n    *   **Increment/Decrement:** If offers are rejected, adjust incrementally. If rejected due to too high a demand or too low an offer, adjust accordingly.\n    *   **Identify Player 1's Valuation:** Repeated rejections of seemingly fair or even favorable offers (to me) suggest Player 1 values their resources differently or has different priorities. I need to try to infer what Player 1 might value.\n    *   **High Value for High Value:** Trading a high quantity of low-value resources for a small quantity of high-value resources is generally good.\n    *   **Equal Value Trades:** A trade where the offered value equals the requested value (or is slightly less for me) might be acceptable if it helps clear out low-value inventory or acquire a resource needed for a larger strategic goal (which isn't explicit here, but is generally true in resource games).\n5.  **Perseverance vs. Flexibility:** I've been rejected multiple times. This means my offers are consistently missing Player 1's acceptable range. I need to be more flexible, either by offering more value or requesting less value, or by changing the resources involved.\n6.  **Current Trade History Analysis:**\n    *   Offer 1: 12 Wood (Val: 120) -> 4 Brick (Val: 120). Rejected. This was an even value trade. Player 1 likely valued Brick higher or didn't need Wood.\n    *   Offer 2: 6 Wood (Val: 60) -> 2 Ore (Val: 74). Rejected. I was trying to get 14 value profit. Player 1 likely valued Ore much higher or didn't want Wood.\n    *   Offer 3: 1 Brick (Val: 30) -> 1 Ore (Val: 37). Rejected. This was a 7 value profit for me, trading a high-value resource for a higher-value one. This rejection is particularly informative. It suggests Player 1 values Ore very highly or is unwilling to give it up for Brick at a 1:1 ratio. It also indicates that even seemingly small, profitable trades from my perspective are not attractive enough for Player 1.\n7.  **Conclusion from history:** Player 1 appears to be valuing their resources much higher than I am offering, especially higher-value resources like Ore and Brick. They are also seemingly not in desperate need of Wood. I need to make offers that are *even more* favorable to Player 1, or identify what resources *they* might want. Since I don't know what they want, I need to try to make my offers more enticing from a pure value perspective for them, or offer resources they might benefit more from. Given the repeated rejections of profitable trades for me, I might need to make a trade that is closer to even value, or even slightly disadvantageous to me *initially* if it helps gain information or establish a trading relationship, but my primary goal remains increasing total value.\n8.  **New Strategy:** Focus on trading my abundant low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for high-value resources (Brick, Ore, Sheep). Since Player 1 rejected 1 Brick for 1 Ore, perhaps they want more Brick for their Ore, or simply don't want to trade Ore at all. I have a lot of Wood, and Wheat. I could try to offload a large quantity of Wood or Wheat for something more valuable. Or, if they really value Ore, I might need to offer more than 1 Brick for it. I have ample Wood and Wheat.\n\nOffer: [Offer: 20 Wood -> 4 Ore]",

The goal is to increase the total value of my holdings \u2014 so I should aim to acquire higher-value resources (especially Ore and Brick) or trade away low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for more valuable ones.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost and Scarcity**: I currently have 8 Ore \u2014 the highest-value resource \u2014 and only 8 Sheep and 15 Wheat. Giving up Ore should be done sparingly and only for significant gains, especially since it's both high-value and low in quantity. Conversely, I have 24 Wood, which is relatively abundant and lower in value \u2014 Wood can be used strategically in trades to gain more valuable resources.\n\n3. **Favor Asymmetric Valuations**: In negotiation, parties often value resources differently. Player 0 is persistently requesting Ore and Brick while offering Wood. This suggests Player 0 highly values Ore/Brick and may be willing to overpay in Wood. I can exploit this by demanding more favorable exchange rates.\n\n4. **Trade Efficiency and Marginal Gains**: Previous offers from Player 0 have undervalued Ore \u2014 for example, offering 1 Brick for 1 Ore is a terrible deal for me, since both have similar base value but I have less Ore (more scarce in my inventory). Similarly, 20 Wood for 4 Ore implies a rate of 5 Wood per Ore \u2014 while Wood is useful, I should seek better terms, especially since I have surplus Wood.\n\n5. **Strategic Timing and Leverage**: Since Player 0 is making repeated offers for Ore, they likely need it urgently. I can wait for more favorable offers or make a counteroffer that leverages their need while improving my position.\n\n6. **Counteroffer Strategy**: Instead of accepting or rejecting passively, I should proactively offer trades that increase my total value. For instance, trading excess Wood for Ore or Brick at favorable rates. Since 20 Wood was offered for only 4 Ore, I could counter with a deal that gives less Ore but requests even more Wood or includes other high-value resources.\n\nGiven this, I should make a targeted offer that exchanges some of my lower-value surplus (Wood) for high-value resources, or extract maximum value when giving up scarce high-value ones.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 3 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n- The goal is to increase the total value of your resource portfolio. Therefore, any trade should ideally result in a net gain in total value, or strategically position you for future gains.  \n- Resources have fixed values: Ore (37) > Brick (29) > Sheep (15) > Wood (10) > Wheat (6). Thus, acquiring higher-value resources (especially Ore and Brick) is more beneficial.  \n- Ore is the most valuable resource (37), so trading away Ore should only be done if receiving significantly more value in return.  \n- Wood is relatively low-value (10), so trading Wood for higher-value resources (especially Ore or Brick) can be profitable, especially in quantity.  \n- Evaluate trade ratios:  \n   - Current offer to me: 20 Wood \u2192 4 Ore = 20\u00d710 = 200 cost, 4\u00d737 = 148 value received \u2192 **Net loss of 52** \u2192 Unfavorable.  \n   - My offer: 10 Wood \u2192 3 Ore = 10\u00d710 = 100 cost, 3\u00d737 = 111 value \u2192 **Net gain of 11** \u2192 Favorable.  \n- However, my current Ore quantity is 8 \u2014 giving up 3 in trade is feasible if I receive fair or better value.  \n- My Wood stock is high (24), so trading away 10 Wood is acceptable if I gain higher-value resources.  \n- Player 0 appears eager to obtain Ore, possibly indicating a shortage or high need\u2014this can be exploited in negotiation.  \n- Since previous offers were rejected, consider adjusting offer terms to be more attractive to counterparty while still maintaining positive value.  \n- Alternatives: I could offer a mix of low-value resources (e.g., Wood + Wheat) to obtain high-value ones, or request slightly fewer Ore in exchange for a small additional incentive.  \n- Principle of reciprocity: After rejecting several offers, making a reasonable but favorable offer may restart cooperation.  \n- Consider making an offer with a small surplus value to the other player to incentivize acceptance, while still netting a gain or neutral value for me, especially to offload excess low-value resources.\n\nApply Knowledge:  \n- My previous offer (10 Wood \u2192 3 Ore) had positive value for me and slight value loss for Player 0 (100 spent, 111 lost). Player 0 may perceive this as unfavorable for them.  \n- To increase chance of acceptance, I can adjust the offer to give Player 0 a slight edge or make it more balanced, while still maintaining strategic benefit.  \n- Alternatively, I can seek trades involving Brick or Sheep if better value, but Player 0 has not shown interest yet.  \n- Since Player 0 keeps requesting Ore, they likely need it. I can leverage that, but must provide enough incentive.\n\nRevised Strategy:  \nOffer a better ratio for Player 0 to accept, using excess Wood, to acquire high-value Ore.  \nExample: 7 Wood \u2192 2 Ore  \n- Value given: 7\u00d710 = 70  \n- Value received: 2\u00d737 = 74  \n- Net gain: +4 for me, -4 for them \u2014 nearly balanced, slightly favorable to me.  \nBut this is marginal.\n\nAlternatively: 8 Wood \u2192 2 Ore  \n- 80 cost, 74 received \u2192 net loss of 6 \u2014 not acceptable.\n\nBetter: 6 Wood \u2192 2 Ore (as Player 0 previously offered, but I rejected because 60 vs 74 \u2192 net gain 14 for me). Wait \u2014 their offer was: 6 Wood \u2192 2 Ore  \nThat would be excellent for me: give 60 value, get 74 \u2192 +14. I should have accepted it.\n\nBut I rejected it. Now they are not repeating it.\n\nSo now I should offer something close to that ratio, but not as generous.\n\nRe-offer something similar to restart negotiation.\n\nBut better to make an active proposal.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Offer: 7 Wood -> 2 Ore]  \n- 70 out, 74 in \u2192 +4 gain. Small gain, but secures high-value Ore and may be acceptable to Player 0 who wants Wood.\n\nAlternatively, sweeten it for them slightly to ensure acceptance? But goal is to increase my value.\n\nBut if the trade goes through, +4 is a gain.\n\nGiven that my Wood is 24 (plenty), and Ore is high value, securing 2 Ore is good.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wood -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Understand Your Current Value:** Calculate the total value of your resources. This is your baseline.\n    *   Wheat: 15 * 6 = 90\n    *   Wood: 22 * 10 = 220\n    *   Sheep: 5 * 16 = 80\n    *   Brick: 14 * 30 = 420\n    *   Ore: 8 * 37 = 296\n    *   Total Value = 90 + 220 + 80 + 420 + 296 = 1106\n\n2.  **Identify High-Value Resources (Relative to Others):** Ore (37) and Brick (30) are your highest value resources. Wood (10) and Wheat (6) are your lowest. Sheep (16) is in the middle.\n\n3.  **Identify Low-Value Resources (Relative to Others):** Wood (10) and Wheat (6) are comparatively low-value. These are good candidates to trade *away* if you can acquire higher-value resources.\n\n4.  **Goal:** Increase total resource value. This means any proposed trade must result in you receiving more value than you give up.\n\n5.  **Principle of Scarcity/Abundance:** You have a lot of Wood (22) and Brick (14), a good amount of Wheat (15), some Ore (8), and very little Sheep (5). Resources you have in abundance (Wood, Wheat) are better to offer. Resources you have less of, especially high-value ones (Ore), are good to acquire.\n\n6.  **Calculate Trade Ratios (Your Perspective):** For any potential trade, calculate the value given up versus the value gained.\n    *   Example: trade 1 Wood (10) for 1 Ore (37). Value gained: 37. Value given: 10. Net gain: 27. This is a good trade.\n    *   Example: trade 3 Wood (30) for 1 Brick (30). Value gained: 30. Value given: 30. Net gain: 0. This trade maintains value, but doesn't increase it.\n    *   Consider Player 1's previous offers:\n        *   P1 offered 10 Wood (100) for 3 Ore (111). P1 gains 111-100 = 11. You would lose 11 value. GOOD REASON TO REJECT.\n        *   P1 offered 7 Wood (70) for 2 Ore (74). P1 gains 74-70 = 4. You would lose 4 value. GOOD REASON TO REJECT.\n\n7.  **Be Patient but Persistent:** The game has 10 turns. You don't need to make a bad trade early. Continuously propose offers that benefit you, and reject those that don't.\n\n8.  **Leverage Your Abundance:** You have a lot of wood. Use it to try and get more valuable resources like Ore or Brick.\n\n9.  **Incrementally Improve Offers:** If offers are rejected, adjust them slightly to be more appealing to the other player *while still retaining a net gain for yourself*.\n\n10. **Analyze Opponent's Offers:** Player 1 seems to be consistently trying to acquire Ore by offering Wood. This indicates Ore might be valuable to them, and they might have an abundance of Wood. This strengthens your position for trading away Wood for Ore.\n\nCurrent Situation Analysis:\nPlayer 1 has consistently tried to get Ore from you. This is a good sign, as Ore is your highest value resource, and if they value it highly, you can ask for a good price for it, or use your lower value resources to acquire it.\nPlayer 1's last offer: 7 Wood (Value 70) for 2 Ore (Value 74). This means you would lose 4 value. Reject.\n\nDecision:\nPlayer 1 wants Ore. I want to trade my abundant low-value Wood for high-value Ore or Brick. I have continually offered Wood for Ore/Brick, and P1 has been trying to get Ore from me with Wood. This is a clear indicator that they value Ore and have Wood. I need to make an offer that benefits me, by offering a significant amount of Wood for a smaller amount of Ore, or a reasonable amount of Wood for Brick. Considering the previous rejections, and that P1 is still attempting to acquire Ore, I should continue offering my abundant Wood for their desired Ore, but at a more favorable ratio for me. They offered 7 Wood for 2 Ore. My initial offers of 6 Wood for 2 Ore and 20 Wood for 4 Ore were too aggressive. Let's try to offer a slightly higher amount of wood for 2 Ore, something that still yields a net gain for me.\n\nMy goal: Acquire Ore or Brick.\nMy abundant low-value resource: Wood (Value 10)\nMy high-value desired resources: Ore (Value 37), Brick (Value 30)\n\nP1 wants Ore. What if I offer a large quantity of Wood for a small quantity of Ore?\nLet's reconsider the ratio: 7 Wood (70) for 2 Ore (74). This is still a loss for me.\nI need a net gain.\nIf I offer 7 Wood (70) and request 3 Ore (111), I gain 41. (Probably too much for P1).\nIf I offer 10 Wood (100) and request 3 Ore (111), I gain 11. This is the previous offer by P1, but they were offering Wood for Ore. Let's flip it.\n\nThey want 2 Ore. I have 8 Ore.\nIf I offer Wood for Ore:\nOffer 10 Wood (100) for 3 Ore (111). I gain 11 value.\nOffer 11 Wood (110) for 3 Ore (111). I gain 1 value. This is a very slight gain for me. P1 might accept this or offer slightly less.\nWhat about Brick? I have 14 Brick.\nIf I offer Wood for Brick:\nOffer 3 Wood (30) for 1 Brick (30). No gain.\nOffer 4 Wood (40) for 1 Brick (30). I lose 10.\nOffer 2 Wood (20) for 1 Brick (30). I gain 10. This is good for me.\n\nGiven P1's consistent offers for Ore, it is likely they value it. Let's try to convert some of my plentiful Wood into Ore. I need to ensure a net positive value trade for myself.\nP1 offered 7 Wood for 2 Ore (my value loss).\nI will offer 10 Wood for 3 Ore. This is a gain of 11 for me (111 - 100). It's a significant gain, but maybe P1 will take it given their demonstrated need for Ore.\n\n```\n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 3 Ore]\n```",
