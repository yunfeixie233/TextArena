      "response": "Knowledge-generation phase: principles and insights for this round\n\n1. Valuation awareness  \n   - Brick (29 value each) is your scarcest but most valuable resource (21 units).  \n   - Ore (35 value each) has the highest unit value, but you already have only 9 units, so you should be reluctant to give any away.  \n   - Sheeps (12 value each) are plentiful (23 units) but low in unit value\u2014good candidates for off-loading.  \n   - Wheat (6 value each) and Wood (8 value each) sit in the middle but are both relatively abundant.\n\n2. Trade-offs to increase total portfolio value  \n   - Any trade that lets you swap low value-per-unit resources (Sheep, Wheat, Wood) for high value-per-unit resources (Brick, Ore) is immediately profitable.  \n   - Do not trade away Brick or Ore unless the deal gives you back multiples of higher-value units or fills a critical need.  \n   - Volume: you have enough Sheep & Wood that trading a handful will not meaningfully reduce future flexibility but can yield big value gains.\n\n3. Negotiation psychology  \n   - Start with modest offers so they look win-win. Over-large offers are easy to reject.  \n   - Offer bundles where you send away your least-valued units and request the opponent\u2019s high-value ones.  \n   - Keep your own Ore untouched unless the deal is extremely lopsided in your favor.\n\nTrading decision (turn 1)\n\nI send an opening bid that moves 5 Sheep (low-value) and 1 Wheat (low-value) and asks for 1 Brick (highest value) and 1 Ore (second-highest). Net value gain for me: (-5*12 \u20136) + (29 + 35) = -66 + 64 = \u20112, i.e. it actually decreases my value by 2. I should not send that. Instead, I need to be more aggressive in what I demand.\n\nRecalculating: if I send away 5 low-value resources, I need more than 5\u00d712 = 60 value back. Let me offer 5 Sheep for 2 Brick and 1 Ore. Value: -5\u00d712 + 2\u00d729 + 1\u00d735 = -60 + 58 + 35 = +33. That is a huge win for me and gives the opponent 5 Sheep which he may value higher. I also leave my own Ore untouched.\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \nIn resource trading games, the core principle is to increase the total value of one's holdings by exploiting relative scarcity, perceived value differences between players, and strategic resource synergy. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Resource Valuation**: You must assess the value of your current resources not just in absolute terms, but also in terms of scarcity, utility for future development, and opportunity cost. In this context, each resource has an implied unit value:\n   - Wheat: 6\n   - Wood: 9\n   - Sheep: 12\n   - Brick: 30\n   - Ore: 37\n\n   Therefore:\n   - Sheep unit value = 12\n   - Brick unit value = 30\n   - Ore unit value = 37\n\n2. **Evaluating the Offer**:\n   - Player 0 offers: 5 Sheep (5 \u00d7 12 = 60)\n   - Requests: 2 Brick (2 \u00d7 30 = 60) and 1 Ore (1 \u00d7 37 = 37)\n   - Total requested value = 60 + 37 = 97\n\n   This means you are being asked to give up 97 units of value to receive 60 units in return \u2014 a net loss of 37.\n\n3. **Asymmetric Value Principle**: While players may value resources differently (e.g., based on development stage), offers should still maintain rough equity unless a strategic advantage (e.g., completing a set) justifies a trade deficit. You currently have ample Brick (22) and Ore (15), but giving up high-value Ore for lower or equal value returns is disadvantageous.\n\n4. **Opportunity Cost**: Ore is your most valuable resource. Unless you are bottlenecked by Sheep (which you aren\u2019t \u2014 you have 16), trading high-value resources for lower ones reduces flexibility.\n\n5. **Strategic Position**: You already have strong reserves of Brick and Sheep. Acquiring more Sheep increases surplus without clear benefit. The trade does not improve resource balance or value.\n\nConclusion: This is a poor offer for Player 1. Accepting it decreases total value and gives away high-value Ore for lower-value returns.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge  \n\n1. **Resource Valuation (Marginal Utility)**\n   - *Brick* and *Ore* are my two highest-value resources (29 and 35 respectively) and the most scarce (Brick: 21, Ore: 9).  \n   - *Sheep* (Qty 23, Value 12) is abundant relative to my lower valuation. Dumping Sheep first is logically sound.  \n   - Avoid trading *Ore* unless the return is high (brick-heavy trades or bulk discounts on Ore), as it increases in value with scarcity (I can\u2019t easily replace Ore later).\n\n2. **Marginal Utility vs. Quantity Curve**\n   - The marginal value of Sheep decreases with each extra Sheep I hold; Sheep is currently my \u201cbloat\u201d resource.  \n   - The marginal value of *Brick* and *Ore* stays high because I have few of them relative to other players likely needing them for expansion (Catan logic: building cities & roads).\n\n3. **Negotiation Framing**\n   - **First-mover disadvantage**: I keep pitching offers and Player 1 keeps rejecting. This cycles the game; if Player 1 never counters, we \u201cstall\u201d until I improve my offers.\n   - **Counter-offers**: I should force Player 1 to propose a counter-offer. Silence from Player 1 suggests they want *even better* (or they're trolling).\n   - **ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement)** estimation: My prior offers (3 Sheep \u2192 4 Brick, 5 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick+1 Ore) were rejected. So Player 1 probably demands **more Sheep per Brick, or more per Ore**, or wants cheap Wood.\n\n4. **Trade-off Strategies**\n   - **\u201cBundle and Discount\u201d**: Package Sheep with an irrelevant but popular resource (like Wood) to sweeten, rather than bleeding Sheep solo at bad rates.\n   - **\u201cGTFO\u201d principle**: If I am trading Sheep for Brick or Ore, I need to gain at least 2:1 in value; I cannot afford to make facilitator trades that don\u2019t measurably close my value gap.\n\n5. **Risk vs. Time**\n   - Game runs 10 turns total; I\u2019ve used 4 turns, only 6 left.  \n   - Time costs me if I keep lowballing; stalling wastes future turns where I could profit from ore-trades with another player.  \n\n---\n\n### Trading Decision\n\n1. **Update Offer to Realign Margins of Attractiveness to P1**  \n   - **Offer: 6 Sheep + 2 Wood \u2192 4 Brick + 2 Ore**  \n   - This pairs my two abundances (Sheep/Wood) to extract two ultra-valuables for me (Brick & Ore) that are also *likely* scarce for Player 1.  \n   - Net value projection shows favorable (Sheep + Wood marginally valued lower for me vs. Brick + Ore high for me).  \n   - **[Offer: 6 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 4 Brick, 2 Ore]**\n\n2. **Escalate by One Tier & Hold for Counter-Opportunity**  \n   - If rejected again, to create urgency, on *next* turn I\u2019ll propose a 7 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick + 1 Ore minimal counter-cardinality purely to bait a response.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output: [Offer: 6 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 4 Brick, 2 Ore]",

They are best used as \u201cgive-away\u201d chips in trade.\n- My goal is NOT simplicity (e.g., \u201cget rid of excess Sheep\u201d), but Net-Value, defined as final total value minus initial total value.\n  Value I currently hold:\n      Wheat 13\u00d76  =  78\n      Wood  14\u00d78  = 112\n      Sheep 23\u00d712 = 276\n      Brick 21\u00d729 = 609\n      Ore    9\u00d735 = 315\n      -----------------------------\n      TOTAL VALUE = 1,390\n  Any trade must raise that number; if trade is rejected, each grade I accept must ultimately outrank that same exchange.\n- Repetition of rejection by Player 1 on every offer above signals:  \n   1. Player 1 likely assigns a higher personal value to Brick and/or Ore relative to mine.  \n   2. Hence offers giving up Brick/Ore will never fly; I need a reverse flow (get Brick/Ore **for** lightweight Sheep/Wood).\n- Marginal Value Rule: an extra unit of Brick is worth **at most** 29 to me because I already have many; an extra Ore is always worth 35. Hence anything I accept should **take** either Brick or Ore, and **give** Sheep/Wood/Wheat.  \n- Quantitative Smell-Test: the last three acceptable exchanges I proposed were:\n     \u2013 6 Sheep + 2 Wood for 4 Brick + 2 Ore\n  Trade value: 6\u00d712 + 2\u00d78 = 88 (out) vs 4\u00d729 + 2\u00d735 = 186 (in)  \n  Net gain = +98 \u2013 clearly generous \u2013 and it was still turned down.\n  Therefore Player 1\u2019s Brick/Ore price is extremely high.\n\nDecision:\nI must reverse direction completely; in other words, offer to **give** high-abundant low-value resources and demand only things that yield positive marginal value.\n\nSpecifically, demand Ore because it maximizes gain per unit (35), and because I have few. I can spare a handful of Sheep/Wood without hurting total.\n\nNew action:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Resource Valuation and Opportunity Cost**:  \n   Each resource has a base value, but trading value depends on relative scarcity and demand. I should calculate the value of what I give up (opportunity cost) versus what I gain.  \n   - My current holdings:  \n     - Wheat: 8 \u00d7 6 = 48  \n     - Wood: 8 \u00d7 9 = 72  \n     - Sheep: 16 \u00d7 12 = 192  \n     - Brick: 22 \u00d7 30 = 660  \n     - Ore: 15 \u00d7 37 = 555  \n   - Total value: 48 + 72 + 192 + 660 + 555 = **1,527**  \n\n   Brick and Ore are high-value resources for me. Sheep are relatively lower-value per unit compared to Ore. Wood and Wheat are mid-tier.\n\n2. **Principle of Mutually Beneficial Trade**:  \n   A successful trade must appear beneficial to both parties. Player 0 is consistently offering Sheep and Wood to request Brick and Ore \u2014 indicating Player 0 likely lacks Brick/Ore or values them more.  \n   This suggests Brick/Ore are in higher demand. Hence, I can leverage my surplus (Brick: 22, Ore: 15) as bargaining power.\n\n3. **Trading Down in Value Is Dangerous**:  \n   Player 0\u2019s offers have been increasingly generous in Sheep but still ask for high-value returns. The latest offer:  \n   - Offer: 3 Sheep (3\u00d712 = 36), 2 Wood (2\u00d79 = 18) \u2192 Total offered: 54  \n   - Request: 2 Ore (2\u00d737 = 74)  \n   - Net value flow: -20 for me \u2192 bad trade.\n\n   Even though I have surplus, giving away 74 value for 54 is a net loss. Hence rejection was correct.\n\n4. **Initiating Counter-Offer Strategy**:  \n   Since I\u2019ve only rejected so far, I must start proposing trades to grow my value. Passive play limits growth.  \n   I should use surplus Brick or Sheep to obtain higher-value resources (Ore is most valuable; but I have 15, so moderate surplus).  \n   However, I may want to *acquire* Wood or Wheat if undervalued in trade, but I already have moderate amounts.\n\n5. **Market Signaling**:  \n   Consistently rejecting offers signals that I value Brick and Ore highly \u2014 which could lead Player 0 to improve offers. But after 5 turns, no progress. I need to take initiative.\n\n6. **Surplus Utilization**:  \n   - Sheep: 16 is high \u2192 likely good trade commodity.  \n   - Brick: 22 is very high \u2014 possibly more than needed unless building-intensive strategy.  \n   - Ore: 15 is also high, but each unit is worth 37 \u2014 highest among all. I should be cautious trading Ore.\n\nBest Strategy:\n- Trade excess Brick and Sheep for higher-value returns.\n- Avoid giving away Ore unless receiving significantly more value.\n- Consider requesting Wood or Wheat if offered at discount, but they are lower value.\n- Make an offer that appears fair but tips slightly in my favor.\n\nOpportunity:\nPlayer 0 clearly wants Brick and Ore. But keeps overreaching. I can make a **fair but value-positive offer** using my surplus Brick and Sheep to gain something of medium value, but ideally obtain *Ore back* or reduce my overstock of low-margin resources.\n\nLet me construct a trade:\n- I can offer: 5 Brick (5\u00d730 = 150) and 2 Sheep (2\u00d712 = 24) \u2192 total 174  \n- Request: 3 Ore (3\u00d737 = 111)  \n  - This seems bad: giving 174, getting 111 \u2192 net loss.\n\nWait \u2014 better approach: flip their interest.\nThey want Brick and Ore. I have surplus Brick. I should **sell Brick (and maybe Sheep) at premium**.\n\nIdeal: Get 2 Ore for less than 74 value given.\n\nBut their last offer: 3 Sheep + 2 Wood \u2192 2 Ore  \nValue: they give 36 + 18 = 54, want 74 \u2192 unfair to me.\n\nI should **offer something they want, but demand fair value**.\n\nTry:  \nOffer: 4 Brick (120) + 1 Sheep (12) = 132  \nRequest: 2 Wood (18) + 2 Ore (74) = 92 \u2192 no, still bad.\n\nWait \u2014 better: flip dynamic.\n\nI should **ask for more value than I give**.\n\nBetter idea:  \nI have too much Brick. It's valued at 30, but maybe others value it higher due to scarcity.\n\nPlayer 0 keeps asking for Brick. So demand is high.\n\nSo: **I can trade Brick at a premium**.\n\nConstruct offer:\n\nOffer: 5 Brick (150)  \nRequest: 3 Sheep (36) + 2 Wood (18) + 1 Ore (37) = 91 \u2192 no, still bad.\n\nHmm \u2014 perhaps I need to accept that I may need to give more value to trigger trade, but that contradicts goal.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps I should **offer excess Sheep and Wood to get high-value Ore**?\n\nI have:\n- Sheep: 16 \u2192 surplus\n- Wood: 8 \u2192 moderate\n\nOre: 15 \u2014 already high, but 37 value, very good.\n\nBut trading low-value for high-value is smart only if possible.\n\nWait: maybe Player 0 has surplus Ore?\n\nBut no \u2014 they keep *requesting* Ore. So likely they are short.\n\nSo I should **not give Ore. I should seek to get more**.\n\nBut I already have 15.\n\nPerhaps my best play is to **reduce overstock of Brick and Sheep for medium resources**, but only if it increases value. But that's impossible unless undervalued.\n\nWait \u2014 error in logic.\n\nGoal: *increase total value*.\n\nSo I must make trades where value-in > value-out.\n\nThus: I should only accept or make offers where:\n\u03a3(value of resources received) > \u03a3(value of resources given)\n\nSo any trade must bring in more base value than it gives.\n\nTherefore:\nI should **never** give 2 Ore (74) for less than 74 in return.\n\nSimilarly, giving 5 Brick = 150 \u2192 must get >150 in return.\n\nSo far, all Player 0's offers give me less value than they request.\n\nNow, I must create a trade where:\n- I give lower-value resources (e.g., Sheep: 12 each)\n- I get higher-value resources (Ore: 37), or several of them\n\nBut Player 0 may not have surplus Ore.\n\nAlternative: I have so much Brick (22), but Brick is 30 each \u2014 very valuable. But if I can\u2019t use them, trading for more valuable Ore is good.\n\nWait \u2014 Ore is 37 > 30 \u2192 so Ore is more valuable per unit.\n\nSo trading 1 Brick (30) for 1 Ore (37) is +7 value \u2014 excellent.\n\nBut need to trade multiple.\n\nSo ideal: trade Brick for Ore, or Sheep for Ore with some extra.\n\nBut Player 0 wants Ore \u2014 so unlikely they will give Ore.\n\nIn fact, all their offers ask *for* Ore or Brick.\n\nSo probably Player 0 is short on both.\n\nTherefore, I should **not expect to get Ore** \u2014 I should instead **sell Brick and Sheep to get value**, but what?\n\nMaybe Wood or Wheat? But they are lower value.\n\nWheat: 6, Wood: 9 \u2014 even less.\n\nSo trading high-value resources for low-value ones reduces total value.\n\nDanger.\n\nSo best strategy: **hoard or trade only if positive value**.\n\nBut must make progress.\n\nAlternate Insight:  \nPerhaps I can **use Sheep as bait**.\n\nI have 16 Sheep \u2014 highest quantity. I can bundle Sheep with Brick to get Ore.\n\nBut again, no indication Player 0 has Ore to spare.\n\nWait \u2014 Player 0 offered: 6 Sheep, 2 Wood \u2192 4 Brick, 2 Ore\n\nThat means they are willing to *give* 6 Sheep (72) + 2 Wood (18) = 90 for 4 Brick (120) + 2 Ore (74) = 194 \u2014 which is insane: they are offering 90 for 194? That can't be.\n\nWait \u2014 no: the direction.\n\n\"Offered items: 6 Sheep, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 4 Brick, 2 Ore\"\n\nThat means:  \nPlayer 0 is offering 6 Sheep and 2 Wood  \nAnd wants 4 Brick and 2 Ore from me.\n\nSo they give 90, want 120 + 74 = 194 \u2192 clearly overreaching.\n\nBut tells me: Player 0 *wants* Brick and Ore \u2014 so they likely lack them.\n\nTherefore, **I am the one with surplus of high-value goods**.\n\nThus, I should **only trade if I gain value**.\n\nBut since others want my Brick and Ore, I should **demand premium for them**.\n\nSo I should make an offer that gives low-value items (e.g. Sheep) and requests high-value items, but unlikely.\n\nOr: offer Brick only if I get *more* than 30 value per unit in return.\n\nFor example:\n- 1 Brick (30) \u2192 must get in return >30 value\n\nSo for 1 Brick, I could accept: 1 Ore (37) \u2192 good trade.\n\nBut again, Player 0 wants Ore, so won\u2019t give.\n\nPerhaps no one has extra Ore.\n\nAnother idea: maybe trade **from surplus to meet upcoming needs**, but no game mechanics specified beyond value.\n\nSince goal is to **increase total value of my resources**, only financially positive trades should be made.\n\nBut I have so much Brick (22) \u2014 if I can reduce even 10 Brick via high-value return, good.\n\nLet me consider: can I make an offer that gives moderate value but gets high value? Unlikely.\n\nPerhaps the only way is to **sell Brick for more than face value in aggregate**.\n\nExample: offer 5 Sheep (60) \u2192 request 2 Brick (60) \u2014 neutral.\n\nBut I have 16 Sheep and 22 Brick \u2014 both high.\n\nBetter: offer 6 Sheep (72) \u2192 request 3 Brick (90) \u2192 net +18 value.\n\nYes! That is positive.\n\nSheep value 12, Brick 30.\n\nSo 2 Sheep = 24 \u2192 1 Brick = 30 \u2192 so I gain 6 value per 2 Sheep traded for 1 Brick.\n\nSo rate: 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick = +6 value.\n\nSo I should try to trade Sheep for Brick.\n\nBut I already have 22 Brick.\n\nBut if trade increases total value, it's allowed.\n\nAnd goal is to increase value, not reduce quantity.\n\nSo even with 22 Brick, if I can turn 24 value into 30, I should.\n\nSame with Wood: 9 value, so 3 Wood = 27 \u2192 near 1 Brick.\n\nBut Sheep are better for this.\n\nSo best trade possibility: **Offer Sheep, request Brick or Ore.**\n\nSince Ore is even better, prioritize Ore.\n\nSo strategy:\n- Offer: multiple Sheep \u2192 request Brick and/or Ore\n- Ensure value received > value given\n\nExample:  \nOffer: 5 Sheep (60)  \nRequest: 2 Brick (60) \u2014 neutral \u2192 acceptable but not ideal  \nBetter: Request 2 Brick + 1 Wood (60 + 9 = 69) \u2192 net +9\n\nBut they may not accept.\n\nOr: Request 1 Ore (37) \u2192 then need more Sheep offered.\n\n5 Sheep = 60 \u2192 1 Ore = 37 \u2192 I could offer 3 Sheep (36) for 1 Ore (37) \u2192 +1, but slim.\n\nBut they may not want Sheep \u2014 wait, Player 0 has been offering Sheep, so maybe they have surplus.\n\nIn their offers, they offered up to 6 Sheep \u2014 so likely they have many.\n\nSo they may not want more.\n\nSo unlikely they will trade Brick for Sheep.\n\nConversely, I should **offer Brick only for more than 30 value per unit**.\n\n1 Brick = 30 \u2192 should get >30 value back.\n\nSo for 1 Brick, acceptable returns:\n- 1 Ore (37)\n- 2 Sheep and 1 Wood: 24+9=33\n- 3 Sheep: 36\n\nBut again, they want Brick, so may not give that much.\n\nBest option: since we are at turn 5, and no trades made, I should **make a fair but value-positive offer to stimulate trade**.\n\nLet me propose:\n\nOffer: 4 Sheep (48) + 1 Wood (9) = 57  \nRequest: 2 Brick (60) \u2192 net +3 value\n\nSlightly positive.\n\nBut I want to use my greatest surplus: 16 Sheep.\n\nAlternative:\nOffer: 6 Sheep (72)  \nRequest: 2 Ore (74) \u2192 net +2 value\n\nVery good \u2014 minimal gain, but positive.\n\nDo I make it?\n\nBut Player 0 has been wanting Ore, so unlikely.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps I can exploit their desire for Brick.\n\nThey want Brick \u2014 I have lots.\n\nSo I can **sell Brick at a premium**.\n\nBut to sell, I need to receive more than 30 value per Brick.\n\nIs there demand?\n\nFrom their offers, they are willing to give up to 6 Sheep and 2 Wood (90) for 4 Brick and 2 Ore \u2014 but that's not helpful.\n\nFrom that, they value 4 Brick at much more than 90, since they offered 90 for both 4 Brick and 2 Ore.\n\nSo perhaps 4 Brick are worth at least 100 to them.\n\nSo they may be willing to give, say, 3 Sheep (36) for 1 Brick (30) \u2014 which is +6 for me if I trade Brick for Sheep? No \u2014 I would get 36 for giving 30 \u2014 +6.\n\nBut I have high Sheep already.\n\nBetter to get Ore.\n\nLet\u2019s try to construct a value-positive offer for me.\n\nBest opportunity:  \nI have low-value resource to give, high-value to receive.\n\nLow-value: Sheep (12) \u2014 but I have 16  \nHigh-value to get: Ore (37) or Brick (30) \u2014 but I have lots of Brick.\n\nBut since Brick is 30 > 12, trading Sheep for Brick is value-positive.\n\nSo I should do that, even though I have many Brick, because value increases.\n\nTotal value is the metric, not inventory balance.\n\nSo: trade Sheep for Brick or Ore.\n\nOre better.\n\nProposal:\n\n[Offer: 6 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood]\n\nValue given: 6*12 = 72  \nValue received: 3*30 + 1*9 = 90 + 9 = 99  \nNet: +27 \u2192 very good.\n\nDo I have 6 Sheep? Yes, 16.\n\nIs this fair? I'm offering 72 for 99 \u2014 they might reject, but it's highly favorable for me.\n\nOr make it fairer to increase chance of acceptance.\n\n[Offer: 8 Sheep -> 4 Brick, 2 Wood]\n\nValue out: 96\nValue in: 120 + 18 = 138\nNet +42 \u2014 even better for me, but less likely to accept.\n\nOr make it seem more balanced:\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 3 Brick]\n\nValue out: 60\nValue in: 90\nNet +30 \u2014 excellent.\n\nThis is a great trade for me: 5 Sheep (60) for 3 Brick (90)\n\nI have 16 Sheep, can spare 5.\nI have 22 Brick \u2014 wait, no: I am *receiving* Brick.\n\nIn this offer, I am **receiving** 3 Brick, **giving** 5 Sheep.\n\nYes.\n\nSo after trade:\n- Sheep: 16 - 5 = 11\n- Brick: 22 + 3 = 25\n- Value change: +30\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd it aligns with my surplus: reduce Sheep, increase higher-value Brick.\n\nEven though Brick is not as valuable as Ore, it's still higher return.\n\nIs there a way to get Ore?\n\nSuppose I want to target Ore.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nOut: 36 + 18 = 54\nIn: 37 \u2192 net -17 \u2192 bad.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nOut: 24, in: 37 \u2192 +13 \u2192 good.\n\nBut they may have surplus Ore? Unlikely.\n\nBut let's compare.\n\nTrading 2 Sheep for 1 Ore is +13 value.\nTrading 5 Sheep for 3 Brick is +30 total, or +6 per \"value unit\".\n\nBetter than +13.\n\n5 Sheep to 3 Brick is very efficient.\n\nMoreover, Player 0 wants Brick \u2014 but in their offers, they are offering to pay *with* Sheep to get Brick.\n\nBut in this trade, I am *receiving* Brick.\n\nContradiction.\n\nIf Player 0 wants Brick, why would they trade Brick *to* me?\n\nThey wouldn't.\n\nSo my offer of Sheep for Brick is opposite to their interest.\n\nThey want to *get* Brick, not give.\n\nSo they will not accept an offer where they give me Brick.\n\nAll their offers are them giving Sheep/Wood to get Brick from me.\n\nSo they are short on Brick.\n\nTherefore, they will not trade Brick to me.\n\nSo my offer is pointless.\n\nMust reverse.\n\nI should **sell Brick** \u2014 that is, offer Brick in exchange for other resources \u2014 but only if I get more value.\n\nSo: Offer Brick (30), but only if receive >30 value.\n\nFor example:\nOffer: 1 Brick (30)  \nRequest: 1 Ore (37) \u2192 net +7\n\nOr Request: 3 Sheep (36) \u2192 net +6\n\nOr Request: 2 Sheep + 1 Wood (24+9=33) \u2192 +3\n\nAll good.\n\nBut do they want Brick? Yes \u2014 based on all offers.\n\nSo I can sell it.\n\nLet\u2019s make an offer:\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 4 Sheep]\n\nValue out: 90\nValue in: 48 \u2192 net -42 \u2192 no, bad.\n\nI would be giving 90 for 48.\n\nNo.\n\nI need to receive more value.\n\nSo: [Offer: 2 Brick -> 3 Sheep, 1 Wood]\n\nOut: 60\nIn: 36 + 9 = 45 \u2192 still bad.\n\nNo.\n\nTo break even: for 1 Brick (30), receive at least 30 value.\n\nSo 3 Sheep (36) is acceptable.\n\nBut 3 Sheep = 36 > 30.\n\nSo: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep]\n\nOut: 30, in: 36 \u2192 +6\n\nYes.\n\nOr for Ore: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore] = +7\n\nBetter.\n\nBut they want Ore too.\n\nOr [Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep] = 74 + 12 = 86 in, 60 out \u2192 +26\n\nVery good.\n\nBut again, they may not have Ore.\n\nGiven they have been willing to give up to 6 Sheep for Brick, they likely have Sheep surplus.\n\nSo they might be willing to give 3 Sheep for 1 Brick.\n\nSo the trade [1 Brick for 3 Sheep] is viable: +6 for me.\n\nLet\u2019s do it.\n\nBut 1 Brick for 3 Sheep: is it worth it?\n\nYes, increases value.\n\nAnd I have 22 Brick \u2014 can spare 1.\n\nScale up.\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 9 Sheep]\n\nOut: 90\nIn: 108\nNet +18\n\nGood.\n\nBut I have 16 Sheep \u2014 do I want more?\n\nBut value increases, so yes.\n\nAlternatively, trade for a mix.\n\nBut let's make a realistic offer based on their trading pattern.\n\nThey offered 3 Sheep for 4 Brick before \u2014 very bad.\n\nBut shows they value Brick highly.\n\nSo they might accept a premium.\n\nBest offer:\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 7 Sheep]\n\nLet's calculate:\nOut: 2*30 = 60\nIn: 7*12 = 84\nNet +24\n\nGood.\n\nBut do I want 7 more Sheep? I have 16.\n\n16+7=23 \u2014 very high, but allowed.\n\nValue increases.\n\nOr to avoid too many Sheep, add Wood.\n\nBut Wood is only 9.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 5 Sheep, 2 Wood]\n\nOut: 60\nIn: 60 + 18 = 78\nNet +18\n\nStill good.\n\nBut 5 Sheep and 2 Wood from them.\n\nBased on their offers, they have multiple Wood and Sheep.\n\nSo likely possible.\n\nBut the simplest is to go for value.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 2 Ore]\n\nOut: 60\nIn: 74\nNet +14\n\nExcellent.\n\nBut will they accept if they want Ore?\n\nUnlikely.\n\nSo safest: trade for their surplus \u2014 Sheep.\n\nSo [Offer: 2 Brick -> 6 Sheep]\n\nOut: 60\nIn: 72\nNet +12\n\nGood.\n\nOr +13 units of Sheep.\n\nBut let's make it:\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep, 1 Wood]\n\nOut: 30\nIn: 36 + 9 = 45\nNet +15\n\nVery good.\n\n1 Brick for 3 Sheep and 1 Wood.\n\nI have plenty of Brick.\n\nThey have offered multiple Sheep and Wood, so likely have.\n\nThis trade increases my value by 15.\n\nBest available given market conditions.\n\nSo I will make this offer.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep, 1 Wood]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. Value Density & Surplus:  \n   - Brick (29) and Ore (35) are the highest-value resources.  \n   - Sheep (12) and Wood (8) are the lowest.  \n   - I have a large surplus of Sheep (23) and Wood (14) compared with Brick (21) and Ore (9).  \n   - Trading low-value surplus for high-value scarce resources maximizes total value.\n\n2. Marginal Utility & Diminishing Returns:  \n   - The 23rd Sheep is worth far less to me than the 10th Ore or 22nd Brick.  \n   - Player 1\u2019s offer of 6 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick + 1 Wood gives me:  \n     \u2013 Lose 6 Sheep (6 \u00d7 12 = 72 value)  \n     \u2013 Gain 3 Brick (3 \u00d7 29 = 87) + 1 Wood (1 \u00d7 8 = 8) = 95 value  \n     \u2013 Net gain = 95 \u2013 72 = +23 value.\n\n3. Negotiation Leverage:  \n   - Player 1 has repeatedly rejected my offers, indicating they value Brick/Ore highly.  \n   - Their current offer is the first time they propose a trade; accepting builds goodwill and may encourage future favorable deals.\n\n4. Risk of Rejection:  \n   - If I counter-offer, they may simply withdraw, leaving me with no gain.  \n   - Accepting now locks in a clear value increase.\n\nApply Knowledge:\n\n[Accept]",
