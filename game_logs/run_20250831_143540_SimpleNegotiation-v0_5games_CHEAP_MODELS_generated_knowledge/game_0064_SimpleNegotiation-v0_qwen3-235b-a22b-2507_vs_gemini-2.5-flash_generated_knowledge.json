      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Resource Valuation and Opportunity Cost**:  \n   Each resource has a fixed value, but its utility depends on scarcity and demand. I should prioritize increasing low-quantity high-value resources or trade excess low-value resources for high-value ones.  \n   - Wheat: 6 (low value)  \n   - Wood: 10 (low value)  \n   - Sheep: 13 (medium value)  \n   - Brick: 28 (high value)  \n   - Ore: 38 (highest value)  \n\n   I currently have moderate to high quantities of all except Brick (only 8). Since Brick is high value but low quantity, acquiring more Brick could significantly increase total asset value.\n\n2. **Surplus vs. Deficit Analysis**:  \n   - Wheat: 22 (very high) \u2192 Surplus \u2192 Ideal to trade away  \n   - Wood: 15 \u2192 Moderate surplus \u2192 Can trade  \n   - Sheep: 22 \u2192 High quantity, medium value \u2192 Possible trade surplus  \n   - Brick: 8 \u2192 Deficit relative to high value \u2192 Target to acquire  \n   - Ore: 11 \u2192 Only moderate quantity, high value \u2192 Keep or trade sparingly  \n\n   Strategy: Use excess Wheat and Wood to acquire Brick or Ore.\n\n3. **Trade Efficiency & Value Advantage**:  \n   Aim for trades where the **value received > value given**, or where I acquire scarce high-value resources.  \n   - Trading Sheep (13) or Wheat (6) for Brick (28) offers high return if ratio is favorable.  \n   - Avoid trading Ore (38) unless receiving significantly more value in return.\n\n4. **Negotiation Leverage**:  \n   Because I hold large quantities of Wheat and Sheep, others may want them. I can use them as bargaining chips to request high-value returns (e.g., Brick or Ore).\n\n5. **Turn Limit Consideration (10 turns total)**:  \n   Need to act strategically early. Since offers can be denied, propose balanced but favorable offers to increase acceptance chance.\n\n6. **Market Dynamics Insight**:  \n   Players likely seek Brick and Ore. Being a source of Wheat/Sheep, I can position myself as a supplier in exchange for Brick.\n\n**Optimal Trade Strategy**:  \nPropose offers exchanging surplus Wheat or Sheep for Brick. Avoid giving up too much Ore. Try to net gain in high-value resources.\n\nApply Knowledge:  \nI will make an initial offer to trade excess Sheep (medium value, surplus) and a small amount of Ore (high value, but we have 11) to acquire more Brick (high value, low quantity). But to be cautious, I should not offer Ore yet. Instead, use Sheep and Wheat.\n\nBetter: Offer Wheat (lowest utility) and Sheep to get Brick.\n\n**Value-based offer example**:  \n- Giving: 5 Wheat (5\u00d76=30) + 3 Sheep (3\u00d713=39) \u2192 Total value given: 69  \n- Request: 3 Brick (3\u00d728=84) \u2192 Value received: 84  \n\u2192 Net gain: +15\n\nThat's favorable.\n\nBut simpler, more acceptable offer:\n- Offer: 3 Sheep (39) + 2 Wheat (12) = 51 value \u2192 Request 2 Brick (56) \u2192 slight surplus for receiver? Not good.\n\nFlip: want to receive more value.\n\nAlternatively, aim for fair or slightly generous offers to increase acceptance chance.\n\nTry: Offer 4 Wheat and 1 Sheep \u2192 request 2 Brick  \n- Given: 4\u00d76 + 1\u00d713 = 24+13=37  \n- Received: 2\u00d728=56 \u2192 Too good for me, unlikely accepted.\n\nMore balanced:  \nOffer 5 Sheep \u2192 Request 2 Brick and 1 Wheat (partial return)  \n- Given: 5\u00d713=65  \n- Received: 2\u00d728 + 6 = 62 \u2192 Almost even, slightly in my favor.\n\nBut better: use surplus Wheat.\n\n**Best approach**: Offer a mix of low-value surplus to get high-value return.\n\nFinal Offer Decision:\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick]  \n- Value given: 5\u00d76 + 2\u00d713 = 30 + 26 = 56  \n- Value received: 3\u00d728 = 84  \n- Net gain: +28 \u2014 highly favorable\n\nBut might be too generous on my side? No \u2014 wait: I gain value, but the trader gives me 84 for 56 \u2014 so they lose unless they value Brick low.\n\nWait \u2014 correction: if the other player has excess Brick, they might accept a favorable trade.\n\nBut to increase chance of acceptance, make it fair or slightly favorable to them.\n\nAdjust:  \nOffer: 3 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 3 Brick  \n- Given: 3\u00d713 + 3\u00d76 = 39+18=57  \n- Received: 84 \u2192 still too good for me.\n\nAh \u2014 mistake: Brick is high value, so giving 3 Brick costs the receiver 84 value.\n\nSo any offer giving me 3 Brick for <84 value is good for me.\n\nBut to be realistic, perhaps offer more.\n\nTry:  \n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 4 Wheat -> 2 Brick]  \n- Given: 4\u00d713 + 4\u00d76 = 52 + 24 = 76  \n- Received: 2\u00d728 = 56 \u2192 I lose value. Bad.\n\nWe want: value received > value given.\n\nSo:  \n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick]  \n- Given: 3\u00d76 + 2\u00d713 = 18 + 26 = 44  \n- Received: 56 \u2192 Net gain: +12 \u2192 Good for me.\n\nBut other player gives 56 for 44 \u2014 they might not accept.\n\nAlternatively, aim for even or slightly favorable to them to encourage deal.\n\nBut goal is to increase my total value \u2014 so must ensure gain.\n\nBetter: Target an offer that is mutually beneficial.\n\nSince I have 22 Sheep, trading 3 is feasible.\n\nUse higher surplus: Wheat.\n\nNew idea:  \n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick]  \n- Given: 36, Received: 28 \u2192 I lose. Bad.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]  \n- 26 \u2192 28 \u2192 +2 \u2014 minimal gain.\n\nBetter: Bundle.\n\nAfter analysis:\n\nBest balance of feasibility and gain:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 2 Brick]  \n- Given: 39 + 18 = 57  \n- Received: 56 \u2192 -1 \u2192 slight loss, but may be acceptable if they value Brick low.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps offer less valuable bundle for 1 Brick.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]  \n- Given: 24 + 13 = 37  \n- Received: 28 \u2192 I lose 9.\n\nNo.\n\nReverse thinking: I should **request** high-value returns only when giving lower value.\n\nOptimal:  \nGive 1 Sheep (13) for 1 Brick? No \u2014 13\u219228: +15 \u2014 but unlikely accepted.\n\nSo to make it palatable, pair with low-value item.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood]  \n- Given: 13 + 30 = 43  \n- Received: 28 + 10 = 38 \u2192 I lose.\n\nNo.\n\nBetter: Receive more than give.\n\nIdea: Offer resources others might need (Wheat, Sheep) for Brick. Many games, Brick is highly sought \u2014 maybe others won't want to give it unless receiving Ore or good deal.\n\nBut I am low on Brick \u2014 must acquire.\n\nAlternative: Use Ore sparingly.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Ore]  \n- Given: 39+12=51, Received: 76 \u2192 +25 \u2014 excellent if accepted.\n\nBut Ore is already 11 \u2014 not deficit. Brick is more urgent.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nPrioritize increasing Brick.\n\nMake a reasonable offer that gives moderate value but requests high value, hoping another player has Brick surplus.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 3 Brick]\n\n- Given: 24 + 39 = 63\n- Received: 84\n- Net: +21\n\nThis is ambitious but possible if someone has excess Brick.\n\nYes.\n\n**Trading Decision**:\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 3 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: \n*   **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This means I should always aim for trades where the value of resources received is greater than the value of resources given, or at least equal if it facilitates future, more profitable trades.\n*   **Current Inventory Analysis:**\n    *   **Wheat:** Qty: 6, Value: 5 (Low quantity, low value - good to trade away if I can gain higher value resources).\n    *   **Wood:** Qty: 19, Value: 8 (High quantity, low value - prime candidate for trading away, especially for Brick or Ore).\n    *   **Sheep:** Qty: 13, Value: 13 (Medium quantity, medium-low value - decent for trading if I get high value items).\n    *   **Brick:** Qty: 6, Value: 30 (Medium quantity, HIGH value - **Highly desirable** to gain more of, very hesitant to trade away).\n    *   **Ore:** Qty: 9, Value: 40 (Medium quantity, VERY HIGH value - **Extremely desirable** to gain more of, should never trade away unless for an astronomical profit).\n*   **Past Trades Review:**\n    *   P0 offered: 5 Wheat (25 value), 2 Sheep (26 value) -> 3 Brick (90 value). **My rejection was correct**; I would lose significant value.\n    *   I offered: 6 Wheat (30 value), 10 Wood (80 value) -> 3 Brick (90 value), 1 Ore (40 value). Total offered value: 110. Total requested value: 130. **This was a good offer for me**, as I would gain 20 value by giving away low-value, high-quantity resources for high-value resources. Player 0 rejected it, likely because it was a net loss for them or they didn't value Brick/Ore as highly from their perspective.\n*   **Negotiation Strategy:**\n    1.  **Identify Surplus/Deficit:** I have a high quantity of low-value resources (Wood) and a relatively low quantity of high-value resources (Brick, Ore). My goal is to convert low-value surplus into high-value deficit.\n    2.  **Target High-Value Resources:** My primary targets are Brick (Value 30) and Ore (Value 40).\n    3.  **Offer Low-Value Resources:** I'm willing to part with Wood, Wheat, and Sheep (in that order of preference) to acquire Brick and Ore.\n    4.  **Value Assessment:** Always calculate the total value of what I give vs. what I receive. Aim for a positive value difference. Even a neutral trade is acceptable if it helps me rebalance my inventory for future, more profitable trades.\n    5.  **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adjust offers. Since Player 0 rejected my previous good offer, they might be looking for a more balanced exchange or perhaps have different resource priorities.\n    6.  **Patience:** The game lasts 10 turns. I don't need to make the perfect trade now.\n    7.  **Consider Player 0's Perspective (Hypothetical):** Player 0 tried to get Brick from me earlier. This suggests Brick is valuable to them. My previous offer included Brick as a *request*, which might be why they rejected it. If they want Brick, I should try to get something even more valuable in return, or offer something else they need.\n    8.  **Look for win-win, but prioritize my win:** Try to craft offers that seem appealing to the other player but still result in a net gain for me.\n*   **Next Steps:** Since Player 0 didn't make an offer, I need to initiate. I should revise my previous offer slightly to make it more appealing to Player 0 while still remaining profitable for me.\n\nMy previous offer was: 6 Wheat (30), 10 Wood (80) -> 3 Brick (90), 1 Ore (40). (110 vs 130) -> +20 for me.\nPlayer 0 rejected this. Maybe they didn't want to give up 1 Ore, or perhaps found the 3 Brick too much.\n\nLet's try an offer that focuses on trading my abundant low-value resources for *one* of Player 0's desired high-value resources, or a combination that is slightly less demanding on Player 0 while still good for me.\n\nConsider giving up more Wood and potentially some Sheep for Brick or Ore.\n\nOption A: Focus on just one desired resource for me.\nIf P0 wants Brick, I can offer a lot of my low-value resources for it.\ne.g., Offer: 12 Wood (96), 5 Wheat (25) -> 3 Brick (90). Total offered: 121. Total requested: 90. This is a loss for me. Not good.\n\nI need to reverse their earlier offer (5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick) but make it profitable for me. They wanted 3 Brick FROM ME. So they value Brick.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of my low value resources for a smaller quantity of their high value resources (Brick/Ore)?\n\nHow about: I give up a lot of Wood and some Sheep, to gain some Brick and potentially some Ore.\n\nLet's re-evaluate my priorities: Gain Brick and Ore. Trade away Wood, Wheat, Sheep.\n\nWhat if I offer a large amount of my Wood and Sheep for just some Brick?\nExample: [Offer: 10 Wood (80), 5 Sheep (65) -> 3 Brick (90)]. Total given: 145. Total received: 90. Still a loss for me.\n\nThis suggests Player 0 wants a very good deal for their Brick/Ore.\nI need to make an offer that looks appealing to them (e.g., giving them high quantity, useful resources for them), but still results in a net gain for me.\n\nSince they rejected my previous offer, maybe I need to ask for less or offer more \"attractive\" resources.\n\nLet's try to get Ore, as it's the highest value.\n[Offer: 10 Wood, 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]\nOffered: 10 Wood (80) + 5 Sheep (65) = 145 value\nRequested: 1 Ore (40) + 1 Brick (30) = 70 value. Still a huge loss.\n\nOkay, I need to think about what Player 0 might *need*. My abundant Wood might be useful to them. My plentiful Sheep could be too.\n\nLet's stick to the principle of converting low-value volume into high-value scarcity.\nMy last offer (6 Wheat, 10 Wood for 3 Brick, 1 Ore) was actually very good for me (+20 value). Player 0 rejecting it implies they either didn't see the value for themselves, or they had other priorities.\n\nOption for next turn:\nTry to get 1 Ore. What would I give up for 1 Ore (40 value)?\nI have 19 Wood (8 value each).\nIf I give 4 Wood (32 value) for 1 Ore (40 value) = +8 net. That seems like a fair starting point for negotiations.\nIf I give 5 Wood (40 value) for 1 Ore (40 value) = 0 net. This is acceptable for converting low-value stock to high-value stock.\n\nLet's try to aim for a small positive gain on Ore.\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore] (32 value given, 40 value received. +8 value gain for me). This is simple and clear. Player 0 might want more in quantity.\n\nWhat if I offer a package of varied low-value resources?\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]\nOffered: 5 Wood (40) + 3 Sheep (39) = 79 value\nRequested: 1 Ore (40) + 1 Brick (30) = 70 value. Still a loss for me.\n\nThe value of Brick and Ore is very high, which makes it hard to trade my low-value resources without giving away a lot.\n\nWhat about a symmetrical trade, but I get the high-value item?\nExample: 10 Wood (80) for 2 Brick (60) and 1 Wheat (5). Still a loss.\n\nMy best strategy is to continue pushing for trades where I convert a high quantity of my low value goods (Wood, Sheep, Wheat) into a low quantity of high value goods (Brick, Ore). My previous rejected offer was exactly this and profitable for me.\n\nPerhaps Player 0 values Wood highly and therefore wants a lot for their Brick/Ore. Or they just have a high asking price.\n\nLet's consider a smaller, simpler trade to test the waters with Player 0 regarding Ore specifically.\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nOffered: 5 Wood (40) + 1 Wheat (5) = 45 value\nRequested: 1 Ore (40) = 40 value.\nThis is a -5 value trade for me. I should avoid this.\n\nI need to get *at least* equal value back. Ideally, more.\n\nGiven Player 0 rejected my previous offer where I offered 6 Wheat (30), 10 Wood (80) [Total 110] for 3 Brick (90), 1 Ore (40) [Total 130] (+20 for me). They probably want a better deal for themselves.\n\nLet's try to target Brick directly, as they initially wanted it from me.\nMy current Brick inventory is 6 (Value 30 each). I want MORE Brick, not less.\n\n*   My goal: Increase value.\n*   My surplus low-value: Wood (19), Sheep (13), Wheat (6).\n*   My deficit high-value: Brick (6), Ore (9).\n\nWhat if I offer a lot of Wood and Sheep for just ONE Brick?\n[Offer: 10 Wood, 5 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nOffered: 10 Wood (80) + 5 Sheep (65) = 145 value\nRequested: 1 Brick (30) = 30 value. Massive loss.\n\nThis is tougher than I thought, given P0's rejections.\nI need to make an offer that is perceived as valuable by Player 0 (lots of something they might need, like Wood or Sheep), but where I extract a higher value item.\n\nLet's go back to my initial successful strategy of trying to convert high quantity, low value into high value.\nI have 19 Wood. It's my most abundant low-value resource.\nTarget: Ore, then Brick.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wood for a smaller quantity of Ore?\n[Offer: 7 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nOffered: 7 Wood * 8 = 56 value\nRequested: 1 Ore * 40 = 40 value\nThis is a loss of 16 for me. No.\n\nI need to gain value.\nOffer: 3 Sheep (39) -> 1 Ore (40). This is a +1 value gain for me. It's a very slight gain, but it converts Sheep (medium value) to Ore (high value) and reduces my Sheep quantity. Player 0 might not accept it as it's not a huge quantity for them.\n\nLet's try to offer a mix that is substantial but still profitable for me.\n[Offer: 6 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nOffered: 6 Wood (48) + 3 Sheep (39) = 87 value\nRequested: 1 Ore (40) = 40 value. This is a -47 value trade for me. Still not good. My math earlier for these was off.\n\nI need to recalculate carefully.\nWheat: Value 5\nWood: Value 8\nSheep: Value 13\nBrick: Value 30\nOre: Value 40\n\n**My Target:** Gain Ore (40), then gain Brick (30).\n**My Offer Pool:** Wood (8), Sheep (13), Wheat (5).\n\nIf I trade 1 Ore (40 value):\n*   To gain 1 Ore, what can I give that has a value less than 40 but gives Player 0 a good quantity?\n*   Giving 3 Sheep (13*3=39) for 1 Ore (40) is +1 for me. This is a great deal!\n*   Giving 5 Wheat (5*5=25) for 1 Ore (40) is +15 for me. (But I only have 6 Wheat, so this would deplete it).\n*   Giving 4 Wood (8*4=32) for 1 Ore (40) is +8 for me.\n\nThe 3 Sheep for 1 Ore seems like the best balance between giving a reasonable quantity and ensuring a value gain for me. Player 0 might accept 3 Sheep, as Sheep is a common building resource.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore. It's the highest value.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 3 * 13 = 39\nValue requested: 1 * 40 = 40\nNet gain for me: +1. This is minimal but moves me towards high-value resources.\n\nWhat about something for Brick?\nTo gain 1 Brick (30 value):\n*   2 Sheep (26 value) for 1 Brick (30 value) = +4 for me. This is also a good profitable trade. And I have many Sheep.\n\nBetween getting +1 for Ore and +4 for Brick, Brick seems better for immediate value gain.\nHowever, Ore is the highest value commodity, so securing a source for it is strategically good.\n\nPlayer 0 previously offered 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick. This means Player 0 wanted 3 Brick *from me*. This confirms Player 0 values Brick.\nIf Player 0 wants Brick, then they might be willing to give up Ore for it, or other resources.\n\nMy previous offer was: 6 Wheat (30), 10 Wood (80) -> 3 Brick (90), 1 Ore (40). (110 offered, 130 received. +20).\nP0 rejected this. They likely felt they were giving up too much high value (Brick+Ore) for low-value goods.\n\nPerhaps I need to offer something they specifically value more than what I previously offered for their Brick/Ore. Or scale down my asks.\n\nLet's go for Ore, as it's the top value item.\nI am comfortable trading Wood, Wheat, Sheep.\n\nOffer: [Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 5 * 8 = 40\nValue requested: 1 * 40 = 40\nNet gain: 0. This changes quantity of low-value for quality of high-value. This is a reasonable trade for me. It might be appealing to P0 if they need Wood.\n\nLet's consider going for a gain rather than just even.\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore] (32 value offered, 40 value requested. +8 value for me). This is my ideal.\nBut Player 0 might reject if they see it as too good for me.\n\nWhat if I offer Wood + Wheat for Ore?\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nOffered: 3*8 (24) + 2*5 (10) = 34 value\nRequested: 1*40 = 40 value.\nNet gain: +6 for me. This feels balanced and offers Player 0 two types of low-value resources. I have enough Wood and Wheat.\n\nThis seems like a good offer. It gives me a positive value gain and offers a reasonable amount of lower-value resources that Player 0 might need.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: What key principles, strategies, or insights about resource trading and negotiation are most relevant to your current situation?\n\nKey Principles and Strategic Insights:\n\n1. **Value Asymmetry Exploitation**: Successful trades occur when each player values the requested resources differently. I should aim to trade away lower-value resources (to me) for higher-value ones. My current valuations:\n   - Ore (38) > Brick (28) > Sheep (13) > Wood (10) > Wheat (6)\n   This means I should prioritize acquiring Ore and Brick, and be willing to part with Wheat and Wood more freely.\n\n2. **Resource Surplus and Opportunity Cost**:\n   - I have high quantities of Wheat (22) and Sheep (22) \u2014 surplus resources I can use as trade leverage.\n   - Brick (8) and Ore (11) are more valuable and moderately stocked; I may want to increase Brick if possible.\n   - Wood (15) is relatively high, but its low value (10) makes it good for trading.\n   - Sheep (22) are high in quantity but mid-tier in value (13); they\u2019re useful for trade bait.\n\n3. **Trade Efficiency**: Offers should aim for positive net value gain. I should avoid trades that give away high-value units (like Ore) unless receiving significantly more in return.\n\n4. **Negotiation Dynamics**:\n   - Player 1 has repeatedly targeted Brick (requested 3 Brick in both offers). This signals high demand.\n   - Player 1 is offering Wood and Wheat\u2014low-value to me\u2014suggesting they may undervalue them.\n   - Their latest offer: 10 Wood, 5 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick. From my perspective:\n     - I lose 3 Brick \u00d7 28 = 84 value\n     - I gain: 10 Wood \u00d7 10 = 100, 5 Sheep \u00d7 13 = 65 \u2192 Total gain = 165\n     - Net value change: 165 - 84 = +81 \u2014 a highly favorable trade for me.\n   - However, Brick may be critical for my long-term strategy. But given the high surplus of Brick (8), losing 3 might be acceptable if it increases my total value.\n\n5. **Counter-Offer Strategy**:\n   - Instead of accepting outright, I can make a competitive offer that still satisfies Player 1\u2019s interest in Brick but gives me even better terms.\n\n6. **Scarcity and Timing**: Only 10 turns total. Opportunities may diminish. Rejecting favorable trades risks missed gains.\n\nConclusion: The latest offer from Player 1 is highly favorable in pure value terms. However, to gain even more control and possibly improve terms, I can make a slightly better-tailored offer that still provides Player 1 with the Brick they want but requests more high-value or scarce inputs.\n\nBest Action: Make a counter-offer that requests more high-value resources such as Ore or keeps more Brick, or request additional mid-value Sheep.\n\nRevised Offer Consideration:\n- Offer: 3 Brick \u2192 Request: 10 Wood, 5 Sheep, 1 Ore? That would be even better.\nBut Player 1 hasn\u2019t shown willingness to give Ore.\n\nAlternatively, reinforce demand using my surplus:\n- Offer: 3 Brick (value 84) \u2190 Request: 10 Wood (100) + 5 Sheep (65) = 165 \u2192 already favorable.\nSince Player 1 made this offer, they likely accept that valuation.\n\nTherefore, accepting this offer increases my total resource value significantly.\n\n[Accept]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Objective:** The primary goal is to increase the *total value* of my resources. This means evaluating trades not just by quantity, but by the value per unit and the overall change in my inventory's worth.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** I have a clear understanding of the individual value of each resource:\n    *   Wheat: 5\n    *   Wood: 8\n    *   Sheep: 13\n    *   Brick: 30\n    *   Ore: 40\n    Brick and Ore are my most valuable resources. Wheat and Wood are my least valuable. Sheep is moderately valuable.\n3.  **Opportunity Cost:** Every resource I give up is a resource I can no longer use or trade. I must ensure the value gained from a trade outweighs the value forfeited.\n4.  **Strategic Resource Accumulation:** Given the high value of Brick and Ore, acquiring more of these, especially for less valuable resources, is highly beneficial. Conversely, offloading lower-value resources for higher-value ones is a good strategy.\n5.  **Understanding Opponent's Needs (Inferred):** I previously traded 10 Wood and 5 Sheep for 3 Brick. This indicates Player 0 might have a need for Wood or Sheep, or value Brick less than I do, or is willing to give up Brick for a combination of other resources. They also rejected an offer for Brick and Ore, possibly indicating they value Ore highly or didn't want to part with that much Brick.\n6.  **Negotiation Leverage:** I have a good quantity of Wood (19) and Sheep (13), which are middle to low value for me but might be relatively more valuable to Player 0. I have a decent amount of high-value Ore (9) and Brick (6).\n7.  **Previous Trades Analysis:**\n    *   Player 0 offered: 5 Wheat (25 value), 2 Sheep (26 value) -> Requested: 3 Brick (90 value). I rejected this, as giving 90 value for 51 value is a poor trade. This reinforces that Player 0 might *want* Brick, and offers unfavorable trades for it.\n    *   I offered: 6 Wheat (30 value), 10 Wood (80 value) -> Requested: 3 Brick (90 value), 1 Ore (40 value). Total offered value: 110. Total requested value: 130. This was a good offer for me, as I would gain 20 value by giving up low-value resources for high-value resources. Player 0 rejecting this suggests they did not want to part with that much high-value resource for relatively low-value resources, or they value Brick/Ore highly.\n    *   My successful trade: 10 Wood (80 value), 5 Sheep (65 value) -> Requested: 3 Brick (90 value). Offered value: 145. Requested value: 90. I *lost* 55 value in this explicit calculation. **Correction in analysis:** This was a *successful* trade, meaning *I* offered something and *they* accepted. This means I gave up 145 value for 90 value. This was a *bad* trade for me in terms of pure value transfer. **Rethink:** Player 0 *accepted* this offer from me. This means I gave up Wood and Sheep, and got Brick. It was a bad trade if I look at offered vs. requested value *for me*. However, the instructions state \"your task is to trade such that the total value of your resources increases.\" This trade *decreased* my total value. This previous trade was a mistake based on this objective. I need to be more careful.\n    *   **Revised Understanding of previous successful trade:** I offered 10 Wood (80) + 5 Sheep (65) = 145 value. I received 3 Brick (90 value). My total value *decreased* by 55. This was a tactical error. I need to avoid this going forward. Player 0 accepted it because it was good for them.\n\n8.  **Current Resources and Values (After the last trade):**\n    *   Wheat: 6 (Value: 30)\n    *   Wood: 19 - 10 = 9 (Value: 72)\n    *   Sheep: 13 - 5 = 8 (Value: 104)\n    *   Brick: 6 + 3 = 9 (Value: 270)\n    *   Ore: 9 (Value: 360)\n    *   **Total Value: 30 + 72 + 104 + 270 + 360 = 836** (Initial total: 6*5 + 19*8 + 13*13 + 6*30 + 9*40 = 30 + 152 + 169 + 180 + 360 = 891). *My value has decreased, which is bad.*\n\n9.  **Going Forward - New Strategy:** I must *only* propose trades where the value of requested items explicitly exceeds the value of offered items, or where I exchange many low-value items for fewer high-value items, with a net positive value gain. Given Player 0 accepted a bad trade from me, they might be willing to accept another one if it's still beneficial for them. I need to make trades that are good for *me*. Player 0's previous rejections suggest they value their high-value resources (like Brick and Ore) highly.\n\n10. **Priorities:**\n    *   Acquire Ore (40 value) and Brick (30 value).\n    *   Offload Wheat (5 value) and Wood (8 value).\n    *   Use Sheep (13 value) as a bargaining chip if necessary, but carefully.\n\nPlayer 0 made no new trade offer.\nPlayer 1 rejected the trade offer.\nMy last trade was a net negative for me. I need to be extremely careful.\n\nNow, I need to make an offer. I'm looking to increase my total value.\nResources: Wheat (6), Wood (9), Sheep (8), Brick (9), Ore (9)\n\nI want to give up low-value items for high-value items.\nConsider requesting Ore (40) or Brick (30).\nConsider offering Wheat (5) or Wood (8).\n\nLet's target Ore. It's the most valuable.\nWhat can I give for 1 Ore (40 value)?\n*   8 Wheat = 40 value. (I only have 6 Wheat)\n*   5 Wood = 40 value. (I have 9 Wood) -> Offer: 5 Wood (40) -> 1 Ore (40). This is a parity trade, no net gain. I need a *gain*.\n*   3 Sheep = 39 value. (I have 8 Sheep)\n\nI need to make an offer that results in a value increase for me.\nMaybe offer low-value resources for a combination of high-value resources.\n\nWhat if I ask for 2 high-value resources for many low-value ones?\nRequest: 1 Brick (30) + 1 Ore (40) = 70 value.\nOffer:\n*   6 Wheat (30) + 5 Wood (40) = 70 value. (Parity again)\n*   6 Wheat (30) + 3 Sheep (39) = 69 value. (Slight loss for me)\n*   6 Wheat (30) + 4 Wood (32) = 62 value. (Loss for me)\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nCan I offer a lot of my low-value resources for 1 Ore?\nI have 6 Wheat (30) and 9 Wood (72).\nIf I offer 6 Wheat (30) + 3 Wood (24) = 54 value. Request 1 Ore (40) or 1 Brick (30).\nIf I request 1 Ore (40) for 54 value offered, that's a loss for me.\n\nThe previous trade was costly. I need to ensure a clear value gain.\n\nWhat if I offer 6 Wheat (30) for 1 Brick (30)? This is a direct swap of same value, but converts my lowest value resource to a higher value resource by quantity. If Player 0 needs wheat, this could work. But my objective is *total value increase*.\n\nLet's try for 1 Ore (40).\nOffer: 6 Wheat (30) + 2 Sheep (26) = 56 value. Request 1 Ore (40). This is a loss of 16 for me. No.\n\nI need to be more aggressive in requesting value, or very conservative in offering it.\n\nLet's try offering a mix of my plentiful low-value resources for a single high-value one, with a positive value difference for me.\n\nMy current *valuable* resource counts: Brick (9), Ore (9). I have a decent amount.\nMy *less valuable* resources: Wheat (6), Wood (9), Sheep (8).\n\nI want to decrease the number of low-value items and increase high-value items.\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of low-value items for a single valuable one?\nOffer: 5 Wood (value 40)\nRequest: 1 Ore (value 40)\nThis is an even trade in terms of total value, but I lose 5 Wood and gain 1 Ore. I'm consolidating value, but not increasing total value.\nThe instruction is \"total value of your resources increases\".\n\nI need a profitable trade.\nPerhaps offer resources Player 0 might need, but demand a higher-value resource in return.\nPlayer 0 accepted 10 Wood, 5 Sheep for 3 Brick. This suggests they might value Wood and Sheep, or are willing to accumulate them to trade.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nOffer: 6 Wheat (30) + 5 Wood (40) = 70 value.\nIf I request 2 Ore (80 value)? This is a gain of 10 value. It's a significant ask.\nIf I request 1 Ore (40) + 1 Brick (30)? This is exactly 70 value offered for 70 value received. It's value-neutral. Not good enough.\n\nI need to offer less value than I receive.\nHow about offering a good deal for Player 0, but still a net gain for me?\n\nOffer: 6 Wheat (30) + 3 Wood (24) = Total 54 value\nRequest: 2 Brick (60 value)\nThis is a gain of 6 value (60 - 54).\nIt converts my whole Wheat stock and some Wood into high-value Brick. I think this is a good offer. Player 0 gets a decent amount of Wheat and Wood.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Resource Scarcity and Value Hierarchy**: The value of resources increases with scarcity and utility. Ore (value 38) and Brick (value 28) are the highest-value resources in my inventory, indicating they are likely in high demand or critical for progression. I should be cautious when trading them, especially in large quantities.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost**: Each trade must be evaluated not only by immediate gain but also by what I give up. For example, sacrificing low-value resources (e.g., Wheat at value 6) to obtain high-value ones (e.g., Brick or Ore) is generally favorable.\n\n3. **Trade Efficiency**: Ideal trades involve exchanging surplus or low-value-to-me resources for scarce or high-value ones. I have large quantities of Wheat (22), Wood (15), and Sheep (22), which are of lower individual value compared to Brick and Ore. This suggests I can leverage these to acquire more valuable resources.\n\n4. **Negotiation Positioning**: Accepting trade offers that improve total inventory value increases my standing. The previous accepted trade (giving 3 Brick \u2192 receiving 10 Wood, 5 Sheep) was favorable only if Brick was surplus and Wood/Sheep were needed; however, given Brick\u2019s high value (28), giving up 3 Brick (84 total value) for 10 Wood (100) and 5 Sheep (65) \u2014 net gain ~61 in raw value \u2014 appears beneficial only if Brick is less useful or I have strong demand for Wood/Sheep.\n\n5. **Pattern Recognition**: Player 1 consistently requests Brick and occasionally Ore \u2014 high-value resources. This signals that Player 1 may be resource-constrained in production of high-tier items. I can exploit this by demanding premium returns when trading Brick.\n\n6. **Strategic Patience**: Not making an offer every turn is acceptable. Waiting for high-value opportunities or crafting counter-offers that maximize value gain is superior to forced trades.\n\n7. **Marginal Utility**: My current Brick stock is now reduced from 8 to 5 after the last trade. Losing more Brick risks losing strategic leverage. Hence, future offers requesting Brick should be met with high-value returns.\n\n8. **Offer Structure**: A strong offer should either eliminate excess low-value stock (Wheat, Wood) in exchange for high-value inflows (Ore, Brick), or balance surplus resources to optimize total portfolio value.\n\nCurrent status after last accepted trade:\n- Wheat: 22\n- Wood: 15 + 10 = 25\n- Sheep: 22 + 5 = 27\n- Brick: 8 - 3 = 5\n- Ore: 11\n\nPlayer 1 now offers: [6 Wheat, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick]\n\nEvaluation:\n- I receive: 2 Brick (2 \u00d7 28 = 56 value)\n- I give: 6 Wheat (6 \u00d7 6 = 36), 3 Wood (3 \u00d7 10 = 30) \u2192 Total outgoing value: 66\n- Net value change: 56 - 66 = -10 \u2192 **Unfavorable**\n\nAlthough I gain in high-value resource (Brick), the value outflow exceeds inflow. I have plenty of Wheat and Wood, but giving up 66 value to gain 56 is a net loss.\n\nHowever, if I lack Brick for strategic purposes, small losses might be acceptable \u2014 but I must weigh options.\n\nBut: I already have 5 Brick. This offer gives me 2 more (\u21927), but at a net value cost.\n\nBetter strategy: Counter with improved terms or reject and wait.\n\nBut I can only accept, deny, or make an offer.\n\nSince the offer is suboptimal, default action is [Deny], unless I can make a better offer.\n\nInstead, I can make a new, more favorable offer leveraging my surplus.\n\nI have excess Sheep (27) and Wood (25), Wheat (22). Brick is now scarcer (5).

Possibly, but it's +value and worth trying.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n- Deny current offer (net loss)\n- Make own optimized offer\n\nBut I can only do one action: either [Deny], or [Offer], or [Accept].\n\nI cannot do both [Deny] and [Offer] in one turn \u2014 the format suggests one action per turn.\n\nLooking at history: \u201cPlayer 0 made no new trade offer.\u201d after previous turn \u2014 so I can choose to make an offer or not.\n\nThe turn structure: at each turn, I can either respond to incoming offer ([Accept]/[Deny]) or make a new one ([Offer: ...]), or do nothing.\n\nBut typically, if there\u2019s an incoming offer, I must accept or deny, and *optionally* make a new one? Or is it one action?\n\nFrom game log:  \n\"Player 0 made no new trade offer.\" \u2014 implies that making an offer is optional.\n\nSo likely: I can [Accept] or [Deny] the incoming offer, and *in addition*, I can make a new [Offer].\n\nBut the instruction says: \"Use the following special tokens for actions\" \u2014 plural \u2014 but format doesn't show multiple.\n\nLooking at example: no instance of combined actions.\n\nIn turn 3: \u201cPlayer 0 accepted the trade offer from Player 1. Player 0 made no new trade offer.\u201d\n\nSo acceptance is separate, and then decision to make offer.\n\nBut in the token format, it\u2019s not specified.\n\nTo be safe, assume: I can [Accept] or [Deny], and I can independently [Offer].\n\nBut tokens are atomic.\n\nPerhaps: each action is a line.\n\nBut instruction: \u201cuse the following special tokens\u201d\n\nBest interpretation: I output one or more of the tokens.\n\nBut examples in log are: \u201caccepted the trade offer\u201d, then \u201cmade no new trade offer\u201d \u2014 so it logs in two parts.\n\nFor simplicity, and since the current offer is bad, I will [Deny] it and then make a new [Offer].\n\nBut to follow format, I need to output the action(s).\n\nPerhaps the standard is to respond to incoming offer, then optionally make an offer.\n\nBut the tokens are listed as options.\n\nTo align with format, I will:\n\nFirst, deny the current offer.\n\nThen, make a new offer.\n\nSo output:\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Brick]\n\nBut is that allowed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only one token per turn.\n\nBut in the log, after \u201cPlayer 0 accepted...\u201d, it says \u201cPlayer 0 made no new trade offer.\u201d \u2014 suggesting that \u201caccept\u201d and \u201cmake offer\u201d are separate.\n\nSo likely, I can do both.\n\nTherefore:\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I should always aim to trade resources I value less for resources I value more, or trade a smaller quantity of high-value resources for a larger quantity of even higher-value resources.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** I have a clear internal valuation for each resource ([Wheat]: 5, [Wood]: 8, [Sheep]: 13, [Brick]: 30, [Ore]: 40). I should base all my trading decisions on these values.\n3.  **Identify Surplus/Deficit:** I have large quantities of [Wood] (19) and [Sheep] (13), and sufficient [Wheat] (6). My [Brick] (6) and [Ore] (9) are relatively lower in quantity but high in value. [Brick] and [Ore] are my most valuable resources. I should acquire more of these.\n4.  **Opponent's Probable Needs:** Player 0 previously offered to take [Wheat] and [Sheep] in exchange for [Brick]. This suggests they value [Brick] less than I do, or are willing to part with it for resources they need. They also *rejected* my previous offers that included [Ore], which might mean they value [Ore] highly, or don't need it. However, they *accepted* my offers for [Brick] in exchange for [Wood] and [Sheep]/[Wheat]. This indicates a willingness to trade [Brick] for lower-value goods.\n5.  **Previous Successful Trades:** My last two accepted trades involved offering [Wood], [Sheep], and [Wheat] for [Brick]. This is a strong indicator of Player 0's trading preferences.\n6.  **Current Offer Analysis:** Player 0 is offering 10 [Wheat] (Value: 50) and 5 [Wood] (Value: 40) for 3 [Brick] (Value: 90). The incoming offer has a total value of 90 on their side for 90 on my side, which is a 1:1 value exchange. This is not directly increasing my total value. However, it's a good trade *if* I consider [Wheat] and [Wood] as resources I am more willing to part with for high-value [Brick].\n7.  **Strategic Acceptance/Denial:** Accepting this offer would decrease my [Brick] significantly, which is my third most valuable resource. While I have relatively high quantities of [Wheat] and [Wood], giving up 3 [Brick] for them *does not* increase my total value, it keeps it the same. My goal is to increase total value. Therefore, this offer, despite being a 1:1 value exchange, is not beneficial for my core goal. I should aim for a trade where the value of what I receive is greater than the value of what I give.\n\nCurrent Resources and Value:\n*   [Wheat]   Qty: 6    Value: 30 (6 * 5)\n*   [Wood]    Qty: 19   Value: 152 (19 * 8)\n*   [Sheep]   Qty: 13   Value: 169 (13 * 13)\n*   [Brick]   Qty: 6    Value: 180 (6 * 30)\n*   [Ore]     Qty: 9    Value: 360 (9 * 40)\n*   **Total Value: 891** (before this turn's actions)\n\nPlayer 0's offer: 10 [Wheat] (Value 50), 5 [Wood] (Value 40) -> 3 [Brick] (Value 90)\n\nIf I accept this:\nGive: 3 Brick (Value 90)\nReceive: 10 Wheat (Value 50), 5 Wood (Value 40)\nThe value exchange is 90 for 90. This does *not* increase my total value. I would be trading a high-value resource for lower-value resources, even if the total value is equal. This is contrary to my goal of *increasing* total value.\n\nMy preferred strategy is to acquire [Brick] and [Ore], and possibly offload [Wood], [Wheat], and [Sheep]. This offer from Player 0 is asking for my valuable [Brick] for less valuable resources. I should not accept this. Instead, I should make a counter-offer that gains me [Brick] or [Ore]. Since Player 0 has accepted [Wood] and [Wheat] for [Brick] before, I will try to buy [Brick] from them.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Value Maximization**: My goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I should aim to trade away lower-value resources (like Wheat at 6 and Wood at 10) for higher-value ones (like Brick at 28 and Ore at 38). Any trade that converts lower-value units into higher-value units improves my position.\n\n2. **Resource Abundance vs. Scarcity**: I have high quantities of Wheat (22), Sheep (22), and Ore (11), while Brick (8) and Wood (15) are relatively lower but not critically low. However, since Brick has the second-highest value (28), it's likely in high demand. I can leverage this by trading excess Wheat or Wood for more Brick.\n\n3. **Trading Efficiency**: Offers should be structured so that the value I receive exceeds the value I give. For example, trading 10 Wheat (value 60 total) and 5 Wood (50) for 3 Brick (84) yields a net gain of 84 - 110 = -26 \u2014 a loss. That previous offer was unfavorable and rightly rejected.\n\n4. **Perceived Value vs. Actual Value**: Other players may value resources differently. Player 1 has repeatedly offered Wood and Wheat for Brick, indicating they desire Brick and have surplus Wood/Wheat. I should exploit this by requesting more value in return.\n\n5. **Past Trade Analysis**:  \n   - I accepted: 10 Wood + 5 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick.  \n     Offered: 10\u00d710 + 5\u00d713 = 100 + 65 = 165 value.  \n     Received: 3\u00d728 = 84. Net loss: -81.  \n     This was a poor trade \u2014 likely done out of impatience.  \n   - I accepted: 6 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick  \n     Offered: 6\u00d76 + 3\u00d710 = 36 + 30 = 66  \n     Received: 2\u00d728 = 56. Net loss: -10.  \n     Also suboptimal.  \n   - Both accepted trades were value-negative. I must improve.\n\n6. **Strategic Discipline**: Even if an offer seems tempting, I must reject if it decreases total value. Patience and discipline are key. The game lasts 10 turns; I still have time to make better deals.\n\n7. **Optimal Offer Design**: Focus on trading excess low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for high-value (Brick, Ore). But ensure value-in > value-out.  \n   Example: 5 Wheat (30) + 5 Wood (50) = 80 value. Can request at least 3 Brick (84) to break even, or 4 Wheat? No \u2014 better to request Ore or 3+ Brick. But Ore is high value (38), so hard to get.\n\n8. **Leverage and Bargaining Power**: Since I have 8 Brick (high value), others may want them. I should *sell* Brick sparingly, only for high-value returns. But since I\u2019m trying to *increase* total value, I should actually seek to acquire Brick and Ore \u2014 not give them away.\n\n   Correction: I have only 8 Brick \u2014 a medium amount at high value. Best not to trade them away unless receiving Ore or equivalent high value.\n\n9. **Current Inventory After Trades**:  \n   Let's track post-trade holdings:  \n   Initial:  \n     Wheat: 22, Wood: 15, Sheep: 22, Brick: 8, Ore: 11  \n\n   After first accepted trade: -10 Wood, -5 Sheep, +3 Brick  \n     \u2192 Wood: 5, Sheep: 17, Brick: 11  \n\n   Second accepted trade: -6 Wheat, -3 Wood, +2 Brick  \n     \u2192 Wheat: 16, Wood: 2, Brick: 13  \n\n   So current holdings:  \n     Wheat: 16  \n     Wood: 2  \n     Sheep: 17  \n     Brick: 13  \n     Ore: 11  \n\n   Wood is now very low. Wheat and Sheep are still in surplus.\n\n   I should avoid trading Wood now; instead, trade Wheat or Sheep for Ore or Brick, but only if value-in > value-out.\n\n10. **New Offer Strategy**:  \n   - Best to offer Wheat (value 6) or Sheep (13) \u2014 both relatively abundant.  \n   - Request Brick (28) or Ore (38).  \n   - Example: Offering 5 Sheep (65) \u2192 Request 2 Ore (76)? Good return.  \n   - Or 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat (39 + 30 = 69) \u2192 Request 2 Brick (56)? Too low \u2014 waste.  \n   - Better: 7 Wheat (42) \u2192 1 Brick (28)? No, unfavorable.  \n   - Reverse: Trade Brick only for Ore. But others may not want Brick?  \n   - Wait \u2014 I have 13 Brick now (highest quantity), value 28 each. But still valuable.\n\n   Actually, best action: Offer low-value resources (Wheat) in quantity for high-value (Ore).  \n   Example: 10 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore (38) \u2192 value out: 60, value in: 38 \u2192 bad.  \n   Not working.  \n   Alternative: Offer Sheep (value 13) which I have 17 of.  \n   3 Sheep (39) \u2192 1 Ore (38): nearly even, slight loss.  \n   But if I offer 3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore and 1 Wheat? Then net gain.  \n\n   However, current Wood is only 2 \u2014 very low. I may need it later.  \n   Goal: Increase total value. Current total value:  \n   16\u00d76 + 2\u00d710 + 17\u00d713 + 13\u00d728 + 11\u00d738  \n   = 96 + 20 + 221 + 364 + 418 =  \n   96+20=116; 116+221=337; 337+364=701; 701+418 = **1,119**\n\n   Any trade that increases this sum is good.\n\n   Best path: Acquire **Ore** (38) and **Brick** (28), give up **Wheat** (6) and **Sheep** (13).\n\n   But must trade surplus. I have low Wood (2) \u2014 avoid trading.\n\n   Player 1 seems to want Brick. But I should no longer give Brick away \u2014 instead, try to collect it.\n\n   Wait \u2014 I already have 13 Brick. I could use some as leverage if others want them, but better to keep unless high-value return.\n\n   Player 1 previously offered 10 Wood + 5 Sheep for 3 Brick \u2014 I accepted, which hurt me.\n\n   Now, I should reverse: use Wheat or Sheep to buy Ore.\n\n   But Player 1 hasn\u2019t offered Ore. I must initiate.\n\n   Since Player 1 values Brick, perhaps they also have Ore? Unlikely \u2014 but possible.\n\n   New offer idea: Use excess **Sheep** (17) and **Wheat** (16) to request **Ore**.\n\n   Example: [Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]  \n   Value out: 4\u00d713 + 2\u00d76 = 52 + 12 = 64  \n   Value in: 38 \u2192 net loss \u2014 bad.\n\n   Must request more. But hard to get Ore.\n\n   Alternative: Target Brick \u2014 lower value but still useful.\n\n   [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick] \u2192 30 out, 28 in \u2192 very close, slight loss.\n\n   But maybe accepted? Not worth it.\n\n   Better: [Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick] \u2192 12+13=25 out, 28 in \u2192 +3 net gain. Good.\n\n   Even better: [Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat] \u2192 gives net 2 Wheat and 1 Sheep for 1 Brick. Value: in 28+6=34, out 18+13=31 \u2192 +3 gain.\n\n   But complex.\n\n   Simpler: [Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick] \u2192 13+12=25 out, 28 in \u2192 +3.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   But can I do better?\n\n   Try for Ore: [Offer: 6 Sheep -> 2 Ore] \u2192 78 out, 76 in \u2192 slight loss.\n\n   [Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore] \u2192 65 out, 76 in \u2192 +11 gain \u2014 excellent.\n\n   But will Player 1 have 2 Ore to give?\n\n   Unclear. But must try.\n\n   Given that my recent offers were rejected or accepted only when overpriced (to my detriment), I need to offer fair or slightly favorable terms.\n\n   Best move: Propose a high-value gain offer.\n\n   But also: observe that Player 1 made no new offer last round \u2014 perhaps they're waiting.\n\n   Strategic pause or disengaged?\n\n   I should make an offer that is:\n\n   - Attractive to Player 1\n   - Net value gain for me\n   - Uses my surplus (Wheat, Sheep)\n\n   Player 1 has offered Wood and Wheat previously \u2014 so they may have Wood surplus. But I already have little Wood \u2014 don't want to trade more away.\n\n   What might Player 1 want? Brick. I have 13 \u2014 I can *sell* a few, but only for high return.\n\n   Idea: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore] \u2192 value 28 out, 38 in \u2192 +10 gain \u2014 excellent.\n\n   But will Player 1 give 1 Ore for 1 Brick? Possibly \u2014 if they value Brick higher.\n\n   Ore is more valuable (38), so likely Player 1 won\u2019t accept. But in Catan-style games, Brick is often bottleneck early.\n\n   Still, worth trying.\n\n   Alternative: [Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood] \u2192 out: 56, in: 38+10=48 \u2192 loss.

Bad.\n\n   No.\n\n   [Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick] = +3 \u2014 good, small gain.\n\n   But I already have many Brick \u2014 do I need more?\n\n   Prioritize Ore.\n\n   Attempt: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore] \u2014 minimal risk, high reward.\n\n   If Player 1 values Brick more, they might accept.\n\n   Even if I lose Brick (28), I gain Ore (38) \u2192 net +10.\n\n   Excellent.\n\n   But only if they accept.\n\n   Other idea: bundle with lower-value goods to sweeten.\n\n   [Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Wheat]  \n   Out: 13 + 28 = 41, In: 38 + 6 = 44 \u2192 +3.\n\n   Acceptable, but unnecessary.\n\n   Best: try pure [Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\n   But I have 13 Brick \u2014 can afford to trade 1 if net gain.\n\n   However, risk of rejection.\n\n   But my goal is to *increase* value \u2014 this trade does so.\n\n   Alternatively: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick] \u2014 36 out, 28 in \u2192 loss. Never.\n\n   After careful analysis, the best high-reward offer is:\n\n   [Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\n\n   Net gain: +11\n\n   Or:\n\n   [Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore] \u2014 gain +10, simpler.\n\n   But 5 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore is better gain.\n\n   However, I have 17 Sheep \u2014 5 is manageable.\n\n   Commit.\n\n   I will make the offer:\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n*   **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This requires understanding the value of each resource I possess and the value of resources I can acquire.\n*   **Current Inventory Analysis:**\n    *   Wheat: Qty: 6, Value: 5 (Total: 30) - Low value, relatively abundant. Potential for trading.\n    *   Wood: Qty: 19, Value: 8 (Total: 152) - Moderate value, very abundant. Good for trading.\n    *   Sheep: Qty: 13, Value: 13 (Total: 169) - Moderate-high value, abundant.

I want more of this, or to give it up only for extremely good deals.\n*   **Trading Strategy (General):**\n    1.  **Identify High-Value Targets:** Brick and Ore are my highest value resources. I should aim to acquire more of these.\n    2.  **Identify Low-Value expendable resources:** Wheat and Wood have lower per-unit value and I have many of them. These are prime candidates for offering in trades. Sheep are in between.\n    3.  **Calculate Value Ratios:** When evaluating an offer or making one, calculate the total value of what I'm giving up vs. what I'm getting. The goal is `Value_Received > Value_Offered`.\n    4.  **Consider Player 0's Past Behavior:** Player 0 seems to be interested in Brick (as evidenced by their past offers for it, and my successful trades for it). They offered Wheat and Wood for Brick. They also recently offered Sheep and Wheat for Ore, indicating they value Ore highly (or need it).\n    5.  **Current Offer Analysis:** Player 0 is offering 4 Sheep (Value: 4 * 13 = 52) and 2 Wheat (Value: 2 * 5 = 10) for 1 Ore (Value: 40).\n        *   Value Offered by Player 0: 52 + 10 = 62\n        *   Value Requested by Player 0: 40\n        *   From my perspective, this offer is: I give 1 Ore (40 value), they give 4 Sheep + 2 Wheat (62 value).\n        *   This is a net gain of 22 value (62 - 40 = 22).\n*   **Negotiation Tactics:**\n    *   **Accept favorable offers:** If an offer clearly increases my total value, I should accept it.\n    *   **Make counter-offers:** If an offer is poor, but shows an intent for a specific resource, I could counter with a more favorable exchange.\n    *   **Be patient but proactive:** Don't wait too long, but don't jump on bad deals.\n    *   **Understand scarcity/abundance:** My large quantities of Wood might make it cheaper for me to trade with, while my limited, high-value Ore should be traded rarely and ONLY when it significantly increases my wealth.\n\n**Decision Based on Current Offer:**\n\nThe current offer from Player 0 is: Offered items: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore.\nMy resources:\n    *   [Wheat]   Qty: 6    Value: 5\n    *   [Wood]    Qty: 19   Value: 8\n    *   [Sheep]   Qty: 13   Value: 13\n    *   [Brick]   Qty: 6    Value: 30\n    *   [Ore]     Qty: 9    Value: 40\n\nValue of resources Player 0 is offering me: (4 * 13) + (2 * 5) = 52 + 10 = 62.\nValue of resources Player 0 is requesting from me: 1 * 40 = 40.\n\nIf I accept this trade, my total value will increase by 62 - 40 = 22.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: Your resources have an intrinsic value, with Ore (38) > Brick (28) > Sheep (13) > Wood (10) > Wheat (6). Prioritize acquiring higher-value resources (Ore, Brick) and be cautious when giving them away.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost**: When trading, evaluate what you are giving up versus what you are gaining. For example, trading low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for high-value ones (Brick, Ore) improves total portfolio value.\n\n3. **Surplus Exploitation**: You have large quantities of Wheat (22) and Sheep (22). These can be used as bargaining chips, especially since their individual value is low\u2014trading surplus to acquire scarce, high-value resources is optimal.\n\n4. **Scarcity and Demand**: Brick (only 8) and Ore (11) are relatively scarce in your inventory, and both have high value. Brick appears to be in demand by Player 1, as they've repeatedly requested it in trades. You can leverage this demand to get better deals.\n\n5. **Incremental Gains**: Small, favorable trades accumulate over time. Accepting offers that net a positive value exchange\u2014even in small amounts\u2014is better than holding out for perfect trades that may never come.\n\n6. **Counterparty Behavior**: Player 1 repeatedly requests Brick and offers Wood, Wheat, and Sheep. They seem to lack Brick and may be willing to overpay. Exploit this by requesting high-value returns (e.g., Ore or multiple Bricks) when giving Brick.\n\n7. **Trade Efficiency**: Aim for trades where the **value received / value given** ratio > 1. For example, giving 10 Wood (value 100) to get 3 Brick (value 84) is a net loss\u2014only accept if part of a larger strategy.\n\n8. **Inventory Flexibility**: Reducing excess of low-value items increases agility. Trading surplus Wheat and Wood for Ore or Brick improves both value and utility.\n\n9. **Patience and Timing**: Just because an offer is made doesn\u2019t mean it must be accepted. But repeated rejection may stall progress. Balance patience with proactive, calculated offers.\n\n10. **Trade Leverage**: Since you have Brick, which Player 1 wants, and Player 1 has Wood and Wheat (which you have plenty of), your leverage is strong. Use it to request high-value items like Ore.\n\nApplication:  \nPlayer 1 has just made no new offer. The last trade was Player 0 offering 4 Sheep and 2 Wheat (4\u00d713 + 2\u00d76 = 52 + 12 = 64 value given) for 1 Ore (38 value received). This was a net loss in value, but may have been accepted to acquire scarce Ore.\n\nCurrent holdings after last trade:\n- Wheat: 22 - 2 = 20\n- Wood: 15 (unchanged)\n- Sheep: 22 - 4 = 18\n- Brick: 8 - 3 (first trade) - 2 (second trade) = 3\n- Ore: 11 + 1 = 12\n\nBrick is now very low (3), but still requested by Player 1. Player 1 continues to offer Wheat and Wood\u2014resources you already have in surplus.\n\nYou should make an offer that:\n- Uses surplus Wheat or Sheep\n- Acquires high-value Ore (value 38) or at least more Brick\n- Avoids giving Brick unless receiving significant value in return\n\nGood opportunity: Offer a mix of Sheep and Wheat (which you have plenty of) to get 1 Ore. Previous attempt (4 Sheep + 2 Wheat for 1 Ore) was accepted, but net negative. Can we do better?\n\nAlternatively, since you now have 12 Ore, and Ore is your highest-value resource, consider holding unless receiving exceptional value (e.g., multiple Bricks).\n\nBut Brick is low (3), and may be needed. Best to replenish.\n\nPlayer 1 has shown willingness to trade Wood and Wheat for Brick.\n\nCurrent offer opportunity: Propose giving a bit of Brick (say, 1 or 2), but only in exchange for multiple resources, especially including Ore.\n\nHowever, giving away Ore is costly. Alternatively, use low-value surplus to get Ore directly.\n\nGiven Player 1's behavior, they may accept a deal for Sheep + Wheat \u2192 Ore.\n\nTry: 5 Sheep + 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore  \nValue: (5\u00d713=65) + (5\u00d76=30) = 95 given \u2192 38 received \u2192 too high cost.\n\nBetter: 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore \u2192 (39+30=69 vs 38) still bad.\n\nBut Player 1 accepted 4 Sheep + 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore (52+12=64\u219238). They might accept even if inefficient.\n\nBut we want to improve total value, so should avoid such losses.\n\nAlternative: Offer 6 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 1 Brick  \nValue: (6\u00d76=36) + (3\u00d710=30) = 66 given \u2192 28 received \u2192 net loss.\n\nNo favorable trade in that direction.\n\nReverse: Since Player 1 wants Brick, and we have 3 left, offer **1 Brick \u2192 5 Wood + 3 Wheat**?  \nValue: 28 given \u2192 (5\u00d710=50)+(3\u00d76=18)=68 \u2192 net gain? Wait, no: we are *giving* Brick to *get* Wood/Wheat \u2014 that\u2019s bad, since we already have surplus Wood/Wheat.\n\nWrong direction.\n\nBetter: Use low-value items to get high-value items only.\n\nBut Player 1 hasn\u2019t offered Ore except when we requested. So we may need to propose a new type of trade.\n\nBest available strategy: Offer a combination of Sheep and Wheat for 1 Ore, but at better rate.\n\nTry: 3 Sheep + 3 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore  \nValue: 39+18=57 given \u2192 38 received. Still negative, but less so.\n\nBut we should aim to *increase* total value, not decrease.\n\nAlternative: Offer 8 Wheat + 2 Wood \u2192 1 Brick  \n(48+20=68 \u2192 28) \u2192 still loss.\n\nNo favorable trade using only low-value resources.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe no efficient trade is possible due to imbalance.\n\nBut previous trade was accepted even though unfavorable. So Player 1 may accept imbalanced offers.\n\nBut we want to **increase total value**, so we should only accept/give offers where value received > value given.\n\nBest current option: **Acquire Ore** \u2014 highest value. You have 12 now, but it's still valuable. Can we get it efficiently?\n\nPlayer 1 may not be willing to give Ore. You've only received 1 so far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to **get multiple Bricks** in exchange for surplus.\n\nBut you already gave up many Bricks.\n\nWait: Your last accepted offer was from you: 4 Sheep + 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore. You still have 3 Brick.\n\nWait, no: you gave 3 Brick in first trade, 2 Brick in second, total 5, but started with 8, so 3 left. You *did not give any Brick* in the 4 Sheep + 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore trade.\n\nSo current Brick: 3.\n\nPlayer 1 wants Brick. So **you can trade 1 Brick for a bundle of low-value items**, but only if it increases value.\n\nBut low-value items won\u2019t increase total value.\n\nUnless: trade 1 Brick \u2192 5 Wood + 5 Wheat + 1 Sheep? Unlikely.\n\nBetter: **Hold Brick** unless getting Ore in return.\n\nBut Player 1 is not offering Ore.\n\nSo perhaps no good outgoing offer now.\n\nBut you must act.\n\nAlternative strategy: Offer a trade that combines moderate surplus to get a high-value item.\n\nTry: Offer **1 Sheep + 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore**\n\nValue: 13 + 12 = 25 given \u2192 38 received = **+13 net value**\n\nThis is favorable! But will Player 1 accept?\n\nThey previously accepted 4 Sheep + 2 Wheat (64 value) for 1 Ore (38), so they might accept a better deal for us.\n\nBut we need them to *give* Ore for less.\n\nSo proposing 1 Sheep + 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore is very favorable for us.\n\nBut is it realistic? Probably not\u2014Player 1 would likely only give Ore for more.\n\nWait \u2014 earlier we **offered** 4 Sheep + 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore and **they accepted**.\n\nSo the market rate is around ~4 Sheep or equivalent for 1 Ore.\n\nBut now we want a better rate.\n\nSince we are trying to gain, we should propose a trade that is acceptable based on prior behavior but improves our value.\n\nWait \u2014 that trade *gave* us 1 Ore for 4 Sheep + 2 Wheat \u2014 that was **us offering**, and **they accepted**. So we already did that.\n\nWe need to **repeat** a similar transaction to get more Ore.\n\nBut with better terms? Not necessary \u2014 even at 4 Sheep + 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore, it's a net loss of 26 value, but may be necessary to acquire top-tier resource.\n\nBut goal is to **increase total value**, so we should avoid net-loss trades.\n\nAlternative: **Wait and see** \u2014 but game proceeds, and you have to act.\n\nOr: **Do not offer anything** \u2014 but then risk losing turns.\n\nBut the format requires a decision.\n\nBest insight: Since you have high surplus of Sheep and Wheat, and Ore has highest value, even moderately inefficient trades may be worthwhile if they help balance resource profile for later gains.\n\nBut strictly speaking, only **positive-sum trades** should be made.\n\nWait \u2014 what if you propose a trade that **gives Brick** but gets **Ore**?\n\nFor example: Offer 1 Brick \u2192 1 Ore\n\nValue: 28 \u2192 38 = +10 net.\n\nVery favorable.\n\nBut will Player 1 accept? They have been *requesting* Brick, not offering it.\n\nUnlikely they will trade Ore for Brick unless desperate.\n\nBut try?\n\nAlternatively: Offer **2 Brick + 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore**\n\nValue: 56 + 13 = 69 \u2192 38 \u2192 too much.\n\nNo.\n\nReverse: Request Ore in exchange for low-value.\n\nBut previous trade 4 Sheep + 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore was accepted.\n\nSo we can replicate that.\n\nLet's calculate total value before and after:\n\nCurrent holdings:\n- Wheat: 20\n- Wood: 15\n- Sheep: 18\n- Brick: 3\n- Ore: 12\n\nCurrent total value:\n= (20\u00d76) + (15\u00d710) + (18\u00d713) + (3\u00d728) + (12\u00d738)\n= 120 + 150 + 234 + 84 + 456\n= 1044\n\nIf we make: **4 Sheep, 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore**\nAfter:\n- Sheep: 14\n- Wheat: 18\n- Ore: 13\n\nValue: (18\u00d76)=108, (15\u00d710)=150, (14\u00d713)=182, (3\u00d728)=84, (13\u00d738)=494\nTotal = 108+150+182+84+494 = 1018 \u2192 decreased to 1018 from 1044.\n\nWait \u2014 but we did this trade already? No \u2014 this is the **second time**.\n\nIn the previous turn, you made this offer and it was accepted? Wait, let's check:\n\n\"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore\"\n\"Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\"\n\nYes, already happened once.\n\nSo doing it again would further reduce total value.\n\nNot wise.\n\nAlternative: Try to **get Brick** in exchange for Wheat and Wood, but efficiently.\n\nBut earlier trades:\n- First: gave 3 Brick for 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep? No \u2014 that was offered but **rejected**.\n\nThe only trades executed:\n1. 10 Wood, 5 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick (from Player 1 offer, accepted)\n   - You gave: 10\u00d710 + 5\u00d713 = 100 + 65 = 165\n   - You got: 3\u00d728 = 84\n   \u2192 Massive loss: \u221281 value \u2014 questionable move.\n\n2. 6 Wheat, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick\n   - Gave: 36 + 30 = 66\n   - Got: 56\n   \u2192 Loss: \u221210\n\n3. 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore\n   - Gave: 52 + 12 = 64\n   - Got: 38\n   \u2192 Loss: \u221226\n\nAll trades so far have been value-negative.\n\nTo recover, you need **positive-sum trades**.\n\nCurrent best idea: **Request Ore in exchange for nothing?** Impossible.\n\nOr: Offer **1 Brick** for **1 Ore** \u2014 value 28\u219238, +10.\n\nDespite low chance, it's rational to try.\n\nAlternatively, offer **3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore** (39\u219238), nearly even.\n\nOr **2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore** (26\u219238) = +12 \u2014 good.\n\nBut will they accept giving Ore for less?\n\nUnlikely.\n\nGiven Player 1\u2019s behavior, they are willing to give multiple Wood/Wheat for Brick.\n\nYou have 3 Brick left.\n\nOffer: **1 Brick \u2192 6 Wheat + 4 Wood**\n\nValue: 28 given \u2192 (36 + 40) = 76 \u2192 no: we\u2019re gaining 76 value in low-tier resources for 28? But we already have plenty.\n\nValue-wise, it\u2019s a gain, but utility-wise, not helpful.\n\nBut total value increases: 76 received vs 28 given.\n\nStill, accumulating more Wheat and Wood when already high is inefficient.\n\nBetter: get Ore.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nGiven that you have **low Brick (3)** and **relatively high Ore (12)**, and that previous offers showed Player 1 is willing to give combinations for Brick, but no benefit in trading Brick unless getting Ore.\n\nNo favorable outgoing trades seem available.\n\nBut you must act.\n\nBest move: Propose a **value-positive trade**.\n\nTry: **Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore**\n\nValue given: 30 + 39 = 69\nValue received: 38\n\u2192 Loss\n\nNo.\n\nWait \u2014 can we **offer Ore**?\n\nNo, Ore is valuable, don't give it.\n\nAlternative idea: Hold and wait \u2014 make no offer.\n\nBut the format may require an offer.\n\nLooking at history: \"Player 0 made no new trade offer.\" is allowed.\n\nBut in this turn, you can choose.\n\nSince all possible trades using surplus are net negative, and you already have 12 Ore, perhaps **stop trading for now**.\n\nBut the game continues.\n\nAnother idea: Trade **excess Wheat and Wood for nothing?** No.\n\nOr: **Player 1 may make another offer later**.\n\nGiven that the last interaction was: you made an offer (4S,2W\u21921O), accepted. Then Player 1 made no new offer.\n\nSo now it's your turn again.\n\nYou can wait.\n\nBut to be proactive: try a **favorable trade** based on previous patterns.\n\nBest insight: **You have too much Brick-demand, but low value from it.** Stop giving Brick for low-value gains.\n\nYou need to acquire more Ore, but efficiently.\n\nNo efficient way apparent.\n\nAlternatively, **offer 1 Brick \u2192 1 Ore** \u2014 even if rejected, it signals value.\n\nLet's calculate: giving 28 value for 38 \u2014 you gain 10.\n\nEven if Player 1 has no incentive, try.\n\nSo:\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nBut format requires both sides.\n\nOr: you are offering 1 Brick, requesting 1 Ore.\n\nBut that means: you give 1 Brick, get 1 Ore.\n\nYes.\n\nBut likely rejected.\n\nBut based on principles, it's a value-increasing move if accepted.\n\nAlternatively, offer nothing, keep current portfolio.\n\nBut we must make a decision.\n\nGiven the goal to increase total value, and no obviously favorable trade, but opportunity to trade surplus Sheep/Wheat for Ore at a loss that might be acceptable for strategic balance, but past such trades have already been done.\n\nWait \u2014 new idea: **You have 3 Brick. Offer 1 Brick for multiple low-value items that you can later trade.**\n\nBut you already have surplus.\n\nBetter: Do not offer anything.\n\nBut let's see the instruction.\n\nYou can [Offer], [Accept], or [Deny].\n\nNo offer received this turn, so not Accept or Deny.\n\nSo only [Offer] or implicitly do nothing.\n\nBut to be active, and since a previous favorable pattern exists, try a smaller offer to get Ore.\n\nTry: Offer: 3 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore\n\nValue: 39 + 18 = 57 given, 38 received \u2014 loss.\n\nStill not good.\n\nNo.\n\nFinal decision: Given that you have high-value resources now (Ore=12, Brick=3), and you've been losing value in trades, **hold and wait** for a better offer from Player 1.\n\nBut you can still make an offer.\n\nBest strategy: Since Player 1 wants Brick, and they have Wood and Wheat, but you have surplus of those, no trade is beneficial.\n\nUnless you can get Ore.\n\nBut no indication Player 1 has Ore to give.\n\nSo: make no offer.\n\nBut the format might expect [Deny] or [Offer].\n\nLooking at turn structure: after Player 1 makes an offer, you [Accept] or [Deny]. If not, you can make an [Offer].\n\nPlayer 1 made no new offer, so you can make an [Offer].\n\nBut if you don't want to trade, you can make no offer \u2014 as seen in history.\n\nSo it's allowed.\n\nBut to follow the format, you must output an action.\n\nSince the last Player 1 action was \"made no new trade offer\", then you can either make an offer or not.\n\nBut in the simulation, \"Player 0 made no new trade offer.\" is a valid action outcome.\n\nBut here, you must choose.\n\nOutput: \n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nEven if unlikely, it's value-positive if accepted.\n\nOr to increase probability, offer surplus:\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore] \u2014 but this has been done, and is value-losing.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nBetter: try to get something with no gain for them? No.\n\nAnother idea: offer 1 Brick -> 5 Wheat, 3 Wood\n\nValue: 28 given, 30+30=60 received.\n\nValue gain, but low-quality resources.\n\nBut total value increases.\n\nAnd you can later trade those for Ore indirectly.\n\nBut complicated.\n\nSince your goal is total value increase, any offer where received value > given value is acceptable.\n\nSo:\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 5 Wheat, 3 Wood]\n\nGiven: 28 value\nReceived: 5\u00d76 + 3\u00d710 = 30 + 30 = 60\nNet gain: +32\n\nVery good.\n\nPlayer 1 has been eager for Brick, and has lots of Wheat and Wood.\n\nLikely to accept.\n\nYes.\n\nDo it.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 5 Wheat, 3 Wood]",
