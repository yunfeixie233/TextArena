      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are relevant to my current situation as Player 0. First, **value maximization** is crucial: I should only make trades where the total value of resources I receive exceeds the value of what I give, based on my personal valuations (e.g., Ore at 37 value is more desirable than Wheat at 6). This ensures I increase my overall net worth.\n\nSecond, **resource abundance and scarcity** should guide decisions: I have high quantities of low-value resources like Wheat (22 qty, value 6) and moderate Wood (7 qty, value 8), which I can leverage to acquire scarcer or higher-value resources like Brick (value 28) or Ore (value 37). Trading excess low-value items reduces opportunity costs and allows me to build toward higher-value assets.\n\nThird, **negotiation tactics** are essential: Start with balanced offers that provide value to the other player while favoring me, to encourage counteroffers. Avoid overtrading in early turns (we have 10 total), and prioritize risk-averse moves\u2014e.g., don't deplete critical resources. Also, calculate net value gains: For instance, if I offer 10 Wheat (value 60) for 1 Ore (value 37), it's a loss, so I need to demand more or adjust.\n\nFourth, **game dynamics** matter: With limited turns, I should be proactive to secure gains early, but not desperate. Finally, **fairness perception** helps: Offers should seem equitable to foster future trades, but I always prioritize my goal of increasing total value from 1084 to higher.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nBased on the above knowledge, I'll focus on trading my abundant, low-value Wheat for higher-value resources like Ore or Brick to maximize my total value. I have 22 Wheat, which is excessive and low-value, so offering some of it makes sense. I'll propose trading 10 Wheat (total value: 10 * 6 = 60) for 1 Ore and 1 Brick (total value: 1 * 37 + 1 * 28 = 65), resulting in a net gain of 5 value.

First, **value maximization** is crucial; I should only make trades where the total value of resources I receive exceeds the value of what I give, based on my personal valuations (e.g., Ore at 37 value is more valuable to me than Wheat at 6). This ensures long-term growth in my resource portfolio. Second, **assessing scarcity and demand** helps: I have abundant Wheat (now 12 qty after the previous trade) and Sheep (17 qty), which are lower-value resources, so I should leverage them to acquire higher-value items like Ore (37 value) or Brick (28 value), especially since Player 1 previously accepted a trade involving Wheat, indicating their potential demand for it. Third, **negotiation leverage and reciprocity** matters\u2014Player 1 accepted my last offer (10 Wheat for 1 Ore and 1 Brick), so I can build on that by proposing similar deals that are slightly in my favor while remaining attractive to them, avoiding exploitative offers that might lead to denials. Fourth, with only 10 turns total, I need to prioritize **efficiency and iterative trading**, making offers that incrementally increase my value without overcommitting resources. Finally, **risk management** is key; I should diversify by not depleting one resource entirely and monitor for potential counter-offers or denials based on the other player's needs.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision:\nApplying this knowledge, my current resources after the previous trade are: Wheat (12 qty), Wood (7 qty), Sheep (17 qty), Brick (12 qty), and Ore (10 qty). I have excess Wheat, which is low-value (6 per unit), so I'll use it to target high-value Ore (37 per unit) to increase my total value.

      "response": "## Step 1: Evaluate the current resources and their values.\nFirst, let's assess the resources and their total value. The resources are: Wheat (Qty: 25, Value: 5), Wood (Qty: 8, Value: 10), Sheep (Qty: 5, Value: 18), Brick (Qty: 17, Value: 30), and Ore (Qty: 21, Value: 32). After accepting the first trade offer from Player 0, the quantities changed. Player 1 received 10 Wheat and gave away 1 Ore and 1 Brick. So, the updated quantities are: Wheat (Qty: 25 + 10 = 35), Wood (Qty: 8), Sheep (Qty: 5), Brick (Qty: 17 - 1 = 16), and Ore (Qty: 21 - 1 = 20).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the initial and current total value of resources.\nInitial total value = (25 * 5) + (8 * 10) + (5 * 18) + (17 * 30) + (21 * 32) = 125 + 80 + 90 + 510 + 672 = 1477.\nAfter the first trade: Total value = (35 * 5) + (8 * 10) + (5 * 18) + (16 * 30) + (20 * 32) = 175 + 80 + 90 + 480 + 640 = 1465.\nThe total value decreased by 12 after the first trade.\n\n## Step 3: Generate knowledge about resource trading and negotiation.\nKey principles include:\n1. **Value maximization**: Aim to increase the total value of resources.\n2. **Resource scarcity**: Identify resources that are scarce and potentially valuable.\n3. **Negotiation strategy**: Be prepared to negotiate based on the value and quantity of resources.\n4. **Trade evaluation**: Carefully evaluate incoming and outgoing trades to ensure they increase total value.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the new offer from Player 0.\nPlayer 0's new offer is: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore. The current quantities are: Wheat (35), Ore (20). After this trade, Wheat (35 + 10 = 45) and Ore (20 - 2 = 18).\nLet's calculate the change in total value: Receiving 10 Wheat = 10 * 5 = 50, Giving away 2 Ore = 2 * 32 = 64. The net change = 50 - 64 = -14.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on the new offer from Player 0.\nSince the net change is negative (-14), accepting this trade would decrease the total value of resources further.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the generated knowledge to make a trading decision for the current turn.\nTo increase the total value, we should either accept a trade that adds more value than it takes away or make a new offer that does so. The current offer from Player 0 is not beneficial.\n\n## Step 7: Consider making a new trade offer.\nLet's examine potential trades based on current resources and values. We have a surplus of Wheat and a relatively high quantity of Ore. We could offer resources that are less valuable to us in exchange for more valuable ones.\n\n## Step 8: Formulate a potential new trade offer.\nOne potential trade could involve offering Wheat (low value) for a resource that is more valuable. For example, offering Wheat for Ore or Brick could be considered, but since we already have a significant amount of Ore, offering Ore might not be the best. However, we can consider offering Wheat for Brick or Sheep, as these are relatively more valuable.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate potential trade offers.\nLet's consider: '[Offer: 10 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick]'. Current quantities: Wheat (35), Wood (8), Brick (16). After trade: Wheat (35 - 10 = 25), Wood (8 - 1 = 7), Brick (16 + 2 = 18).\nValue change: Losing 10 Wheat = 10 * 5 = 50, 1 Wood = 1 * 10 = 10, total loss = 60. Gaining 2 Brick = 2 * 30 = 60. Net change = 60 - 60 = 0.\nThis trade doesn't increase the total value.\n\n## Step 10: Consider an alternative trade.\nLet's consider: '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'. Current quantities: Wheat (35), Sheep (5). After trade: Wheat (35 - 5 = 30), Sheep (5 + 1 = 6).\nValue change: Losing 5 Wheat = 5 * 5 = 25. Gaining 1 Sheep = 1 * 18 = 18. Net change = 18 - 25 = -7.\nThis trade also doesn't increase the total value.\n\n## Step 11: Decide on the action for the current turn.\nGiven that the new offer from Player 0 is not beneficial, we should '[Deny]' the offer. We also need to consider making a new offer that could potentially increase our total resource value.\n\n## Step 12: Final decision based on the analysis.\nSince the offer from Player 0 (10 Wheat -> 2 Ore) is not beneficial, we will '[Deny]' it. Let's consider a new offer that could be beneficial, such as '[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep]' or similar, but we need to check if it increases the total value.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate a new potential trade.\nFor '[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep]': Losing 5 Wheat (25) and 1 Brick (30), total = 55. Gaining 2 Sheep (36), net change = 36 - 55 = -19. This is not beneficial.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Deny]}$",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nIn resource trading and negotiation, especially in a competitive game like this with limited turns (only 10 total), several key principles and strategies are crucial for maximizing the total value of my resources:\n\n- **Value Maximization**: Always evaluate trades based on net value gain. Compare the total value of resources offered versus those requested. If a trade increases my overall resource value, it's generally worth accepting, as the primary goal is to boost my portfolio's worth. For instance, prioritize trading low-value resources (like Wheat, valued at 6 per unit) for higher-value ones (like Ore at 37 per unit).\n\n- **Resource Abundance and Scarcity**: Trade resources I have in excess for those that are scarcer or more valuable to me. I have a high quantity of Wheat (22 units) and Sheep (17 units), which are relatively low-value, so I should be willing to offload them. Conversely, hold onto or demand high-value resources like Brick (28 per unit) and Ore (37 per unit) unless the return is significantly beneficial.\n\n- **Negotiation Tactics**: In a turn-based game, be strategic with offers and responses. Accept offers that provide a clear net gain to build momentum and value early. If an offer is suboptimal, counter with a better one, but avoid over-negotiating if it risks missing out on gains, especially since turns are limited. Start simple and escalate only if needed. For example, if I'm receiving more value than I'm giving, accepting can maintain goodwill for future trades.\n\n- **Risk Assessment**: Consider the game's short duration\u2014don't pass up immediate value gains that align with the objective, but weigh if the trade depletes key resources I might need later. In this case, with 10 turns, prioritize short-term value increases.\n\n- **Historical Context**: Learn from past interactions. I've successfully traded Wheat for Ore and Brick before, indicating that players value those resources highly. Player 1 recently rejected my offer for 2 Ore, suggesting they prioritize it, so I should leverage that in future offers if possible.\n\nThese insights are directly applicable here, as I must evaluate Player 1's incoming offer while considering my resource values and past trades.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nApplying the above principles, I'll first assess Player 1's offer: They are offering 10 Wheat and 1 Wood in exchange for 2 Brick from me.\n\n- **Value Calculation**: \n  - Resources offered to me: 10 Wheat (10 \u00d7 6 = 60 value) + 1 Wood (1 \u00d7 8 = 8 value) = Total 68 value.\n  - Resources I'd give: 2 Brick (2 \u00d7 28 = 56 value).\n  - Net gain: 68 - 56 = +12 value, which increases my total resource value.\n\nThis trade aligns with value maximization, as I'm gaining 12 value points without depleting critical resources excessively (I still have 9 Brick left after this). Given my abundance of Wheat and the limited turns, accepting this offer secures an immediate gain, which is a low-risk move. It also builds on my successful past trade with Player 1, potentially keeping negotiations open for future turns.\n\nHowever, I'm aware of my overall strategy: I have plenty of Wheat already, so in future turns, I might prioritize trading for higher-value resources like Ore. For now, this net gain makes it a smart decision.\n\n[Accept]",

      "response": "Below, I'll follow the instructions step by step. First, I'll generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation based on my current situation. Then, I'll apply that knowledge to make my trading decision.\n\n### Generate Knowledge\nBased on my situation in this Negotiation Game, where my goal is to increase the total value of my resources, here are the key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are most relevant:\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: Always evaluate trades based on the per-unit values of resources. For example, my resources have the following values: Wheat (6), Wood (8), Sheep (15), Brick (28), and Ore (37). I should only accept or propose trades where the total value of what I receive exceeds the total value of what I give, accounting for my current inventory. This ensures long-term gains, especially in a 10-turn game.\n\n2. **Resource Scarcity and Abundance**: Trade resources I have in surplus (e.g., Wheat and Sheep, which I have high quantities of and lower values) for resources that are scarcer for me or have higher values (e.g., Brick or Ore). From past interactions, Player 1 seems interested in Ore, as they've tried to acquire it, so I can leverage this to negotiate favorable terms.\n\n3. **Negotiation Strategy**: Start with offers that provide a slight advantage to the other player to build goodwill, but always aim for a net gain. Be cautious with counteroffers\u2014reject unfavorable deals and propose alternatives. For instance, if an incoming offer undervalues my resources (e.g., asking for high-value Ore in exchange for lower-value items), I should deny it and counter. In a competitive game, assume the other player is also maximizing their value, so monitor patterns (e.g., Player 1 rejected my offer of 10 Wheat for 2 Ore, indicating they value Ore highly).\n\n4. **Risk Management and Game Dynamics**: With only 10 turns, prioritize trades that immediately increase value while preserving resources for future turns. Avoid over-trading scarce items like Ore (value: 37), and use rejection as a tool to test the waters for better deals. Historical data shows Player 1 has accepted trades involving Wheat, so I can use that as leverage.\n\n5. **Psychological and Tactical Insights**: In negotiations, counteroffers can signal flexibility without weakness. For example, if Player 1 offers something unbalanced, I can deny and propose a revised trade that aligns with their interests (e.g., their desire for Ore) while benefiting me. This builds rapport and increases the chances of future agreements.\n\nThese principles apply directly to my current resources (Wheat: 22, Wood: 8, Sheep: 17, Brick: 10, Ore: 10) and the game history, where I've successfully traded Wheat for Ore and Brick but need to ensure ongoing trades net positive value.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nApplying the knowledge above, I'll first evaluate the incoming offer from Player 1: [Offered items: 2 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore].\n\n- **Value Analysis**: 2 Sheep have a total value of 2 * 15 = 30. In exchange, I'm giving 1 Ore, which has a value of 37. This trade would decrease my total resource value (30 < 37), violating the principle of value maximization. Additionally, Ore is one of my higher-value resources, and I should only trade it for something of greater or equal value, especially since I have abundant Sheep already.\n\n- **Strategic Consideration**: Based on scarcity and abundance, I have plenty of Sheep (17 quantity), so gaining more doesn't help me much. Player 1's repeated interest in Ore suggests I could counter with a better deal for them while gaining more value for myself. For example, I could propose trading 1 Ore for more Sheep or other resources that net me a gain.\n\nTherefore, I will deny the incoming offer. To follow up, I'll make a counteroffer that aligns with negotiation strategies: I'll offer 1 Ore (a resource they want) in exchange for resources I have in abundance (like Wheat or Sheep) but structure it so I gain value. Specifically, I'll propose trading 1 Ore for 3 Sheep. This gives me 3 Sheep (value: 3 * 15 = 45) in exchange for 1 Ore (value: 37), resulting in a net gain of 45 - 37 = 8 value points. It also tests Player 1's willingness to negotiate, as they've shown interest in Ore.\n\nFinal Actions:\n- [Deny]  // Deny the incoming offer from Player 1.\n- [Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep]  // Counteroffer to Player 1.",

      "response": "To generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation that applies to my situation, I need to analyze my current resources and their values, as well as the trades that have occurred so far in the game.\n\n### Current Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: 35 (25 + 10 from the first trade) - Value: 5\n- Wood: 8 - Value: 10\n- Sheep: 5 - Value: 18\n- Brick: 12 (17 - 2 from the second trade, but I actually gave 0 Brick and received 2 Brick, then gave 2 Brick, so it's 17 - 5 + 5 = 17, my calculation was wrong, I actually have 17 - 5 = 12 Brick)  - Value: 30\n- Ore: 20 (21 - 1 from the first trade) - Value: 32\n\nCorrected calculation:\n- Initially, I had 25 Wheat, 8 Wood, 5 Sheep, 17 Brick, 21 Ore.\n- After the first trade (accepted): I got 10 Wheat, lost 1 Ore, and 1 Brick. So, I have 35 Wheat, 8 Wood, 5 Sheep, 16 Brick, 20 Ore.\n- After the second trade: I offered 10 Wheat and 1 Wood and received 2 Brick. So, I have 25 Wheat, 7 Wood, 5 Sheep, 18 Brick, 20 Ore.\n- After the third trade: I offered 2 Sheep and requested 1 Ore. The trade was rejected, so my resources didn't change.\n- After Player 0's latest offer: I need to analyze the offer \"2 Sheep -> 1 Ore\". \n\n### Key Principles, Strategies, or Insights:\n1. **Value Comparison**: Compare the total value of resources offered versus requested. For the current offer from Player 0 (\"2 Sheep -> 1 Ore\"), the value of 2 Sheep is 2*18 = 36, and the value of 1 Ore is 32. Since 36 > 32, this trade is not favorable.\n\n2. **Resource Surplus/Deficit**: Identify surplus or scarce resources. I have relatively more Wheat and Ore compared to other resources. Wheat is not very valuable, and Ore is quite valuable.\n\n3. **Trading Strategy**: To increase the total value of my resources, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given my current resources and values, trading Wheat (Value: 5) for more valuable resources could be beneficial.\n\n4. **Negotiation Tactics**: Consider making offers that are slightly favorable to me but still reasonable for the other player. This could involve offering a resource I have in surplus for one that is more valuable.\n\n### Applying the Knowledge:\nGiven Player 0's latest offer (\"2 Sheep -> 1 Ore\"), it's not in my favor due to the higher value of Sheep compared to Ore. \n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- My Wheat is abundant and not very valuable. Trading some Wheat for more valuable resources could be a good strategy.\n- I could offer some Wheat for resources like Ore or Brick, which are more valuable.\n\n### Decision:\nConsidering the principles and my current situation, I will make a new trade offer. A potential trade could involve offering Wheat (since it's less valuable and I have a surplus) for a more valuable resource.\n\nLet's make an offer: '[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThis translates to: '[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThe action is: `[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`.",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation, especially in a competitive game with limited turns (like this one with only 10 turns), several key principles and strategies are crucial for maximizing the total value of my resources. Here's a summary of the most relevant ones based on my current situation:\n\n1. **Value-Based Decision Making**: Always calculate the net value gain or loss for any trade. Compare the total value of resources you're receiving against those you're giving up, using your personal valuation of resources. For example, if the incoming resources' value exceeds the outgoing ones, accept the trade. This ensures that each transaction increases your overall portfolio value. In my case, with resources like Ore (value 37) being highly valuable, I should be cautious about giving them up unless the return is significantly higher.\n\n2. **Scarcity and Opportunity Cost**: Prioritize trading resources you have in abundance for those that are scarcer or more valuable to you. I have a large quantity of Wheat (22) and Sheep (17), which could be used as leverage, while Ore (9) and Brick (11) are more valuable per unit. In a short game, avoid depleting high-value resources unless it leads to a clear net gain, and use historical data to gauge what the other player values (e.g., Player 1 has shown interest in Ore and Brick based on past offers).\n\n3. **Negotiation History and Opponent Behavior**: Analyze past interactions to predict future responses. From the history, Player 1 has accepted trades involving Wheat for Ore/Brick (e.g., they accepted my 10 Wheat for 1 Ore and 1 Brick) but rejected offers they perceived as unbalanced (e.g., 10 Wheat for 2 Ore). This suggests Player 1 values Ore highly but may be willing to trade Wheat (which they have in surplus) for it. Use this to craft offers that align with their preferences while favoring me, and avoid repeating rejected deals.\n\n4. **Risk and Turn Management**: In a time-limited game, prioritize immediate value gains to build momentum, but don't overcommit in one turn. If a trade is beneficial, accept it and follow up with a new offer to keep the negotiation going. However, if a deal is unfavorable, deny it to preserve resources for better opportunities later.\n\n5. **Strategic Offering**: When making offers, propose trades where the value ratio favors you (e.g., offer low-value resources for high-value ones) but remain realistic based on history. Start with balanced offers to encourage acceptance, and use abundance (like my Wheat) to test the waters without risking key assets.\n\nThese principles apply directly to my situation, where I need to evaluate incoming offers quickly and respond with counter-offers that exploit my surpluses while targeting high-value resources.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\n\nApplying the above knowledge to the current situation:\n\n- **Evaluate Incoming Offer**: Player 1's offer is 10 Wheat for 1 Ore. Based on my resource values:\n  - Value of incoming resources: 10 Wheat \u00d7 6 = 60\n  - Value of outgoing resources: 1 Ore \u00d7 37 = 37\n  - Net value gain: 60 - 37 = 23 (a positive gain)\n  This aligns with the value-based decision making principle, as it increases my total resource value. Additionally, from negotiation history, Player 1 has previously traded Wheat for Ore, indicating this might be a pattern, so accepting maintains goodwill for future trades. Given the game's short duration, securing this immediate gain is strategic.\n\n- **Decide on New Offer**: After accepting, I should make a new offer to continue building value. I have an abundance of Wheat, which Player 1 seems willing to trade away, so I'll offer 10 Wheat (value 60) for 1 Brick (value 28 to me). This would result in a net gain of 60 - 28 = 32 for me, fitting the scarcity principle (I'm trading excess Wheat for a higher-value resource) and past behavior (Player 1 has engaged in Brick-related trades). This keeps the negotiation active without overexposing my high-value resources.\n\n[Accept]  \n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

Let's correctly calculate: Initial Wheat = 25, after accepting 10 Wheat = 35, then after offering 10 Wheat, 1 Wood = 25, and after offering 2 Sheep = 25, and after offering 10 Wheat = 15. So, Wheat = 15 (since the last trade was 10 Wheat for 1 Ore).\n- Correct calculation:\n- Initial: Wheat = 25, Wood = 8, Sheep = 5, Brick = 17, Ore = 21.\n- After first trade (Accept: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick): Wheat = 35, Ore = 20, Brick = 16.\n- After second trade (Offer: 10 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick): Wheat = 25, Wood = 7, Brick = 18, Ore = 20.\n- After third trade (Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore): Sheep = 3, Ore = 21.\n- After fourth trade (Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore): Wheat = 15, Ore = 22.\nSo, the correct quantities are: Wheat = 15, Wood = 7, Sheep = 3, Brick = 18, Ore = 22.\n\n## Step 2: Generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation.\nKey principles include:\n1. **Value Optimization**: Aim to increase the total value of resources.\n2. **Resource Imbalance**: Identify resources that are abundant or scarce and trade accordingly.\n3. **Negotiation Strategies**: Be prepared to negotiate; offering something of value to you but less so to the other party can be beneficial.\n4. **Current Resource Values**:\n   - Wheat: 5\n   - Wood: 10\n   - Sheep: 18\n   - Brick: 30\n   - Ore: 32\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the current resource quantities and their total value.\nCurrent quantities and total value:\n- Wheat: 15 * 5 = 75\n- Wood: 7 * 10 = 70\n- Sheep: 3 * 18 = 54\n- Brick: 18 * 30 = 540\n- Ore: 22 * 32 = 704\nTotal value = 75 + 70 + 54 + 540 + 704 = 1443\n\n## Step 4: Determine the best course of action based on current resources and potential trades.\nTo increase the total value, we should consider trading resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable.

      "response": "### Generate Relevant Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are crucial for maximizing the total value of my resources, especially in a finite game with only 10 turns. First, **value-based decision-making** is essential: I should only propose or accept trades where the net value of resources I receive exceeds the value of what I give, based on the assigned values (e.g., Wheat at 6 value vs. Ore at 37 value). This ensures long-term gains. Second, **leverage abundance and scarcity**: I have a large quantity of low-value resources like Wheat (value 6), so I should trade these for higher-value resources like Ore (value 37) or Brick (value 28) that I lack or want more of. However, I must be cautious not to overtrade and deplete my stocks. Third, **analyze negotiation history**: From past interactions, Player 1 has accepted trades involving Wheat for Ore or Brick, indicating they value Wheat highly, but they've rejected offers like 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, suggesting they're protective of high-value resources. This allows me to start with reasonable, incremental offers to build trust. Fourth, **risk management in a turn-limited game**: With turns running out, I should prioritize quick, positive-value trades while avoiding desperation that leads to losses. Finally, **strategic offer design**: Offers should be balanced to encourage acceptance\u2014overly aggressive demands can lead to rejections, so I should aim for slight edges in my favor based on value calculations.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\n\nApplying these principles to my current situation, my resources are: Wheat (22 qty, value 6 each), Wood (8 qty, value 8 each), Sheep (17 qty, value 15 each), Brick (11 qty, value 28 each), and Ore (9 qty, value 37 each). I have an abundance of Wheat, which has the lowest value, making it ideal for trading. From the negotiation history, Player 1 has accepted Wheat-based trades for Brick or Ore, so I can leverage that. However, I must ensure net value gain: for example, trading 4 Wheat (4 * 6 = 24 value) for 1 Brick (28 value) results in a net gain of +4 value, which aligns with value-based decision-making and my goal to increase total value.\n\nGiven that Player 1 previously accepted a similar Wheat-for-Brick trade, I'll propose this offer to capitalize on the pattern while minimizing risk. This move also adheres to the turn limit by keeping things efficient.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
