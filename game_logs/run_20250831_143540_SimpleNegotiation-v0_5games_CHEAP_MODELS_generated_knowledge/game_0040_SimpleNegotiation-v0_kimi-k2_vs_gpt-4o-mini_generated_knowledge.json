      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. Marginal Value Analysis  \n   \u2022 Each resource\u2019s \u201cmarginal\u201d value to me equals the value held divided by the quantity.  \n     \u2013 Wheat: 6 / 5 = 1.2 each  \n     \u2013 Wood: 11 / 18 \u2248 0.61 each  \n     \u2013 Sheep: 15 / 15 = 1.0 each  \n     \u2013 Brick: 21 / 18 \u2248 1.17 each  \n     \u2013 Ore: 39 / 12 = 3.25 each  \n\n2. Surplus & Scarcity Identification  \n   \u2022 Abundant (lowest marginal value): Wood (0.61) and Brick (1.17).  \n   \u2022 Scarce/High-value: Ore (3.25) and Wheat (1.2).  \n   \u2022 Sheep is exactly at an average value (1.0).  \n\n3. Opportunity-Cost Principle  \n   \u2022 To maximize total value, trade away the resources with the lowest marginal value and acquire those with the highest marginal value.  \n\n4. Negotiation Tactics  \n   \u2022 Always make the first offer appear favourable to the other party while still increasing your own total value.  \n   \u2022 Include a \u201cfiller\u201d or \u201cslack\u201d item to keep the overall number of items exchanged equal (common psychological tactic).  \n   \u2022 Hide your true priorities by bundling high-value targets (Ore) with lower-value ones (Sheep).  \n\n5. Quantity Bundling Insight  \n   \u2022 Holding 12 Ore, only 2 Ore can be afforded to lose before dropping below 10 (the first drop where marginal value adjusts downward). Two Ore are worth 2 \u00d7 3.25 = 6.5 value.  \n\nApply the Knowledge:\nI can profitably trade away 3 Sheep and 2 Ore (total value = 3 \u00d7 1 + 2 \u00d7 3.25 = 9.5) for Brick, which is valued to me at 1.17 per piece. Requesting 9 Brick would be an even-value swap, but looks unappetizing. By trimming my request to 5 Brick (value 5 \u00d7 1.17 = 5.85) and requesting 2 Sheep back as a \u201cfiller\u201d (2 \u00d7 1 = 2.0 value), the bundle gives me:  \n   \u2013 total gain to me: 5.85 + 2 \u2212 9.5 = \u22121.65, which is even worse.  \nThe filler idea does not help.\n\nHowever, I really only need the Brick. Requesting 8 Brick straight gives me 9.36 value for 9.5, neutral but not clearly profitable. A cleaner and more persuasive offer is simply 3 Sheep + 2 Ore \u2192 8 Brick. Net change in my total value: \u22129.5 + 9.36 \u2248 0 (approximately break-even). From a pure-maximization standpoint, break-even isn\u2019t enough.\n\nThe only certain profitable exchange is giving low-value Wood instead of Ore. Yet I might need an over-valued package that highlights Ore\u2019s high value to others. Recognize that other players likely value Ore highly; therefore they will demand a premium to give it up. Conversely, I value Brick low, so bricks can be picked up cheaply from players who value Brick even lower.\n\nThus refine the offer algorithmically: I should OFFER 3 Sheep (marginal 1 each) and 2 Ore (marginal 3.25 each) only if I receive \u22658 Brick, which improves my value equation by: 8\u00d71.17 \u2212 (3\u00d71+2\u00d73.25) = 9.36 \u2212 9.5 = \u22120.14 (still no good). I cannot design a 1:1 trade in Brick that yields a gain because my own marginal value of Brick is too close to the value I\u2019d be giving up.\n\nConclusion: it is wiser right now NOT to make a direct offer until I can target players with very low Brick valuations, OR target players holding high-value resources such as Wheat/Ore who value Brick more than their own high-value stuff. Sending no offer is technically a \u201cDeny\u201d by default, but per rules I still must consider an actual outgoing offer.\n\nTherefore I will open negotiations modestly, giving away clear surplus (Wood) to fetch Ore/Wheat. Construct the cheapest offer that still signals generosity:\n\nOffer: give away 5 Wood (value 5 \u00d7 0.61 = 3.05) request 1 Ore (value 3.25). It\u2019s a net value gain of +0.2 for me, and for any player holding Ore with <3.25 marginal value (likely) it looks attractive. That is legitimate profit even if small.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

Prioritize trades that provide higher overall value.\n  \n2. **Scarcity and Demand**: Recognize which resources may be scarce or highly sought after in the trading environment. This can influence trade negotiations positively or negatively.\n\n3. **Leverage Your Strengths**: Use abundant resources to trade for rarer or more valuable ones. Your focus should be on maximizing gains rather than merely exchanging resources.\n\n4. **Incremental Gains**: Look for trades that may seem like a loss initially but can open possibilities for bigger trades in the future, leading to an overall increase in value.\n\n5. **Minimize Rejects & Build Alliances**: Frequent rejections can lead to a stalemate; consider modifying offers to find common ground and build rapport with other players.\n\n6. **Keep a Balanced Portfolio**: Avoid focusing solely on one type of resource unless you can significantly capitalize on it. Diversifying your resources can provide more trading options.\n\n### Trading Decision:\nGiven the situation, Player 1 has reserves of valuable resources (especially Ore and Brick). Player 0's previous offers indicated interest in Brick and Ore, both valuable resources.\n\nThus, I'll send an offer aimed at acquiring additional Brick, as it seems to be a popular request. \n\n**Making an Offer:**\n- Since Player 0 is showing interest in Brick, I can offer some of my Wood (which I have in surplus) along with Sheep in exchange for Brick. This balances my need for Brick while using less valuable resources I have in abundance.\n\n**Final Offer:**\n```\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 5 Brick]\n```",

      "response": "**Knowledge Generation:**\n\n1. **Understanding Resource Value**: Each resource has a specific value, and its utility may vary depending on the goals of both players. Maximizing value means trading resources that yield higher overall worth while taking into account future needs.\n\n2. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: Being aware of the quantities that players have can influence trading decisions. If a resource is over-supplied, its value may drop; if in demand, its value increases.\n\n3. **Win-Win Negotiation**: Finding trades where both players feel they gain value can facilitate smoother negotiations. Offering balanced trades can improve trust and encourage future collaborations.\n\n4. **Strategic Resource Use**: Prioritize using high-value resources efficiently. If a resource has high value (like Ore), it's often worth holding onto unless a very lucrative trade opportunity arises.\n\n5. **Flexibility in Offerings**: Being open to negotiations that include various combinations of resources can yield mutually beneficial results. Tailoring offers based on other players' needs can secure better trades.\n\n**Trading Decision:**\n\nGiven Player 0's recent offers and their rejections, it's clear they may be in need of Brick, and since I have a surplus of Sheep and some Wood, I should focus my efforts on maximizing my gains through these resources.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge \u2013 Key principles relevant right now\n\n1. Value-capture vs. value-dilution  \n   \u2013 The unit value of Brick is the highest single-unit value in my hand (21) and ties are Ore (39 / 12 = 3.25 per unit), Brick (21) Sheep (15) Wood (11) Wheat low (1.2).  \n   \u2013 Therefore every unit I lose or gain must be judged by \u201cwhat am I giving up, what am I receiving\u201d, scaled by their unit values.\n\n2. Concession curve & reciprocity  \n   \u2013 Both players have rejected almost every offer so far; Player 1 keeps paring back the same demand (5 Brick) by one unit of Wood each time. I\u2019ve parried by slightly smaller counter-offers.  \n   \u2013 If a compromise improves my total value and saves the remaining turns, it is rational even if it is far from my originally preferred ratio.\n\n3. Scarcity & surplus  \n   \u2013 I own 18 Brick, the most abundant single stock I control. I have very large surpluses of Wood (18) and Brick (18) but startlingly large Ore gap (only 12).  \n   \u2013 Because Brick has the highest conversion value (21), I want to avoid bleeding Brick for low-value returns. Yet I already have an undeniable surplus.\n\n4. Marginal utility & end-game timing  \n   \u2013 We are past mid-game. Every future turn is now an opportunity cost (denial of paired offer slot). Refusing every deal risks total stasis (= zero net gain).  \n   \u2013 Accepting a deal that yields zero or positive net value dominates stasis; capturing just 1 unit of Ore or Brick of high utility outstrips holding an excess I cannot use.\n\nApplying the knowledge\n\nThe current on-table offer is Player 1:  \n3 Sheep + 2 Wood \u2192 5 Brick\n\nInfer unit values from my table:\n\nValue I give up:  \n3 Sheep \u00d7 1  + 2 Wood \u00d7 0.52 \u2248 3 + 1.04 \u2248 4.04 units of value.\n\nValue I receive:  \n5 Brick \u00d7 1.40 \u2248 7 units of value.\n\nNet gain \u2248 +3 units of value, definitely positive.\n\nBrick is my highest-value stock, but I possess far more Brick than I can realistically leverage (18 vs next highest resource). Gaining 5 more Brick activates no immediate synergy because I am already long on it; however giving away 3 Sheep and 2 Wood merely reduces surpluses that contribute little marginal utility.\n\nCrucially, if I reject, the whole round will again end with no movement and I burn another scarce opportunity. Even though I originally wanted to part Brick only for Ore (highest value), Player 1 shows no willingness to trade Ore.\n\nTherefore accepting this offer is a rational concession under diminishing-returns conditions, as long as the net value shifts positively.\n\nDecision:\n\n[Accept]",
