      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\n1. **Value Comparison**: Understand the relative values of your resources. For example, Ore has the highest value while Wheat has the lowest. High-value resources can be traded for larger quantities of lower-value ones, but you must ensure that the trade improves your overall resource value.\n\n2. **Supply and Demand**: Pay attention to what other players might need. If other players are in shortage of certain resources, those resources will be more valuable. You should position yourself strategically to offer what they need.\n\n3. **Negotiation Strategy**: Focus on win-win scenarios. When proposing trades, offer resources that may be less critical to your strategy while securing those that enhance your position.\n\n4. **Diversification**: Avoid concentrating too heavily on one type of resource. Aim for a balanced portfolio that increases your flexibility in future trades.\n\n5. **Leverage**: Use higher-value resources as leverage to request desirable trades. The goal is to maximize your resource value by exchanging high-value resources for multiple lower-value ones or combining them strategically.\n\n6. **Incremental Gains**: Focus on making trades that provide a clear incremental gain in total value. Even small trades may be advantageous when planned over several turns.\n\n### Trading Decision\n\nGiven that I have a diverse set of resources with varying values, my current strategy will involve leveraging the high-value resources (like Ore and Brick) to secure more advantageous trades.\n\nI am considering an initial offer that exchanges some of my surplus Sheep and Ore for a combination of Brick and additional Sheep, as Brick has high value. The total values involved in this trade would yield a better resource mix for future negotiations.\n\nThus, my trading decision will be:\n\n**Trade Proposal**:\n- I will offer 3 Sheep and 2 Ore in exchange for 5 Brick and 2 Sheep.\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]",

Opportunity Cost vs. Direct Value Perspective  \n   - 3 Sheep, 2 Ore (Player 0\u2019s offer) have a combined total value of 3\u00d714 + 2\u00d733 = 108.  \n   - 5 Brick, 2 Sheep (what Player 0 demands) have a combined total value of 5\u00d727 + 2\u00d714 = 163.  \n   By the numbers the exchange is lop-sided: you would give away 163 of value to receive only 108\u2014an immediate net loss of 55 points. In a straight \u201ctotal-value\u201d metric pure arithmetic rejects the trade.\n\n2. Marginal Value vs. Aggregate Value  \n   A single resource\u2019s value may decline if you already have an outsized stock.  \n   - You already own 18 Brick\u2014highest quantity of any resource (only equalled by Sheep). The marginal Brick gained beyond 18 has sharply reduced usefulness/incremental value because your current stock already gives you large flexibility.  \n   - Conversely, you only have 5 Wood\u2014the scarcest resource and the one with the second-highest unit value (12). Because Wood is both valuable and scarce to you, it is the resource whose marginal value is highest.\n\n3. Negotiation Leverage & Counter-Offers  \n   When you face an unfavorable offer, the classic tactic is:  \n   a. Identify what of yours the proposer really wants (in this case, the 5 Brick + 2 Sheep).  \n   b. Redirect the negotiation toward a package that narrows the value gap or flips it in your favor.  \n   c. Offer resources you have in surplus where the marginal value is low, and seek resources you do not possess.\n\nApplying Knowledge:\n\nMy largest surplus relative to its unit value is Brick (18 units, 27 value each), followed by Sheep (14 units, 14 value each).  \nMy most scarce valuable resources are Wood (only 5 units, 12 value each) and Wheat (10 units, 5 value each), but Wood is the critical bottleneck.  \n\nI therefore decline the current offer because it worsens my total value and exacerbates myalready-large Brick surplus. Instead, I formulate a counter-offer that leverages my surplus Brick to relieve my Wood shortage.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\n\n1. **Value Assessment**: Prioritize trading items with lower individual value versus items with higher value to maximize resource value. Knowing the value of your resources enables you to judge the fairness of trades effectively.\n\n2. **Flexibility & Strategy**: Being flexible with the combinations of resources you offer can attract more interest from the other player. Consider how the specific needs of the other player may influence their willingness to trade.\n\n3. **Demand Dynamics**: Keep track of how your trading partner values specific resources. If they are short on a certain item but may be less inclined to trade it, this could shape your offers.\n\n4. **Incremental Gains**: Look for opportunities that yield incremental gains rather than aiming for large trades that could risk acceptance.\n\n5. **Reputation and Future Deals**: Building a reputation as a fair trader can facilitate better trades in the future. Consistently making reasonable offers may lead to better acceptance rates over time.\n\n### Trading Decision\n\nGiven the recent trading activities, Player 1 has shown a tendency to reject offers that do not provide them with enough value, particularly regarding Brick and Ore. Player 0's previous offers have not successfully conveyed value to them, so it may be fruitful to adjust the offer concerning the resources they seem to need.\n\nThe resources I currently have after the most recent trade with Player 1 are:\n- Wheat: 18 (after offering 5)\n- Wood: 4 (after offering 3)\n- Sheep: 6 (after offering 2)\n- Brick: 0 (gained 4)\n- Ore: 4 (after gaining 3)\n\nNotably, I still have resources that hold substantial value. Since Player 1's needs for Brick and Ore are evident, I can leverage this to maximize my resource value.\n\nI will make the following offer:\n\n**Suggested Trade Offer**:  \n[Offer: 4 Wood, 6 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 2 Ore]\n\nThis offer provides Player 1 with the materials that seem to be in demand while allowing me to offload less valuable resources and gain more valuable ones. \n\n### Sending the Offer\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 6 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 2 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. Net-Value Maximization: Compare the total value leaving your hand (negative) with the total value entering your hand (positive); only proceed if net change >0.  \n   Value per unit: Wheat 5, Wood 12, Sheep 14, Brick 27, Ore 33.\n\n2. Resource Scarcity Principle: Ore and Brick have the highest unit values (33 and 27). Every extra one you gain adds more total value than every other unit you can acquire. Trading these away should always require premium compensation.\n\n3. Marginal Utility: Because I already hold an above-average quantity of Sheep (14) and Brick (18), decreasing them slightly hurts me less on a per-unit basis, provided the incoming goods are higher-value and useful late-game.\n\n4. Counter-offer Tactic: Instead of simply rejecting a tilted offer, immediately table a new proposal that corrects the imbalance but still appears reasonable.\n\nApply knowledge to the current proposal:\nCurrent offer from Player 0 \u2192 \u201c4 Wood, 6 Wheat for 3 Brick, 2 Ore\u201d\n- Value leaving me: 3\u00b727 + 2\u00b733 = 81 + 66 = 147  \n- Value entering me: 4\u00b712 + 6\u00b75 = 48 + 30 = 78  \nNet loss = 78 \u2013 147 = \u201369 \u2192 clearly negative, must reject.  \n\nNow build a counter-offer that uses Player 0\u2019s apparent appetite for Brick and Ore while keeping the deal within the limits of what I can spare (after all previous adjustments) and netting myself surplus value.\n\nMy current quantities after turn 8:  \n- Brick decreased by 4 (to 14) and Ore decreased by 3 (to 14) from the trade I accepted, no other changes.  \nTherefore:  \nWheat: 10 \u2192 15 (after +5 from the accepted trade)  \nWood: 5 \u2192 7 (after +3)  \nSheep: 14 \u2192 15 (after +2)  \nBrick: 18 \u2192 14  \nOre: 17 \u2192 14  \n\nValuable trade would give me more high-value Brick/Ore while off-loading surplus lower-value Wheat/Wood. But Player 0 is offering Wood/Wheat in return\u2014all low value. Instead, reverse the direction: Offer up surplus Sheep (14\u219215 after recent trade) which they have taken before and get back premium goods.\n\nExpert counter-proposal:\n- Make package SMALL so it feels attainable to partner.  \n- Target 1-for-1 ratio where I trade outward lower value units for inward higher value units, achieving a net value gain; since Sheep is valued at 14 and Brick at 27, a 1:2 ratio favors me but 1:1 is already gainful if I give Sheep.\n\nSimplest deal:\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nNet value change: +33 - 14 = +19.\n\nIt is clean, direct, and leverages my current surplus while adding the most precious commodity.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
