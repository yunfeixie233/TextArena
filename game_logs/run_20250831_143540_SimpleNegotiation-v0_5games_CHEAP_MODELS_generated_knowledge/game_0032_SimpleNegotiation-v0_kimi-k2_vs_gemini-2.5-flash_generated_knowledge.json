      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. Value Density & Marginal Utility  \n   - The value per unit of each resource is:  \n     Wheat 6, Wood 8, Sheep 18, Brick 29, Ore 38.  \n   - Ore is the most valuable per unit, followed by Brick.  \n   - I have 24 Ore and 10 Brick, so the marginal utility of an extra Ore or Brick is lower than for someone who has very few.  \n   - Conversely, I have only 6 Wood and 6 Sheep, so the marginal utility of Wood and Sheep is high for me.  \n   - Therefore, I should be willing to give up Ore or Brick only if I receive a large quantity of Wood or Sheep in return.\n\n2. Portfolio Balance & Risk  \n   - My portfolio is heavily skewed toward high-value resources (Ore, Brick) and low-value Wheat.  \n   - A balanced portfolio reduces risk if the game later rewards diversity or if other players suddenly value Wheat more.  \n   - I can afford to trade away some Ore or Brick because I have plenty, but I should avoid trading away so much that I become short of any one resource.\n\n3. Negotiation Leverage  \n   - Because Ore and Brick are scarce for most players, I have strong leverage.  \n   - I should look for players who are short on Ore or Brick and willing to overpay in Wood or Sheep.  \n   - I should avoid trading with players who already have a lot of Ore/Brick, because they will not value it highly.\n\n4. Offer Structure  \n   - A good offer gives me more total value than I give away.  \n   - Example: If I give 3 Ore (3\u00d738 = 114 value) and receive 5 Wood (5\u00d78 = 40 value), that is a loss.  \n   - Instead, I should aim to give low-value Wheat or small amounts of high-value resources in exchange for large quantities of Wood or Sheep.\n\n5. Timing & Turn Count  \n   - The game lasts 10 turns. Early trades can compound if I reinvest wisely.  \n   - I should not hoard resources that are unlikely to appreciate; instead, convert excess high-value resources into scarce mid-value resources (Wood, Sheep) that I lack.\n\nApplying the Knowledge:\n\nI currently lack Wood and Sheep. I have excess Ore and Brick.  \nI will look for an offer that lets me trade 2\u20133 Ore or 1\u20132 Brick for at least 4\u20135 Wood or 3\u20134 Sheep, ensuring a net gain in total portfolio value.\n\nSince no incoming offer is visible yet, I will make an opening offer that leverages my surplus Ore and Brick to acquire scarce Wood and Sheep.\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore, 1 Brick -> 4 Wood, 2 Sheep]",

This means I should aim to trade away resources I value less for resources I value more, or trade away resources for which I have a surplus if the trade is favorable.\n*   **Current Offer Analysis:** Player 0 is offering 2 Ore (Value: 37/unit) and 1 Brick (Value: 27/unit) for 4 Wood (Value: 8/unit) and 2 Sheep (Value: 17/unit).\n    *   Value of incoming offer (2 Ore + 1 Brick): (2 * 37) + (1 * 27) = 74 + 27 = 101\n    *   Value of resources Player 0 wants (4 Wood + 2 Sheep): (4 * 8) + (2 * 17) = 32 + 34 = 66\n    *   From a purely value-based perspective, accepting this offer would mean giving away 66 value for 101 value, which is a net gain of 35.

While Ore is my most valuable per unit, having a surplus might make me more willing to trade it if the return is sufficiently high in other valuable resources, or if it helps consolidate my inventory.\n*   **Negotiation Flexibility:** Since this is a negotiation game, I don't always have to accept or deny. I can make counter-offers. However, the current offer is very good for me.\n*   **Turn Limit:** 10 turns. Every turn is an opportunity to increase value.

Diminishing & Increasing Returns \u2013 Brick and Ore are in the zone where extra units still keep their high value, so \u201cthinning\u201d them just a couple of units is low risk. Conversely, Wood (8) and Sheep (18) have values that increase rapidly; the first extra Wood/Sheep I currently own could gain a lot.  \n3.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: What key principles, strategies, or insights about resource trading and negotiation are most relevant to your current situation?\n\n*   **Understand Resource Values:** My primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I need to understand the relative values of each resource. Ore (37) and Brick (27) are my most valuable, followed by Sheep (17), Wood (8), and Wheat (6).\n*   **Identify Surplus and Deficit:** I have a significant quantity of Ore (12) and a decent amount of Wheat (6), Wood (6), and Sheep (6). Brick (5) is my lowest quantity. This suggests I might want to acquire more Brick, and I have high-value resources (Ore, Sheep) or less-valuable resources (Wheat, Wood) to trade.\n*   **Calculate Trade Profitability:** For any potential trade, I must calculate the total value of resources I'm offering versus the total value of resources I'm requesting. I should only make trades where `Value(Requested Resources) > Value(Offered Resources)`.\n*   **Player 0's Previous Behavior:**\n    *   Player 0 previously offered `2 Ore (74), 1 Brick (27) -> 4 Wood (32), 2 Sheep (34)`. Total offer value: 101. Total request value: 66. This was a *terrible* offer for Player 0, and I accepted it. This suggests Player 0 might not be accurately valuing resources or is desperate for certain types.\n    *   Player 0 then offered `3 Sheep (51), 2 Ore (74) -> 5 Brick (135), 2 Sheep (34)`. Total offer value: 125. Total request value: 169. This was a good offer for Player 0 (they gained 44 value), but I rejected it. Why? Likely because I valued my Ore too highly at the time, or didn't want to lose that much Ore even for Brick. Re-evaluating, while I exchanged high-value resources, I would have *gained* value. This was a mistake on my part not to accept.\n    *   My last offer was `2 Wood (16), 2 Wheat (12) -> 2 Sheep (34)`. Total offer value: 28. Total request value: 34. This was a good offer for me (gain of 6 value), but Player 0 rejected it. This indicates Player 0 might not want to trade Sheep for low-value resources, or they specifically need Wood/Wheat.\n*   **Negotiation Strategy:**\n    *   **Propose value-positive trades:** Always ensure my side of the trade gains value.\n    *   **Consider opponent's needs/offers:** Player 0's previous offers and rejections indicate they might be seeking Wood, Sheep, or are willing to give up Brick for high-value resources.\n    *   **Leverage high-value resources:** I have 12 Ore. This is a very powerful bargaining chip. I can use it to acquire scarce (for me) or high-value resources like Brick.\n    *   **Avoid giving too much value:** While seeking profit, don't give away an excessive amount of high-value resources for a small gain, especially if those high-value resources are scarce for me (like Brick already is).\n    *   **Openness to different types of trades:** Be flexible. I can exchange low-value for high-value, or high-value for even higher-value.\n    *   **Current Goal:** I want more Brick. I also have a lot of Ore.\n\nCurrent Resources and Values:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 6 Value: 6 (Total: 36)\n*   [Wood] Qty: 6 Value: 8 (Total: 48)\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 6 Value: 17 (Total: 102)\n*   [Brick] Qty: 5 Value: 27 (Total: 135)\n*   [Ore] Qty: 12 Value: 37 (Total: 444)\nTotal Value: 765\n\nPlayer 0 made no new trade offer.\n\nDecision: I need to initiate a trade. I want Brick. I have a lot of Ore and a decent amount of low-value resources.\n\nRevisiting Player 0's second offer: `3 Sheep (51), 2 Ore (74) -> 5 Brick (135), 2 Sheep (34)`. My proposed gain: (135+34) - (51+74) = 169 - 125 = +44 Value. This was an excellent offer for me, and I regret rejecting it. It shows Player 0 is willing to give up Brick (my target) for Ore and Sheep.\n\nI have 12 Ore. I can afford to part with some. I also have 6 Sheep.\nI want Brick. I have 5. I want to increase this.\n\nLet's try to get Brick using Ore, as Player 0 seems willing to trade Brick for Ore.\nWhat if I offer Ore for Brick?\n\nOption 1: Offer Ore for Brick.\n`1 Ore (37) -> 1 Brick (27)` - No, this is a loss for me.\n`1 Ore (37) -> 2 Brick (54)` - This is a good gain (+17). Player 0 might not accept giving 2 Brick for 1 Ore.\n\nLet's consider Player 0's past offers. They were willing to give `5 Brick` for `2 Ore, 3 Sheep`.\n5 Brick value: 135.\n2 Ore value: 74. 3 Sheep value: 51.\nTotal given by P0: 169 (5 Brick + 2 Sheep). Total received by P0: 125 (3 Sheep + 2 Ore). P0 gains 44.\n\nI need to propose a trade that is favorable to me, but also potentially attractive to Player 0.\nPlayer 0 rejected my `2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 2 Sheep` offer. They might not want to trade Sheep unless it's a significant gain for them.\n\nLet's try to get Brick using my Ore, as it's my highest quantity and highest value.\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore for multiple Brick?\n`[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]` Value Offered: 37. Value Requested: 54. Profit for me: +17. This is a very good profit if accepted. However, player 0 might think 1 Ore is too little for 2 Brick.\n\nGiven my regret over the previous rejection, I need to be more aggressive in acquiring Brick even if it means parting with Ore.\nLet's try to get more Brick using a combination of Ore and perhaps some lower value resources.\nWhat if I offer 2 Ore for 3 or 4 Brick?\n`[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick]` Offered: 74. Requested: 81. Profit: +7. Decent.\n`[Offer: 2 Ore -> 4 Brick]` Offered: 74. Requested: 108. Profit: +34. Excellent.\n\nGiven Player 0 appears willing to trade Brick for Ore, let's make an offer for Brick. I have 12 Ore, so I can spare 2 readily.\nI want to make a substantial gain.\nI will offer 2 Ore for 4 Brick. This is a significant gain for me (+34 value). Player 0 might accept if they value Ore highly or are low on Ore.\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 4 Brick]",

This also shows P0 is willing to give up high-value resources. *Correction: Player 1 accepted, meaning Player 1 gave 2 Ore and 1 Brick, and received 4 Wood and 2 Sheep. So, P1 gave up 101 value and gained 66 value, resulting in a net loss of 35. This trade was BAD for me (Player 1).*\n        *   *Self-correction: My previous P1 acceptance was a mistake or miscalculation based on the provided text. Let's re-read: \"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 2 Ore, 1 Brick -> Requested items: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep. Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\" This means P0 *offered* (gave to) 2 Ore and 1 Brick, and P0 *requested* (took from) 4 Wood and 2 Sheep. The syntax is [Offered items: X -> Requested items: Y], where X is what the proposer *gives* and Y is what the proposer *wants*. This implies P1 received 2 Ore and 1 Brick, and gave 4 Wood and 2 Sheep.\n            *   Value P1 Received: 2 Ore (74) + 1 Brick (27) = 101\n            *   Value P1 Gave: 4 Wood (32) + 2 Sheep (34) = 66\n            *   Net change for P1: +101 - 66 = +35.

P0 perceived the Wood/Wheat as less valuable than the Sheep, or simply didn't need Sheep that much. P0's rejection means they didn't see enough value in 2 Wood, 2 Wheat for their 2 Sheep.\n\n    *   **P1's Accepted Offer (P0 accepted):** Offered: 1 Ore (37) -> Requested: 2 Brick (54).\n        *   Value P1 offered to P0: 37\n        *   Value P1 requested from P0: 54\n        *   This trade was great for P1 (gain 54, give 37, net +17). This indicates P0 may have had an excess of Brick or a high demand for Ore. This is an important insight: P0 is willing to trade Brick for Ore at a beneficial rate to me (1 Ore for 2 Brick).\n\n5.  **Identify P0's Preferences/Needs (Inferred):**\n    *   P0 values Wood/Sheep more than their intrinsic value (from the first accepted trade).\n    *   P0 wants Brick (from the rejected offer where they asked for 5 Brick).\n    *   P0 is willing to give Brick for Ore (from the last accepted trade). This suggests P0 might be Brick-rich or Ore-poor.\n\n6.  **Strategic Goals for Player 1:**\n    *   Increase total resource value.\n    *   Acquire more high-value resources: Brick (27), Ore (37), Sheep (17) in that order.\n    *   Trade away low-value resources: Wheat (6), Wood (8).\n    *   Capitalize on P0's apparent willingness to trade Brick for Ore at a good rate for P1.\n    *   Capitalize on P0's apparent demand for Wood/Sheep, but be careful not to overpay.\n\n7.  **Consider New Offers:**\n    *   Focus on what P0 accepted: giving Brick for Ore. Can I get more Brick for my Ore?\n    *   P0 just accepted 1 Ore for 2 Brick. This is a very favorable rate for me. I have 12 Ore. If I can repeat this, it's excellent.\n    *   What about trading away more Wheat/Wood for higher value resources? P0 rejected 2W, 2Wt for 2S (value 28 for 34). Maybe the ratio was too close for P0, or they didn't need Sheep.\n\n8.  **Formulate an Offer:**\n    *   The previous successful trade was 1 Ore (37) -> 2 Brick (54). This is a good exchange. I have 12 Ore, they accepted it once. Let's try to get more Brick.\n    *   What if I try a slightly less beneficial trade for me, but still positive, that P0 might be more inclined to accept if they need Ore? Maybe 2 Ore for 3 Brick? (Value 74 for 81. Net +7 for P1).\n    *   Or, what if I try to push the successful one a bit, 2 Ore for 4 Brick? (Value 74 for 108. Net +34 for P1). Given P0 accepted 1 Ore for 2 Brick, this is logically the same ratio. It tests if P0 has a larger quantity of Brick they are willing to part with for Ore.\n\nGiven the goal to increase total value, and the prior successful trade, repeating a proven beneficial exchange or scaling it up seems like the safest and most efficient strategy. P0 showed a willingness to trade Brick for Ore at 1:2.\n\nMy current resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 6    Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 6    Value: 8\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 6    Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 5    Value: 27\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 12   Value: 37\n\nLast trade: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick (P1 gave 37, P1 received 54, net +17 for P1).\nI have plenty of Ore (12).

Given Player 0's acceptance of 1 Ore for 2 Brick, they might be open to similar trades involving Ore.\n10. **Resource Balance:** While valuing specific resources, also consider maintaining a reasonable quantity of all resources for future flexibility. I'm low on Wood (2) now.\n\nMy current resources: Wheat:6, Wood:2, Sheep:4, Brick:8, Ore:13.\nMy highest value resources are Ore and Brick. My lowest are Wood and Wheat. I have ample Ore and Brick. I am low on Wood.\n\nNow, consider P0's *current* lack of offer. This means I make the first move.\n\nI need to make an offer that increases my total value.\nConsidering my low Wood quantity, getting Wood might be desirable if I can get it for less valuable resources. However, my main goal is value, not just quantity. Wood is low value.\n\nLet's try to offload some Wheat or Sheep, possibly gaining even more Brick or Ore if possible.\nOr, I could try to get more Wood or Sheep for my abundant Ore if the ratio is very favorable.\nI have a significant amount of Ore (13) and Brick (8).\n\nLet's look for combinations that give me more value than I give.\n*   Trade less valuable for more valuable: Wheat (6), Wood (8).\n*   Trade high value for even higher value: e.g., 1 Ore (37) for 3 Sheep (51) or 2 Brick (54). (Already did 1 Ore -> 2 Brick successfully).\n*   Trade multiple low value for one high value: e.g., 2 Wheat (12) + 1 Wood (8) = 20 -> 1 Sheep (17) (loss) / 1 Brick (27) (gain).\n\nI have a lot of Ore and a decent amount of Brick. I have very little Wood.\nPlayer 0 accepted 1 Ore -> 2 Brick before. Maybe they still need Brick?\n\nIf I offer Wheat/Wood for Sheep/Brick/Ore, I should ensure positive value.\nWhat if I offer a resource that I have in abundance (Sheep: 4, Wheat:6, Ore:13, Brick:8) for something that I need or offers more value?\n\nLet's try to get more of the high-value resources (Brick, Ore) by giving up less valuable ones (Wheat, Wood, Sheep).\nI have 6 Wheat (6), 2 Wood (8), 4 Sheep (17), 8 Brick (27), 13 Ore (37).\n\nPossible favorable trades (value gained > value offered):\n1.  **Offering Wheat/Wood for Sheep/Brick/Ore:**\n    *   2 Wheat (12) -> 1 Sheep (17) -> +5 value. (Player 0 rejected 2W, 2Wt -> 2S before; maybe too much low value on my side).\n    *   1 Wood (8) -> 1 Sheep (17) -> +9 value. (I'm low on Wood already, but if it helps value...)\n    *   3 Wheat (18) -> 1 Brick (27) -> +9 value. (Player 0 might not want 3 Wheat).\n    *   1 Wheat (6) + 1 Wood (8) = 14 -> 1 Sheep (17) -> +3 value.\n    *   This might be too stingy for Player 0 given their previous trade with me (giving me a big net gain).\n\n2.  **Offering Sheep/Brick/Ore for *more* value (e.g. going up the value chain):**\n    *   1 Sheep (17) -> 1 Brick (27) -> +10 value. This feels reasonable. I have 4 Sheep.\n    *   1 Sheep (17) -> 1 Ore (37) -> +20 value. Unlikely P0 would accept unless desperate for Sheep.\n    *   1 Brick (27) -> 1 Ore (37) -> +10 value. I have 8 Brick, 13 Ore, so this exchanges a moderately high value for the highest value. But P0 accepted 1 Ore -> 2 Brick from me (meaning they valued Brick more or needed it more). So this current direction (Brick for Ore) might be harder.\n\nLet's try a trade that builds on the last accepted one (1 Ore -> 2 Brick).\nI could try to get more Brick for slightly less Ore if Player 0 truly values Brick. For instance, 1 Ore (37) for 2 Brick (54) was accepted and great for me.\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep and 1 Wood (17+8=25) for 1 Brick (27)? This is a small gain (+2) for me and offloads Sheep/Wood.\nOr, 2 Sheep (34) for 2 Brick (54)? This is a +20 gain! I have 4 Sheep. This sounds promising.\n\nLet's try to increase my Brick count, as it's a good intermediate value, and Player 0 seemed open to giving Brick.\nMy current Wood is 2. I should be careful not to make it 0 unless I get something fantastic.\n\nLet's make an offer.\nMy current values: W:6, Wo:2, S:4, B:8, O:13. Total: 817.\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick\n*   Value Offered: 2 * 17 = 34\n*   Value Requested: 2 * 27 = 54\n*   Net Gain: +20. This is a very good gain. I have 4 Sheep, so I can afford to lose 2. I have 8 Brick, so gaining 2 is good.\n\nThis seems like a balanced, yet beneficial offer. Player 0 rejected \"3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\" before. That was a bad deal for me. My offer is much simpler and more favorable to me.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value-based Trading:** The primary goal is to increase the *total value* of my resources. This means evaluating the value of what I give up versus the value of what I gain.\n2.  **Scarcity and Demand:** Resources with higher individual values (Ore, Brick, Sheep) are likely more sought after. I should be cautious about trading away highly valued resources unless the return is significantly better. Conversely, I should try to trade away lower-valued resources (Wheat, Wood) for higher-valued ones.\n3.  **Marginal Value:** Consider not just the *per unit* value but also how acquiring more of a specific resource might push me closer to a production goal, even if its per-unit value isn't the absolute highest. For this game, the value is explicitly given, so I rely on that.\n4.  **Player 0's Behavior:** Player 0 has rejected offers that did not seem immediately beneficial to them (e.g., losing Sheep for Brick, even if the value was higher for me). They also accepted an offer where they gained 2 Brick (value 54) for 1 Ore (value 37), which was a net gain for them of 17. They previously accepted my offer of 1 Ore (37) for 2 Brick (54) - a good deal for me. This suggests they are open to trades that benefit them, even if it benefits me more.\n5.  **Inventory Analysis:**\n    *   **High Value (per unit):** Ore (37), Brick (27), Sheep (17)\n    *   **Medium Value:** Wood (8)\n    *   **Low Value:** Wheat (6)\n    *   I have a large quantity of Ore (12) which is my most valuable resource. This makes it a good resource to trade from, but only if I get something *significantly* more valuable in return, or if I trade small quantities.\n    *   I have a moderate quantity of Sheep (6) and Wood (6).\n    *   I have a low quantity of Brick (5) and Wheat (6).\n    *   My Brick quantity is relatively low but highly valuable. Acquiring more Brick would be good.\n6.  **Past Trades Analysis:**\n    *   I accepted an offer from P0: 2 Ore (74), 1 Brick (27) -> 4 Wood (32), 2 Sheep (34). Total value lost: 101. Total value gained: 66. This was a *terrible* trade for me. I should be more careful.\n    *   I rejected P0's offer: 3 Sheep (51), 2 Ore (74) -> 5 Brick (135), 2 Sheep (34). Value lost: 125. Value gained: 169. This was a *good* trade for me, I should have accepted it! My previous reasoning for rejection must have been flawed, maybe I miscalculated. This highlights the importance of accurate value calculation.\n    *   I offered: 2 Wood (16), 2 Wheat (12) -> 2 Sheep (34). Value lost: 28. Value gained: 34. This was a good offer for me (+6), but P0 rejected it. This suggests P0 might also be valuing Sheep highly or not needing Wood/Wheat enough.\n    *   I offered: 1 Ore (37) -> 2 Brick (54). P0 accepted. This was a great trade for me (+17). It shows P0 is willing to give up Brick for Ore if the gain is positive for them.\n    *   I offered: 2 Sheep (34) -> 2 Brick (54). P0 rejected. This was a good trade for me (+20). This again suggests P0 values Sheep highly or doesn't want to lose Brick for it at that rate.\n\n7.  **Current Objective:** Increase total value. My last successful trade was trading Ore for Brick at a very favorable rate. I should look for similar opportunities. I need more Brick. Player 0 seems willing to give up Brick.\n\n8.  **Strategy for next turn:**\n    *   My inventory: Wheat 6 (36), Wood 6 (48), Sheep 6 (102), Brick 7 (189), Ore 11 (407). Total Value: 782.\n    *   Previous state: Wheat 6 (36), Wood 6 (48), Sheep 6 (102), Brick 5 (135), Ore 12 (444). Total Value: 765.\n    *   My total value *increased* from 765 to 782 due to my last trade. I need to continue this.\n    *   Given Player 0 rejected 2 Sheep for 2 Brick, they seem unwilling to part with Brick for Sheep, or value Sheep highly.\n    *   Given Player 0 *accepted* 1 Ore for 2 Brick, they are willing to part with Brick for Ore, likely because 1 Ore (37) is less than 2 Brick (54) for me, but perhaps valuable for them.\n    *   I still have a good amount of Ore. I want more Brick.\n    *   Perhaps I can offer low-value resources for high-value resources, but P0 already rejected 2 Wood, 2 Wheat for 2 Sheep.\n    *   I will try to get more Brick. My last successful trade was 1 Ore for 2 Brick. Perhaps I can try to exploit that further, but I need to be careful not to deplete my Ore too much, or offer a trade that is too beneficial for P0.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the trade I rejected (3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep).\nOffered: 3 Sheep = 51, 2 Ore = 74. Total value lost = 125.\nRequested: 5 Brick = 135, 2 Sheep = 34. Total value gained = 169.\nNet gain for me = 169 - 125 = 44. This was a *very good* trade for me, and I critically miscalculated or misunderstood it earlier. This highlights the need to be systematic. I must correctly evaluate.\n\nMy current high quantity of Ore (11) makes it a good resource to trade from for higher value.\nI have a decent supply of Wood and Wheat, which are low value, making them good candidates to offer.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick.\nOption 1: Try for a smaller version of the favorable Ore for Brick trade.\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick] (Value lost: 37, Value gained: 54. Net gain: 17 for me). P0 accepted this before. This depletes my high-value Ore but significantly increases my even higher-value Brick. I have 11 Ore, so I can afford to trade some.\n\nOption 2: Try to trade low-value for high-value.\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 2 Sheep] (Value lost: 16+12=28, Value gained: 34. Net gain: 6 for me). P0 rejected this before. Unlikely to work unless P0's needs changed.\n\nOption 3: Try to trade for Brick using something other than Ore.\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick] (Value lost: 34, Value gained: 54. Net gain: 20 for me). P0 rejected this.\n\nGiven P0 accepted 1 Ore for 2 Brick, and I have 11 Ore, repeating this trade is a strong possibility. It consistently increases my value.\nI also want to avoid past mistakes of rejecting good offers.\nMy inventory: Wheat 6, Wood 6, Sheep 6, Brick 7, Ore 11.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick using Ore, as it worked before. The net gain for me is 17. This is solid.\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]",
