      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade I make should result in a higher net worth after the exchange.\n2. **Scarcity and Demand:** Resources I have in high quantities, especially those with lower individual value, are good candidates for trading away to acquire more valuable or scarcer resources. Conversely, I should seek to acquire resources that I have less of, or those with high individual value.\n3. **Marginal Utility/Value:** While a resource has a set value, its marginal utility to me might decrease as I accumulate more of it. I have a large quantity of Brick (25) and Ore (23), which are currently my highest valued individual resources. This means I might be willing to trade some away if I can get a good return, as continued accumulation might not be the most efficient strategy for total value growth. Wheat, with 13 units and the lowest value, is a prime candidate for trading away. Wood and Sheep are in moderate quantities.\n4. **Strategic Reserves:** While trading, I shouldn't deplete a resource entirely, especially if it has a high individual value or if it's a versatile resource. Maintaining some reserves for future, potentially more favorable trades or internal use (if applicable in another game context) is wise.\n5. **Understanding Opponent's Needs (Implicit):** While I don't know the opponent's inventory, a good negotiation aims for win-win scenarios that benefit both parties. My offers should ideally be attractive enough for the opponent to consider.\n6. **Offer Structure:** I need to make an offer. A good offer involves giving up something I value less (or have in abundance) for something I value more (or need). I have an abundance of Brick and Ore, my highest value items, and a lot of Sheep. Wheat is my lowest value and I also have a decent quantity.\n7. **Iterative Negotiation:** This is Turn 1. If an offer isn't accepted, I can adjust my strategy in future turns. I should start with a reasonable offer, not necessarily my absolute best.\n\nTrading Decision:\n\nCurrent total value: (13 * 5) + (5 * 12) + (24 * 14) + (25 * 29) + (23 * 33) = 65 + 60 + 336 + 725 + 759 = 1945\n\nI have significant quantities of Brick (25) and Ore (23), which are my highest value resources. Wheat (13) is my lowest value resource. Sheep (24) is something I have a lot of too, with a moderate value.\n\nI want to increase my total value. A good strategy would be to trade away resources I have in abundance for resources I have less of, or for a favorable exchange rate for resources I value more.\n\nLet's consider trading out some Wheat, which is my lowest value resource. However, it's hard to make a significant value increase trading wheat without giving up a lot.\n\nA potential strategy is to convert some high-quantity, high-value resources (Brick, Ore, Sheep) into other high-value resources, especially if I can get a good return or diversify my portfolio.\n\nLet's try to offload some of my high-quantity, medium-value resource, Sheep, for something with a higher individual value like Ore, or even more high-value Brick.\n\nMy highest value resources are Brick (29) and Ore (33). I have 25 Brick and 23 Ore.\nI have 24 Sheep (14), 13 Wheat (5), 5 Wood (12).\n\nConsider an offer: I give some of my abundant, moderate value Sheep and maybe some Wheat/Wood for higher value resources like Brick or Ore, or even for other Sheep if the ratio is favorable.\n\nLet's aim to trade away some Sheep, which I have a lot of, and perhaps some Wheat. I am looking for more Ore or Brick if the ratio is favorable.\n\nIf I offer, say, 5 Sheep (5 * 14 = 70 value) and 3 Wheat (3 * 5 = 15 value) for 3 Ore (3 * 33 = 99 value).\nNet value change: 99 - (70 + 15) = 99 - 85 = +14. This is a positive gain.\n\nLet's try a simpler offer with my most abundant items. I have 25 Brick. If I trade some Brick for Ore, it has to be a good ratio because Ore is slightly more valuable.\n\nWhat if I aim to trade Sheep for Brick or Ore?\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (3 * 14 = 42 value) for 2 Ore (2 * 33 = 66 value). Net gain: 66 - 42 = +24. This is a good proposal. I still have 21 Sheep left.\n\nLet's try this offer. It's concise and shows a clear value increase for me.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

This means prioritizing trades that give me more value than I give up.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** Each resource has a specific value.

For example, I have a lot of Sheep (24) and Wheat (13). Wheat has the lowest value (5).\n4.  **Deficit Resources:** Identify resources I might need more of, especially those with higher individual value. Ore (33) and Brick (29) have the highest values.

Even a small profit per trade accumulates over 10 turns.\n6.  **Player 1's Acceptance:** Player 1 accepted my last offer (3 Sheep -> 2 Ore).

If there's a high demand for a resource you have in abundance, you can offer more of that resource for more valuable items.\n\n2. **Resource Value Analysis**: Each resource has a different value. Prioritize trading resources that are less valuable to you for those that are more valuable. For example, trading Sheep (which has a relatively low value in this scenario) for Ore or Brick (which have higher values) is advantageous.\n\n3. **Negotiation Techniques**: Building rapport by considering the other player's needs can lead to better deals. If you know Player 0 wants a specific resource, you can leverage that in your offers.\n\n4. **Assessment of Trade Offers**: Always evaluate what you receive versus what you give up. The goal is to increase the total value of resources, so track how trades impact your overall resource value.\n\n5. **Limitations on Quantity**: Be mindful of the quantity of resources you have; trading away too much of a valuable resource could leave you vulnerable in future trades.\n\n### Trading Decision\n\nGiven the current situation and analyzing the previous offers and trades, I will formulate my next trading offer to maximize my resources\u2019 value. \n\n### Making the Trading Offer\n\nAfter evaluating what I currently possess in terms of quantity and value, I see that I have enough excess Sheep and resources. \n\n**My Offer:**\n- **Offering**: 5 Sheep \n- **Requested**: 3 Ore (which has a higher value)\n\nI believe Player 0 may be interested in acquiring more Sheep, and trading them for Ore would improve my overall resource value.\n\n**Proposed Action:**\n```\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 3 Ore]\n```",

This provides a baseline.\n2. **Marginal Value:** Understand the per-unit value of each resource. This is crucial for evaluating offers and making profitable trades.\n3. **Trade Profitability:** A trade is profitable if the total value of the resources acquired is greater than the total value of the resources given up.\n4. **Scarcity and Abundance:** Identify resources in which you have a high quantity versus those you have less of. Generally, you want to trade away abundant, lower-value resources for scarcer, higher-value ones, or higher-value resources for even higher-value ones.\n5. **Opponent's Perspective (Inferred):** While not explicitly known, try to infer what the opponent might need or value based on their offers. If they consistently offer a certain resource, they might have an abundance of it or value it less than what they are requesting. Conversely, if they consistently request a resource, they likely need it or value it highly.\n6. **Negotiation Leverage:** If you have an abundance of a resource the opponent needs, you have more leverage. If you need a resource the opponent has an abundance of, they have leverage.\n7. **Iterative Learning:** Each offer and counter-offer provides information. Learn from accepted and rejected trades to refine your strategy.\n8. **Resource Goals:** Consider short-term and long-term goals for resource accumulation.

The values assigned to resources can guide strategic decisions to ensure a better trade-off.
