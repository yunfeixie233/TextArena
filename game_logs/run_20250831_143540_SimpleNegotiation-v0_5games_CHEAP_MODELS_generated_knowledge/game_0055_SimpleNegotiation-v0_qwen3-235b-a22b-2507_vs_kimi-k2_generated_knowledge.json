      "observation": "\n You are Player 0 in the Negotiation Game.\nYour task is to trade such that the total value of your resources increases.\nThe resources and associated values you currently have are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 12   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 12   Value: 11\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 14   Value: 16\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 18   Value: 24\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 7    Value: 34\n\nBefore making a trading decision, first generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation that applies to your situation.\n\nGenerate Knowledge: What key principles, strategies, or insights about resource trading and negotiation are most relevant to your current situation?\n\nAfter generating this knowledge, apply it to make your trading decision.\n\nUse the following special tokens for actions:\n  - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]': [Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\n  - '[Accept]': To accept an incoming offer.\n  - '[Deny]': To deny an incoming offer (default).\nThe game lasts for 10 turns in total.",
      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**:  \n   The value of each resource (per unit) you hold is:\n   - Wheat: 5 (lowest)\n   - Wood: 11\n   - Sheep: 16\n   - Brick: 24\n   - Ore: 34 (highest)\n\n   This means **Ore** is the most valuable resource you possess, followed by **Brick**, **Sheep**, **Wood**, and **Wheat**. Since Ore is highest in value, trading it away should yield substantial returns. Conversely, Wheat and Wood are lower value, so you may want to acquire more high-value resources in exchange for lower-value ones.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost & Trade Efficiency**:  \n   To increase total value, trades should aim to **net positive value**\u2014i.e., receive resources with higher total value than what is offered. For example:\n   - Trading 1 Sheep (16) for 1 Brick (24) is favorable.\n   - Giving away Ore (34) without getting at least 1 Brick (24) and 1 Sheep (16) or equivalent is likely unfavorable.\n\n3. **Resource Abundance vs. Scarcity**:  \n   You have:\n   - Abundant Brick (18) and Sheep (14)\n   - Moderate Wheat and Wood (12 each)\n   - Scarce Ore (7)\n\n   Since you have a lot of Brick and Sheep, you can use them as trade currency even if their value is high (especially Brick). However, Ore is both valuable and limited\u2014so use it strategically.\n\n4. **Negotiation Strategy - Exploit Comparative Advantage**:  \n   If other players lack resources you have in abundance, you can leverage that. Since you have 18 Brick (highest quantity), you can offer Brick in trades to obtain higher-value resources. Alternatively, offer lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood) to get Sheep or Ore.\n\n5. **Blending High and Low-Value Resources in Offers**:  \n   To make attractive offers, bundle lower-value resources (e.g. Wheat + Wood) to request high-value ones (e.g. Ore). This increases chances of acceptance since the counterparty might undervalue mixed bundles.\n\n6. **Avoid Value Leakage**:  \n   Don\u2019t trade 1:1 on high-value items unless you gain utility. For example, giving 1 Ore (34) for 1 Brick (24) is a loss of 10 value units.\n\n7. **Strategic Goal**:  \n   Your aim is to **increase total portfolio value**. This can be achieved by:\n   - Acquiring high-value resources (Ore, Brick)\n   - Reducing low-value holdings (Wheat, Wood) if possible, but only if trading them increases net value.\n\n8. **Opening Move Consideration**:  \n   As the game starts, no offers have been made. You must make the first move. A strong opening offer should:\n   - Be likely to be accepted (fair but favorable to you)\n   - Use abundant or lower-value resources to acquire higher-value ones\n   - Avoid giving away Ore unless receiving significant value in return\n\nBest Trade Opportunity:  \nYou have 18 Brick (value 24) and 14 Sheep (16). Brick is high in value and quantity\u2014ideal for trading. Even though Brick is valuable, having 18 suggests surplus, so trading some for Ore (value 34) is highly desirable.\n\nA possible exchange: Offer Sheep and Brick to get Ore and Wood\u2014or reverse: give Wood and Wheat to get Sheep or Ore.\n\nBut since Wood (11) and Wheat (5) are lower value, you can use them to acquire higher-value resources.\n\nOptimal Offer Idea:  \nOffer: 3 Wood (3\u00d711=33) + 1 Wheat (5) = 38 value  \nRequest: 1 Ore (34) \u2014 slightly under value, but may be acceptable due to scarcity on their side  \nBut better: Request 1 Ore + 1 Sheep (34+16=50) \u2014 too much, unlikely.\n\nAlternatively:  \nOffer: 2 Wood + 2 Wheat (2\u00d711 + 2\u00d75 = 32)  \nRequest: 1 Ore (34) \u2192 net +2 value\n\nBut do you have recent market info? No\u2014so aim for fair but value-positive trades.\n\nAnother idea: Use Sheep (you have 14) and low-value resources to get Ore.\n\nBut best: Leverage your **Brick surplus**.\n\nTry: Offer: 3 Brick (3\u00d724=72) \u2192 too high to give for one thing.\n\nWait\u2014optimize:\n\nYou need to gain value. So aim for **net positive expected value**.\n\nBest strategy: **Offer lower-value resources to acquire higher-value ones, especially Ore.**\n\nYou have 12 Wood (11) and 12 Wheat (5). Both are lower value. Bundle them.\n\nExample offer:  \n[Offer: 3 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]  \nValue given: 3\u00d711 + 3\u00d75 = 33 + 15 = 48  \nValue received: 34 + 16 = 50 \u2192 net +2\n\nSlight gain. Fair trade\u2014likely to be accepted.\n\nBut perhaps more aggressive:  \n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore] = 44 \u2192 34 \u2192 net +10 for you? No: you give 44, get 34? That\u2019s worse.\n\nWait: You give resources, get resources.\n\nSo if you **give** 4 Wood (44), **get** 1 Ore (34), you lose 10 value\u2014bad.\n\nReverse: Give 3 Wheat (15) + 2 Wood (22) = 37 \u2192 for 1 Ore (34) \u2192 nearly equal, slight loss.\n\nSo better: Give low-value, get high-value in bulk.\n\nBut Ore is 34\u2014the highest. So even 1 Ore is good to receive.\n\nYou have Brick: high quantity (18) and high value (24). So trading Brick for Ore (34) is good\u2014gain 10 value per net unit.\n\nExample:  \nGive 1 Brick (24), get 1 Ore (34) \u2192 net +10  \nBut no one will accept that.\n\nBut: Give 1 Sheep (16) + 1 Brick (24) = 40 \u2192 for 1 Ore (34) \u2192 you lose 6\u2014bad.\n\nWait. Let's flip.\n\nBest approach: **You should offer low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) to get high-value (Ore).**\n\nYou have 12 Wheat and 12 Wood\u2014moderate abundance.\n\nTry:  \n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]  \nValue offered: 5\u00d75 + 2\u00d711 = 25 + 22 = 47  \nValue received: 34 \u2192 you lose 13 \u2192 bad.\n\nNo. You must **receive more value than you give**.\n\nSo reverse:  \nOffer: 2 Ore? \u2192 too valuable.\n\nAlternatively, **receive Brick or Sheep? But you already have many.**\n\nAha: Unless a resource has high value and you are low, you shouldn't seek it.\n\nYou have:\n- Wheat: 12 \u2192 value 5\n- Wood: 12 \u2192 11\n- Sheep: 14 \u2192 16\n- Brick: 18 \u2192 24 \u2705\n- Ore: 7 \u2192 34 \u2705\n\nEven though you have 7 Ore, it's highly valuable. Acquiring more is good.\n\nBut you have a lot of Brick and Sheep\u2014trading some away for Ore is smart.\n\nSo: **Offer Brick and Sheep to get Ore** \u2014 only if you gain value.\n\nBut Brick is 24, Ore is 34 \u2014 so you must offer less than 34 in value to get +10.\n\nExample:  \nOffer: 1 Brick (24) \u2192 get 1 Ore (34) \u2192 net +10 for you. But no one will give 34 for 24.\n\nUnlikely.\n\nBut: Offer: 1 Brick + 1 Sheep (24+16=40) \u2192 get 1 Ore (34) \u2192 you lose 6 \u2014 bad.\n\nSo instead: **Offer low-value mix to obtain Ore**\n\nBut hard because low-value sum must be high to entice.\n\nAlternatively: **Offer 3 Wood (33) and receive 1 Ore (34)** \u2192 for them, they gain 1 value. Possible.\n\nBut then you gain 1 value.\n\nEven better: **Offer 2 Wood (22) and 2 Wheat (10) = 32 \u2192 get 1 Ore (34)** \u2192 net +2 for you, -2 for them \u2014 close.\n\nMay not accept.\n\nBut if they need Wood/Wheat, they may.\n\nAlternatively, **make a balanced offer that wins on volume or necessity**.\n\nWait\u2014better insight: **You have surplus Brick. Maybe others need it. But you don't want to lose too much value**.\n\nBut your **highest quantity is Brick (18)** \u2014 even though value is 24, having 18 means you can afford to trade some if you gain value.\n\nBut giving Brick for Sheep (16) would lose value.\n\nSo: Only trade Brick for Ore.\n\nSimilarly, trade Wheat and Wood for Ore or Brick.\n\nBest opportunity: **Trade Wheat and Wood for Ore**.\n\nYou have 12 of each\u2014plenty.\n\nSo offer:  \n3 Wood (33) + 3 Wheat (15) = 48 value offered  \nIn return, ask for 1 Ore (34) and 1 Sheep (16) = 50 \u2014 slightly better (net +2 for you)\n\nBut 48 out, 50 in \u2192 +2\n\nOr even better: 2 Wood + 3 Wheat = 22+15=37 \u2192 ask for 1 Ore (34) only \u2192 net +3 for you? No: you give 37, get 34 \u2192 -3\n\nBad.\n\nWait: **You give what you offer, receive what you request.**\n\nSo to gain value: sum(requested) > sum(offered)\n\nSo best: Offer 2 Wood (22) + 1 Wheat (5) = 27  \nRequest: 1 Ore (34) \u2192 net +7 value \u2192 highly favorable\n\nBut is anyone going to accept giving 34 for 27? Possibly, if they are desperate for Wood/Wheat.\n\nBut low chance.\n\nAlternatively, make a **fair but value-positive trade** using a surplus you can afford.\n\nYou have 14 Sheep (16) \u2014 high quantity, medium-high value.\n\nIf you give 2 Sheep (32) and get 1 Ore (34) \u2192 net +2\n\nGood.\n\nAnd you have 14\u2014can spare 2.\n\nSo: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nValue given: 32, received: 34 \u2192 net +2\n\nThis is efficient.\n\nBut will it be accepted? You don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s reasonable.\n\nBut perhaps increase attractiveness for counterparty.\n\nCounteroffer: [Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nYou give: 11 + 16 = 27  \nReceive: 34 \u2192 net +7\n\nEven better.\n\nYou have 12 Wood and 14 Sheep\u2014plenty.\n\nHigh value gain.\n\nLikely acceptable\u2014it\u2019s only one Ore, and they get two different resources.\n\nThis trade increases your total value by 7 per transaction.\n\nYes.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**:  \n   The value of each resource from my perspective is:  \n   - Ore: 34 (highest)  \n   - Brick: 24  \n   - Sheep: 16  \n   - Wood: 11  \n   - Wheat: 5 (lowest)  \n\n   This means I should prioritize acquiring **Ore** and **Brick**, as they contribute most to my total value. I should be willing to trade away lower-value resources like **Wheat** and **Wood** to obtain them.\n\n2. **Abundance vs. Scarcity in My Inventory**:  \n   - **High quantity, low value**: Wheat (12) and Wood (12) \u2014 good to trade away.  \n   - **High quantity, high value**: Brick (18) \u2014 though valuable, I have a large stock; may be used strategically in trades.  \n   - **Moderate quantity, high value**: Sheep (14), Ore (7) \u2014 both valuable; Sheep are more abundant, so I could potentially trade some Sheep if it brings in Ore.  \n\n   I have relatively little **Ore** (7), so acquiring more is a high priority.\n\n3. **Trade Efficiency and Value Exchange**:  \n   A good trade should increase my **total valuation**. For example:  \n   - Giving up 3 Wood (3 \u00d7 11 = 33) and 3 Wheat (3 \u00d7 5 = 15) = 48 value.  \n   - Requesting 1 Sheep (16) and 1 Ore (34) = 50 value.  \n   My prior offer was nearly fair (48 out, 50 in) \u2014 likely rejected for slim margin or Player 1\u2019s resource needs.\n\n4. **Negotiation Strategy**:  \n   - Start with reasonable but favorable offers.  \n   - After a rejection, either improve the offer or wait for counter-proposal.  \n   - Since Player 1 made no counter-offer, they may want different resources or better terms.  \n\n   I should consider what Player 1 might value. Without knowing their inventory, I must infer:  \n   - Players generally need diverse resources; Wheat and Wood are low-value for me, but may be high-demand for others.  \n   - Offering more of low-value resources could entice others to give up high-value ones like Ore.\n\n5. **Iterative Bargaining**:  \n   Since no counter was offered, Player 1 may be waiting for a better deal. I should adjust my offer to make it more attractive \u2014 possibly offering more Wheat/Wood for Ore or Sheep.\n\n6. **Preservation of High-Value Resources**:  \n   I should avoid giving away **Ore** unless receiving significantly more in return (e.g., multiple Brick or Sheep). Similarly, **Brick** should be traded only for equal or greater value.\n\n7. **Next Move Strategy**:  \n   Revise my previous offer to increase attractiveness \u2014 offer more low-value resources (Wheat/Wood) to obtain more **Ore**, or trade excess **Brick** if needed to acquire **Ore**.\n\nRevised Offer Idea:  \nOffer: 4 Wheat + 2 Wood \u2192 1 Ore (Value: 66 out, 34 in \u2014 wait, no! That would be bad.)\n\nWait \u2014 correction:  \n- Wheat (value 5), Wood (11), Ore (34).  \n\nSo offering:  \n- 5 Wheat (25) + 1 Wood (11) = 36 value \u2192 request 1 Ore (34)  \nThis is slightly favorable to me. Better:  \n- 4 Wheat (20) + 2 Wood (22) = 42 \u2192 request 1 Ore (34) \u2192 favorable to trader. Not ideal for me.\n\nWait: I want to **gain value**. So I must request more value than I give.\n\nBetter:  \nOffer low-value surplus: e.g., 3 Wood (33) + 3 Wheat (15) = 48 \u2192 request 1 Ore (34) + 1 Sheep (16) = 50 \u2192 net +2.  \nThis is efficient. My last offer was this \u2014 rejected.\n\nSo perhaps Player 1 lacks Sheep or Ore.\n\nAlternative: Offer **Brick** to acquire **Ore**.  \n- I have 18 Brick \u2014 can afford to trade some.  \n- 2 Brick = 48 value \u2014 so 1 Ore (34) is less.  \nSo: Offer 1 Brick (24) \u2192 Request 1 Ore (34): I gain 10 value. But would someone give 34 for 24? Possibly. But risky.\n\nBut I already tried offering mixed low-value for high-value.\n\nNew tactic: **Offer more desirable combo** \u2014 maybe focus on resources others need for development.\n\nSheep are valuable to me (16), but maybe others have surplus. Brick is high value (24), but I have 18 \u2014 perhaps I can use it to barter.\n\nTry: Offer 5 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 request 2 Ore  \n- Out: 5\u00d75=25 + 3\u00d711=33 \u2192 58  \n- In: 2\u00d734=68 \u2192 gain 10 value. Great trade.\n\nBut is 5 Wheat and 3 Wood acceptable? I have 12 Wheat and 12 Wood \u2014 feasible.\n\nAlternatively, smaller step:  \nOffer 4 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore + 1 Sheep  \n- Out: 20 + 33 = 53  \n- In: 34 + 16 = 50 \u2192 net -3 \u2192 bad.\n\nNo.\n\nStick to: Maximize net value gain, give up low-value goods.\n\nBest: Focus on acquiring **Ore** at lowest cost.\n\nTry: Offer 6 Wheat + 2 Wood \u2192 1 Ore  \n- Out: 30 + 22 = 52  \n- In: 34 \u2192 I lose value? 52 > 34 \u2192 bad.\n\nWait! I must **not** give more value than I receive.\n\nCritical: **Only accept or make offers where requested resources' total value \u2265 offered resources' total value.**\n\nSo to get 1 Ore (34), I can offer up to 34 in value.\n\nBest to offer a mix that totals \u226434 in value, request 34.\n\nExample:  \n- Offer: 3 Wood (33) \u2192 Request: 1 Ore (34) \u2192 +1 value. Good.\nOr: 6 Wheat (30) \u2192 Request: 1 Ore (34) \u2192 +4 value. Even better.\n\nBut can I trade 6 Wheat for 1 Ore? Maybe seems excessive, but from my valuation it\u2019s great.\n\nBut Player 1 might not want 6 Wheat.\n\nSince my previous offer of 3Wd + 3Wt for 1Ore + 1Sheep (48 out, 50 in) was rejected, perhaps they want **Brick** or **Sheep**.\n\nMaybe offer **Sheep** to get **Ore**?\n\nBut Sheep value 16, Ore 34 \u2014 so 2 Sheep (32) for 1 Ore (34) \u2192 +2 \u2014 acceptable.\n\nBut I have 14 Sheep \u2014 possible.\n\nBut I value Sheep highly; better to use low-value goods.\n\nWait \u2014 I value **Ore** the most. So I should aggressively seek to acquire Ore, even with slightly less favorable trades.\n\nBut must stay value-positive.\n\nBest available strategy:  \nUse **Wheat** and **Wood** (low value, high stock) to obtain **Ore**.\n\nNew Offer:  \nOffer: 5 Wheat + 2 Wood \u2192 Request: 1 Ore  \n- Value out: 5\u00d75 = 25, 2\u00d711 = 22 \u2192 47  \n- Value in: 34  \n- Net: -13 \u2192 BAD.\n\nNo! I keep flipping the math.\n\nClarify:\n\n**I gain if I receive more value than I give.**\n\nSo:  \n- I want: Total(value of requested) > Total(value of offered)\n\nTo get 1 Ore (34), I must offer resources totaling **less than 34** in value.\n\nBest combinations I can offer under 34 in total:\n\n- 3 Wood = 33 \u2192 Request 1 Ore (34) \u2192 gain 1 \u2192 good\n- 6 Wheat = 30 \u2192 Request 1 Ore (34) \u2192 gain 4 \u2192 better\n- 1 Wood (11) + 4 Wheat (20) = 31 \u2192 Request Ore \u2192 gain 3\n- 2 Wood (22) + 2 Wheat (10) = 32 \u2192 Request Ore \u2192 gain 2\n\nBut Player might not want small amounts.\n\nAlternatively, offer 3 Wood for 1 Ore \u2014 clean, fair, slightly in my favor.\n\nBut my earlier offer (3Wd+3Wt for Ore+Sheep) was fair/slightly in my favor \u2014 rejected.\n\nMaybe try: Offer **Brick**? 1 Brick = 24 \u2014 I can request 1 Ore (34) \u2014 but must add something to get balance.\n\nWait: I can **request more than one resource**.\n\nBetter: Offer 1 Brick (24) + 1 Wheat (5) = 29 \u2192 Request 1 Ore (34) \u2192 gain 5\n\nOr: Offer 2 Sheep (32) \u2192 Request 1 Ore (34) \u2192 gain 2\n\nBut again, I prefer to use low-value goods.\n\nBut I only have low-value goods at 5 and 11.\n\nSo: 3 Wood (33) \u2192 1 Ore (34) is excellent.\n\nTry that.\n\nBut maybe Player 1 wants **Wheat** more?

      "response": "Generate Knowledge \u2013 Key Principles and Insights  \n\n1. Valuation: Your resources (Brick, Ore) are among the most highly-valued on your ledger (30 & 34). Do not let others acquire the scarcest, highest-value items unless you gain more net value in return.  \n\n2. Scarcity & Marginal Value: You already hold large quantities of the lower-valued resources (Wood 19, Wheat 10). Off-loading 1\u20132 extra of those is advantageous, but resist parting with low-quantity, high-value resources unless the deal is strongly in your favor.  \n\n3. Organic Surplus Principle: Most competitive trades shift you from \u201csurplus\u201d \u2192 \u201cscarcity\u201d of a lower-value resource to acquire \u201cscarcity\u201d \u2192 \u201csurplus\u201d of a higher-value resource. Concretely, swap excess Wood/Wheat for Brick/Ore/Sheep.  \n\n4. Offer Construction:  \n   \u2013 Be concise and generous (just enough to appear fair) rather than greedy (which triggers rejection).  \n   \u2013 Avoid fractional-value trades; strive for at least 1.5\u00d7 value gain in your favor.  \n\n5. Posture & Reciprocity: After four rejections, Player 0 has shown an appetite for Ore/Brick and a willingness to part with Wood/Wheat. A fresh, clear offer that gives them something they value (Wood) while rewarding you with Brick or Ore is more likely to succeed than wide, multi-pair swaps.\n\nValuation Check of Previous Offers (for reference)  \n- Offer 1: 3 Wood (3\u00d79=27) + 3 Wheat (3\u00d76=18) \u2192 1 Ore (34) + 1 Sheep (12).

Net change for us: +2 Ore +1 Brick \u22124 Wood \u22121 Wheat = +56 value (clear gain), but Player 0 rejected (they likely value Ore/Brick highly too).\n\nNew Offer Design  \nTarget: give spare Wood/Wheat while picking up Brick or Ore.  \nWe can afford to part with Wood because we have 19 units. Giving away 3 Wood (~27 value) to gain 1 Brick (30 value) already yields a pure gain. Since Brick is also scarce to us (only 11), one extra Brick moves the needle strongly. Offering an additional sheep (which we only have 6 of) is a small concession if it sweetens the deal without wrecking our creature comforts.\n\nChosen Trade \u2013 balanced, clear, fair-looking:  \n[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick, 1 Ore]",

For example:\n   - Giving low-value resources (Wheat = 5, Wood = 11) to gain high-value ones (Ore, Brick, Sheep) is favorable.\n   - Avoid trades that give high-value resources for lower ones unless surplus or strategic.\n\n5. **Current Offers Analysis**:\n   - Player 1 previously offered: 2 Ore, 1 Wood \u2192 1 Brick.\n     - Value offered to me: 2\u00d734 + 1\u00d711 = 68 + 11 = 79\n     - Value I give: 1\u00d724 = 24\n     - Net gain: +55 \u2014 **highly favorable**\n   - Yet, I previously rejected this. That may have been a mistake.\n\n6. **Psychological Timing**: After rejecting multiple times, Player 1 may be less willing to trade. I should seize advantageous offers when they arise.\n\n7. **Strategic Adjustment**: My previous offers were suboptimal:\n   - Offering 3 Wood + 3 Wheat (value: 33 + 15 = 48) for 1 Ore + 1 Sheep (value: 34 + 16 = 50) \u2192 nearly fair, but slight upside.\n   - But Player 1 rejected \u2014 perhaps perceived as exploitative or timing issue.\n\n8. **Reassessment of Rejections**: The offer from Player 1 of 2 Ore and 1 Wood for 1 Brick is excellent value. Rejecting it was suboptimal. I should consider accepting such offers when they reappear.\n\nAction:  \n[Accept]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: What key principles, strategies, or insights about resource trading and negotiation are most relevant to your current situation?\n\n1. Marginal-unit valuation  \n   \u2022 Each resource\u2019s displayed value is an average. Because supply varies, the *next* unit you lose/gain is often valued differently.  \n   \u2022 I have only 11 Brick (value 30) and 11 Sheep left after the last round. The *last* Brick or Sheep is now worth noticeably more than the series average, so do not give away additional Brick or Sheep without a very large premium.\n\n2. Improve your \u201cvalue density\u201d  \n   \u2022 Ore totals 34, much higher than any other resource. Bundling excess Ore is the cheapest way for me to increase the average value of what I keep.  \n   \u2022 Wood and Wheat are plentiful and low-valued (marginal Wheat value is close to 6, Wood to 9). These should be the first chips offered.\n\n3. Avoid lopsided trades for scarce commodities  \n   \u2022 In the last completed exchange I received 1 Brick + lost 2 Ore + lost 1 Wood. Net, I gave up 78 in value (2 \u00d7 34 + 9 = 77) for 30. That worked only because Brick became marginally critical. I mustn\u2019t repeat a negative-EV trade unless Brick is urgently needed.\n\n4. Present asymmetric offers *to the opponent\u2019s likely bottleneck*  \n   \u2022 Before my Brick infusion I had only 11. If Player 0 now perceives Brick as scarce, offering two Ore + spare Wheat/Wood could pry 1 Brick for a wash or slight gain.\n\n5. End-game timing  \n   \u2022 Only 10 total turns exist and at least 6 have passed. Future deals may dwindle; prioritize trades now.\n\nWith these in mind, examine current holdings after the last trade:\n- Wood: 19 \u2013 1 = 18  \n- Wheat: 10 \u2013 0 = 10  \n- Sheep: 6 \u2013 0 = 6  \n- Brick: 11 + 1 = 12  \n- Ore : 21 \u2013 2 = 19  \n\nI would like to flip two over-supplied Ore (each ~34) for one of the scarcer high-value resources. My sheep count is likewise low, so I will *not* give away Sheep any more. Brick remains the premium target.\n\nApply the knowledge:\nOffer Player 0 two Ore\u2014my cheapest high-quantity surplus\u2014while requesting the brick they just acquired (value 30). Player 0 values ore at 34, so for them two Ore nets 68 virtual value, whereas giving 1 Brick costs 30\u2014strictly favorable. I, in return, get 30 value for 68 in Ore, but because Ore is abundant the marginal Ore becomes less useful than an additional Brick.\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Value Maximization Principle**: The goal is to increase the total value of your resource portfolio. Therefore, trades should aim to acquire high-value resources (like Ore at 34) or exchange low-value resources for higher-value ones, even in unequal quantities if strategically beneficial.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost Awareness**: Resources have different production efficiencies and scarcity. Ore (value 34) is the most valuable and likely scarce. Being able to acquire Ore at a discount (e.g., trading lower-value resources like Brick or Wood) improves portfolio value.\n\n3. **Asymmetric Valuation Insight**: Other players may value resources differently. An offer that gives away slightly more in total value might still be acceptable if it balances your inventory toward higher-value resources.\n\n4. **Leveraging Surplus**: Brick (18 units) and Wheat (12 units) are held in high quantity. Trading excess Brick for higher-value Ore or Sheep improves utility, even if multiple units of Brick are exchanged for one unit of a rarer resource.\n\n5. **Incremental Gain Strategy**: Accepting small, consistent value gains (e.g., 1 Ore for 1 Brick) can compound over turns. The recent accepted trade (2 Ore, 1 Wood \u2192 1 Brick) gave up 2 Ore (68 value) for 1 Brick (24 value) \u2014 this was a poor trade, but may have been accepted by mistake. Going forward, avoid such losses.\n\n6. **Defensive Trading**: Avoid trades that deplete high-value resources (Ore) unless receiving significant surplus value in return. Conversely, target acquiring Ore from others at fair or favorable terms.\n\n7. **Offer Timing and Rejection Patterns**: Previous offers from Player 0 were rejected, suggesting they were unfavorable to Player 1. Offers need to be mutually beneficial. Also, Player 1 is attempting to trade Ore for Brick, indicating they may value Brick more than average.\n\n8. **Current Trade Offer Analysis**: Player 1 now offers: 2 Ore \u2192 1 Brick.  \n   - Value given to you: 2\u00d734 = 68  \n   - Value you give: 1\u00d724 = 24  \n   - Net gain: +44 value  \n   This is highly favorable.\n\nDecision:  \nThe offer from Player 1 gives 2 Ore (total value 68) for only 1 Brick (value 24). This significantly increases the total value of my resources. Despite having only 7 Ore initially and some already traded away, *receiving* more Ore is advantageous.  \n\n[Accept]",
