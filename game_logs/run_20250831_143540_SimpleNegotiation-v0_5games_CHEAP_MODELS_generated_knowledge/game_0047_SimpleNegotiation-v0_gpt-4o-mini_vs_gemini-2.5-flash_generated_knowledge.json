This means any trade must result in a net gain in value. I need to calculate the value of both sides of an offer carefully.\n2.  **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:** I have large quantities of all resources. This means I'm not desperate for any particular resource, which gives me leverage. However, I should be mindful of not running out of a particular resource if it's highly valuable, especially if I can use it later to acquire other even more valuable resources. My quantities are around 23-25 for most, except Wood (8).\n3.  **Relative Value Comparison:** I need to compare the value of what I'm giving versus what I'm receiving.\n    *   Wheat: 5\n    *   Wood: 9\n    *   Sheep: 12\n    *   Brick: 27\n    *   Ore: 35 (Highest Value)\n4.  **Identifying Beneficial Trades:** A trade is beneficial if `Value(Requested Resources) > Value(Offered Resources)`.\n    *   Value of Offered items (3 Sheep, 2 Ore): (3 * 12) + (2 * 35) = 36 + 70 = 106\n    *   Value of Requested items (5 Brick, 2 Sheep): (5 * 27) + (2 * 12) = 135 + 24 = 159\n    *   Net Gain from Player 0's offer: 159 - 106 = 53.

They are offering a good deal from my perspective, perhaps indicating they value Brick highly or have an abundance of Sheep/Ore.\n6.  **First Turn Strategy:** Since it's the first turn, and the offer is highly favorable, accepting it can set a positive tone and provide a significant value boost early on. There's no immediate need to haggle if the offer is clearly good.\n7.  **Resource Balance After Trade:**\n    *   Wheat: 23 (no change)\n    *   Wood: 8 (no change)\n    *   Sheep: 23 - 3 (offered) + 2 (requested) = 22\n    *   Brick: 25 + 5 (requested) = 30\n    *   Ore: 23 - 2 (offered) = 21\n    My quantities remain healthy across the board.

      "response": "## Generate Knowledge\n\n1.  **Objective Function**: My primary goal is to increase the *total value* of my resources. This means I should always evaluate trades based on the net change in value.\n2.  **Resource Valuation**: I have explicit values for each resource. I can calculate the current total value of my resources to establish a baseline.\n    *   Wheat: 5\n    *   Wood: 9\n    *   Sheep: 12\n    *   Brick: 27\n    *   Ore: 35\n3.  **Trade Evaluation Formula**: For any offer `A (offered) -> B (requested)`, I need to calculate `Value(B) - Value(A)`. If this is positive, the trade *can* be beneficial.\n4.  **Scarcity/Abundance**: My current quantities matter. While I have plenty of Brick and value it highly (25 units, value 27), I also have a significant amount of Ore (23 units, value 35). My Sheep and Wheat quantities are also high. Wood is my scarcest resource (8 units).\n5.  **Strategic Resource Retention**: Even if a trade is profitable, I should consider if I need to retain a certain amount of a high-value resource for future rounds or potential *better* offers. For example, Ore is my highest value resource; giving it up should only be for a substantial gain or if I have too much.\n6.  **Negotiation Posture**: Player 0 just made an offer. This means they are actively seeking resources. I can either accept, deny, or make a counter-offer. Since this is only turn 1 (or early turns, given no turn counter was explicitly given), I have time for negotiation.\n7.  **Evaluating the current offer**: Player 0 offers 4 Wood for 2 Ore.\n    *   Value of 4 Wood: 4 * 9 = 36\n    *   Value of 2 Ore: 2 * 35 = 70\n    *   Net change: 36 (gained) - 70 (lost) = -34. This is a significantly negative trade for me. I should not accept this.\n\n## Trading Decision\n\nThe current offer from Player 0 is: `4 Wood -> 2 Ore`.\nCalculate the value change for me:\n*   Value of what I receive (4 Wood): $4 \\times 9 = 36$\n*   Value of what I give away (2 Ore): $2 \\times 35 = 70$\n*   Net change in value: $36 - 70 = -34$\n\nThis trade would decrease my total resource value by 34, which is unacceptable. I will deny this offer. I should also consider making a counter-offer that is beneficial to me. I have plenty of Brick and Ore, which are high-value. Wood is my scarcest, so receiving it is good, but not at such a high cost.\n\nMy current total value:\n23 Wheat * 5 = 115\n8 Wood * 9 = 72\n23 Sheep * 12 = 276\n25 Brick * 27 = 675\n23 Ore * 35 = 805\nTotal = 1943\n\nI want to increase this.\n\nI will deny the current offer and make a counter-offer that leverages my abundant high-value resources (like Brick or Ore) for resources Player 0 might need, but at a fair or advantageous rate for me.\n\nPlayer 0 requested Ore. They might value it highly. I have a lot of Brick.\nWhat if I offer Brick for Wood?\nOr maybe some Ore for a lot of Wood, but at my terms.\n\nLet's consider offering 1 Ore for 3 Wood.\nValue of 1 Ore given = 35\nValue of 3 Wood received = 3 * 9 = 27\nStill negative for me (-8). Not ideal.\n\nHow about giving 1 Brick for 2 Wood?\nValue of 1 Brick given = 27\nValue of 2 Wood received = 2 * 9 = 18\nStill negative for me (-9).\n\nLet's try to ask for something that is very high value.\nPlayer 0 just offered Wood. What if I counter-offer by giving a low-value resource for a high-value resource from them? But that's usually not how negotiation works after they state their need.\n\nPlayer 0 wants Ore. I have plenty.\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore for something high-value from them?\nNo, I need to make an offer that *I* want.\n\nOkay, let's reverse Player 0's bad offer.\nI want Wood. I need to get it for cheap or trade something I have in large excess.\nI have a lot of Brick (25) and Ore (23), both high value. Sheep (23) and Wheat (23) are also high. Only Wood (8) is low.\n\nLet's aim for a positive value trade.\nOffer: 1 Wheat (value 5)\nRequest: 1 Wood (value 9)\nNet +4 for me. This is a small gain but positive.\n\nOffer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood\nValue Given: 2*5 = 10\nValue Received: 1*9 = 9\nNet -1 for me. Bad.\n\nWhat if I offer a low-value resource from my side and ask for a higher-value resource from their side that they might have in abundance (assuming they have what I want)?\n\nLet's counter the `4 Wood -> 2 Ore` offer. Player 0 wants Ore.\nI have a LOT of Brick. What if I offer Brick for Wood?\nMy goal is to increase my overall value or get scarce resources. Wood is scarce for me.\n\nLet's try to make a counter offer that requests more wood for a minimal loss or a small gain.\nOriginal offer: 4 Wood (36 value) for 2 Ore (70 value).\nI will deny this.\n\nI will make a counter-offer that targets gaining Wood.\nIf I offer 1 Ore (value 35), what can I ask for?\nI need more than 35 value in return. Maybe 4 Wood (value 36)? That's barely positive (+1).\nPerhaps 1 Ore for 2 Sheep and 1 Wood?\n1 Ore: 35\n2 Sheep (2*12=24) + 1 Wood (9) = 33. Still negative (-2).\n\nIt seems Player 0 wants high-value resources. I want to give low-value resources or surplus high-value resources for gains.\n\nGiven I have a lot of Brick (25) and it's high value (27), maybe I can use it to get Wood.\nOffer: 1 Brick (27)\nRequest: 3 Wood (27)\nNet 0. Not improving my overall value, but increases my scarce Wood quantity. This is a quantity gain for specific resource, but not value gain.\n\nI will make a positive value counter-offer.\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep (value 12) for 2 Wood (value 18)?\nNet +6. This increases my Wood and my overall value.\n\nWhat if they don't have Sheep? Player 0 just offered Wood. Can I assume they have Wood? Yes.\nSo a reasonable offer could be to give something of lower value that I have in abundance for Wood.\nI have 23 Wheat, 23 Sheep, 25 Brick, 23 Ore. All in abundance relative to Wood.\n\nLet's try to make a significant gain.\nOffer: 1 Wheat (5)\nRequest: 1 Sheep (12)\nNet +7. A solid gain.\n\nBut Player 0 just offered Wood for Ore. So they need Ore or have Wood they want to trade away for something they need.\n\nMy current action:\n1. Deny the current offer (4 Wood -> 2 Ore) because it's a net loss of 34 value.\n2. Make a new offer. I want to increase total value, and I also want more Wood.\n\nI will formulate an offer that gives me a clear value gain and targets Wood, which I need.\n\n*   **Offer:** 1 Sheep (Value: 12)\n*   **Request:** 2 Wood (Value: 18)\n*   **Net Change:** +6 (18 - 12)\n\nThis is a clear positive value increase for me and gets me the scarce resource.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value-based Trading:** My primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade I make should result in me receiving resources with a higher total value than the resources I give away.\n2.  **Scarcity and Demand (Player 0's Perspective):** While I don't know Player 0's inventory, their recent offers (4 Wood -> 2 Ore) suggest they might value Wood highly relative to their Ore, or perhaps they have a surplus of Wood they want to offload for something they need (Ore). Their acceptance of 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood indicates a strong preference for Wood, or a shortage.\n3.  **My Resource Holdings & Priorities:**\n    *   I have a significant amount of Brick (25) and Ore (23), which have the highest individual values (27 and 35 respectively).\n    *   Wheat (23, Value 5) and Sheep (23, Value 12) are present in similar quantities but Sheep is significantly more valuable.\n    *   Wood (8, Value 9) is my scarcest resource.\n4.  **Identifying Good Trades:** Look for opportunities to trade low-value-per-unit resources for high-value-per-unit resources, or to trade resources I have in surplus for resources I need (especially if their value is higher). Given my low Wood quantity, acquiring more of it, especially for something less valuable, could be beneficial.\n5.  **Negotiation Leverage:** My abundance of high-value resources (Brick, Ore) could be used as leverage if Player 0 needs them. My scarcity of Wood might make me a buyer for it.\n6.  **Past Trades Analysis:**\n    *   `Player 0 offered: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> Requested: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep` (I accepted). This trade yielded: (5 Brick * 27) + (2 Sheep * 12) = 135 + 24 = 159. Cost: (3 Sheep * 12) + (2 Ore * 35) = 36 + 70 = 106. Net gain: 159 - 106 = +53. This was a very good trade for me, effectively turning high-value Ore into even higher value Brick. My quantities of Sheep and Ore decreased, and Brick increased.\n    *   `Player 0 offered: 4 Wood -> Requested: 2 Ore` (I rejected). My value gain calculation: (2 Ore * 35) = 70. Player 0 wanted 2 Ore for 4 Wood. My cost: (4 Wood * 9) = 36. This would have been a gain of +34 for me (70-36). I rejected it, which was a mistake based purely on value calculation. Perhaps I rejected due to a perceived high demand for Wood on my part, or a general reluctance to part with Ore, even for a net gain. I should be more strict with value calculation moving forward.\n    *   `Player 1 offered: 1 Sheep -> Requested: 2 Wood` (Player 0 accepted). My value gain calculation: (2 Wood * 9) = 18. My cost: (1 Sheep * 12) = 12. Net gain: +6. This was a small but positive trade, acquiring my scarcest resource. Player 0's acceptance confirms their high demand for Wood.\n\nNow, my resources are (updated based on previous trades):\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 23   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 10   Value: 9 (8 initial - 0 + 2 acquired)\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 21   Value: 12 (23 initial - 3 + 2 - 1)\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 30   Value: 27 (25 initial + 5)\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 21   Value: 35 (23 initial - 2)\n\nI currently have ample Brick and Ore, and a moderate amount of Sheep and Wheat. Wood is still my lowest quantity resource. Player 0 has shown high demand for Wood.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n*   I can afford to offer high-value resources like Brick or Ore if the return is even higher value, or if it helps me rebalance my inventory by acquiring more Wood.\n*   Player 0 seems to desire Wood. I can leverage this by offering Wood from my now slightly increased (but still lowest) stock, but only for a very good return. Or, if they continue to offer Wood, I should strongly consider accepting if it provides a positive value swing.\n\nDecision: Player 0 just accepted my offer of 1 Sheep for 2 Wood. Now it's my turn to make an offer. Given Player 0's clear desire for Wood and their acceptance of my previous offer, I should try to capitalize on this. I still have a decent amount of Sheep and a surplus of high-value Brick and Ore. My Wood quantity is low. I can aim to convert some of my lower-value Sheep or Wheat, or even some high-value Ore/Brick (if the return is exceptional) into more Wood.\n\nI want to increase my total value. Player 0 seems keen on Wood. My Sheep are moderately valuable.\nLet's calculate a potential trade:\nOffer: 2 Sheep (Value 2*12=24)\nRequest: 3 Wood (Value 3*9=27). This is a +3 gain. It's small, but it addresses my Wood scarcity and gives me a net positive value.\nAlternatively:\nOffer: 1 Wheat (Value 5)\nRequest: 1 Wood (Value 9). This is a +4 gain. It's a very good ratio for me. They accepted 1 Sheep for 2 Wood, which means they value Wood highly. It's a small offer, less risky towards being denied.\n\nLet's try to get more Wood, as it is my scarcest resource and Player 0 seems to value it.\n\n[Offer: 1 Wheat -> 1 Wood]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade I make or accept must result in a net gain in value for me. I need to calculate the value of both sides of a proposed trade.\n2.  **Scarcity and Demand:** While not explicitly stated, understanding that some resources might be more sought after by an opponent (e.g., if they are building something specific) can give me leverage. Conversely, I should prioritize acquiring resources that are highly valuable to me.\n3.  **Resource Ratios:** I should aim for favorable exchange ratios. For example, if I trade a low-value resource for a high-value resource, even if the quantities are similar, it's a good trade.\n4.  **Strategic Asset Retention:** I should be cautious about trading away my highest-value resources unless the return is exceptionally good. My current highest value resources are Ore (35), Brick (27), and Sheep (12).\n5.  **Opponent's Perspective (Inferred):** Although I don't know Player 0's exact inventory, their offers can give clues. Their past offers for 'Ore' and 'Wood' might indicate a need for those. Their acceptance of 'Sheep' for 'Wood' and 'Wheat' for 'Wood' also suggests they value Wood.\n6.  **Current Inventory Analysis:**\n    *   Wheat: 23 Qty, 5 Value (Total 115) - Low value. Good for trading away.\n    *   Wood: 8 Qty, 9 Value (Total 72) - Medium value, low quantity. Player 0 has requested this frequently. Could be a good resource to acquire or trade carefully.\n    *   Sheep: 23 Qty, 12 Value (Total 276) - Medium/High value, high quantity. Potentially liquid.\n    *   Brick: 25 Qty, 27 Value (Total 675) - High value, high quantity. Good to keep, but perhaps trade a small amount for a very good return.\n    *   Ore: 23 Qty, 35 Value (Total 805) - Highest value, high quantity. Very important to retain or get significant returns for.\n7.  **Calculating Trade Value:** For any offer, calculate (Value of Requested Resources) - (Value of Offered Resources). This difference must be positive for me.\n\nMy current total value: (23*5) + (8*9) + (23*12) + (25*27) + (23*35) = 115 + 72 + 276 + 675 + 805 = 1943.\n\nPrevious Turn Analysis:\n*   My last two offers (1 Sheep -> 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Wood) were accepted.\n    *   1 Sheep (12) -> 2 Wood (18). Net profit: 18 - 12 = +6. Good trade.\n    *   1 Wheat (5) -> 1 Wood (9). Net profit: 9 - 5 = +4. Good trade.\n*   Player 0 seems to consistently need Wood. This is a strong indicator.\n\nConsidering Player 0's likely need for Wood, and my desire to increase total value, my strategy will be to trade low-value resources (Wheat, perhaps Sheep) for Wood, or for higher-value resources like Brick or Ore if offered at a good ratio. I have low quantity of Wood, so acquiring more could also be helpful if I want to use it for future high-value trades.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep and Wheat, which are my lower value resources. Wood is relatively low in quantity for me.\n\nThe last trade was 1 Wheat -> 1 Wood. Based on current values: 5 -> 9. This is a +4 gain. I could try to repeat this or slightly improve it.\n\nWhat about acquiring Ore or Brick? If I can get 1 Ore (35) for something like 2 Sheep (24) and 1 Wood (9) -> 33, it's a small gain.\nMy Ore and Brick quantities are high, and they are my most valuable resources. I should only trade them if the return is extremely high.\n\nPlayer 0 might be trying to gain Wood. I could offer Wheat for Wood again.\n\nLet's look at the current resources to see what trade makes sense.\nMy Wheat: 23 (Value 5)\nMy Wood: 8 (Value 9)\nMy Sheep: 23 (Value 12)\nMy Brick: 25 (Value 27)\nMy Ore: 23 (Value 35)\n\nI could offer 1 Wheat for 1 Wood again (+4 value for me).\nOr, I could try to push for 2 Wood for 1 Wheat, but that might be too much of a loss for Player 0 (18 vs 5 valuation for me).\nWhat about offering a bit more for Wood? Maybe 1 Wheat and 1 Sheep for 2 Wood?\n(5 + 12) = 17. 2 Wood = 18. Gain of 1. Not very good.\nMy best current strategy is leveraging Player 0's apparent need for Wood using my plentiful low-value resources.\n\nMaybe try to get a more valuable resource for my lower value ones.\nWhat if I offer a lot of low-value stuff for one high-value item?\nExample: 3 Wheat (15) for 1 Brick (27). Net +12. This would be a great trade for me. Player 0 values Wood highly based on past trades.\n\nGiven my low quantity of Wood, perhaps I should *acquire* Wood, not trade it away. And Player 0 accepted my last trades involving giving them Wood. My apologies, the last trades were *I received* Wood.\n*   1 Sheep -> 2 Wood (I gave Sheep, got Wood)\n*   1 Wheat -> 1 Wood (I gave Wheat, got Wood)\n\nSo, my strategy to acquire Wood using my lower-value resources has been successful. I should continue this.\n\nCan I get more Wood for Wheat? I have plenty of Wheat.\nOffer: 2 Wheat -> 2 Wood (10 -> 18). Net +8. This is good.\nThey previously accepted 1 Wheat -> 1 Wood (+4). Doubling the offer might be accepted.\n\nI will try to make the most profitable offer given all past interactions. Player 0 has continually shown that they value Wood highly. I have a lot of Wheat and Sheep.\n\nMy offer: 2 Wheat for 2 Wood.\nValue offered: 2 * 5 = 10\nValue requested: 2 * 9 = 18\nNet gain: 18 - 10 = +8\n\nThis is a better gain than my previous +4 and +6 trades.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 2 Wood]",

Player 1 made no new trade offer.' This means Player 0 *offered* 3 Sheep, 2 Ore and *requested* 5 Brick, 2 Sheep *from me*. This would have been a massive loss for me: (3*12 + 2*35) - (5*27 + 2*12) = (36+70) - (135+24) = 106 - 159 = -53. *This past move was a mistake according to my own rules if I was actually the one accepting this based on current values. However, the game state provided implies I already accepted it, so I operate from the new state.*\n    *   Player 0 rejected 4 Wood -> 2 Ore. (My gain: 2*35 - 4*9 = 70 - 36 = +34). This means P0 valued their 2 Ore more than 4 Wood, or they didn't have 2 Ore to give.\n    *   Player 0 accepted 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood. (My gain: 2*9 - 1*12 = 18 - 12 = +6). This indicates P0 valued 1 Sheep highly or needed it.\n    *   Player 0 accepted 1 Wheat -> 1 Wood. (My gain: 1*9 - 1*5 = 9 - 5 = +4). Small gain, P0 willing to trade 1 Wood for 1 Wheat.\n    *   Player 0 accepted 2 Wheat -> 2 Wood. (My gain: 2*9 - 2*5 = 18 - 10 = +8). Consistent with 1:1 Wheat:Wood.\n8.  **Leverage Knowledge of P0's preferences:** P0 seems willing to trade Wood for Wheat or Sheep. P0 rejected my request for Ore. This suggests P0 values Ore highly or is low on it. I have a lot of Wheat and Sheep. I am relatively low on Wood (quant. 8) but it's low value, so trading it for higher value goods is good. However, P0 is offering Wood. This is good for me if I can get it for cheap (e.g., Wheat).\n\nMy current goal should be to continue giving away low-value resources (Wheat, Sheep) for higher-value ones (Wood, Brick, Ore). Since P0 has shown willingness to trade Wood for my Wheat, that's a good direction. I want to avoid trading my high-value Brick and Ore unless the gain is substantial.\n\nMy current resources (after the first trade that I *accepted* from P0, meaning I gave 5 Brick, 2 Sheep and received 3 Sheep, 2 Ore):\nInitial: Wheat 23 (5), Wood 8 (9), Sheep 23 (12), Brick 25 (27), Ore 23 (35)\nP0 offered: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> Requested: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep (from me)\n\n*This is critical. If Player 1 *accepted* this, then P1 *gave* 5 Brick and 2 Sheep, and *received* 3 Sheep and 2 Ore.*\nLet's recalculate initial state based on the prompt's provided initial resource list. The history states I accepted this. So my new resources are:\n- Wheat: 23 (No change)\n- Wood: 8 (No change)\n- Sheep: 23 - 2 + 3 = 24 (Given 2, received 3)\n- Brick: 25 - 5 = 20 (Given 5)\n- Ore: 23 + 2 = 25 (Received 2)\n\n**My current state based on accepting P0's first offer:**\n- Wheat: 23 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 8 (Value: 9)\n- Sheep: 24 (Value: 12)\n- Brick: 20 (Value: 27)\n- Ore: 25 (Value: 35)\n\nTotal initial value: 23*5 + 8*9 + 23*12 + 25*27 + 23*35 = 115 + 72 + 276 + 675 + 805 = 1943\nTotal value after P0's first accepted offer: 23*5 + 8*9 + 24*12 + 20*27 + 25*35 = 115 + 72 + 288 + 540 + 875 = 1890\nNet value change: 1890 - 1943 = -53. This was a bad trade! I need to be more careful. Player 0 successfully duped me.\n\n**Subsequent trades from my perspective (as P1):**\n- P0 offered 4 Wood -> 2 Ore. I rejected. (My value gain: 2*35 - 4*9 = 70 - 36 = +34). This was a mistake to reject if P0 was the one offering (giving) 4 Wood and requesting 2 Ore (from me). Wait, \"P0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 4 Wood -> Requested items: 2 Ore\". This means P0 gives me 4 Wood, and wants 2 Ore from me. So I'd lose 2 Ore (value 70) and gain 4 Wood (value 36). Net loss of 34. *Rejecting this was correct.*\n\n- My offer: 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood.

Getting more Wood is okay if the price is right, but I want to convert low-value resources into high-value ones.\nP0 rejected my 4 Wood for 2 Ore (P0 offered 4 Wood for 2 Ore from me, meaning P0 was giving 4 Wood and I was giving 2 Ore), so P0 is probably stingy with their Ore.\n\nI should continue offering Wheat for Wood, as P0 seems to accept.\nAlternatively, I could try to get Brick or Ore for my Wheat/Sheep if I think P0 might accept.\nLet's try to slightly escalate the Wheat -> Wood trade.\nHow about 3 Wheat for 3 Wood? (My gain: 3*9 - 3*5 = 27 - 15 = +12). P0 accepted 2 Wheat for 2 Wood, so 3 for 3 is a direct extension. This is a safe move to increase value.\n\nOr, can I get better value for my Sheep? 1 Sheep for 2 Wood was +6.\nWhat about 2 Sheep for 3 Wood? (My gain: 3*9 - 2*12 = 27 - 24 = +3). Less efficient than 1 Sheep for 2 Wood.\nWhat about 1 Sheep for 1 Brick? (My gain: 1*27 - 1*12 = +15). This is a good trade for me, but P0 might not accept giving up a high-value resource for a medium-value one.\n\nLet's try to get a higher value resource. Perhaps 3 Wood for 1 Brick? (My gain: 1*27 - 3*9 = 27 - 27 = 0). Not good.\n\nI need to chip away at my low-value resources (Wheat, Sheep) for higher-value ones like Wood, Brick, or Ore.\nSince P0 seems happy to trade Wood for Wheat at 1:1, I can keep doing that for incremental gains.\nThere are 10 turns total, and I've finished a few. I need to be efficient.\n\nConsider: Offering 4 Wheat for 1 Brick. (My gain: 1*27 - 4*5 = 27 - 20 = +7). This is a good value trade for me, but P0 might not want to give up Brick for Wheat.\nHowever, P0 also accepted a trade where I gave Sheep and Ore to them for Brick and Sheep. This implies P0 values Brick. So maybe easier to get Brick?\n\nLet's try a trade for Brick. This gets me closer to recovering from that initial loss.\nMy current total value is 1908. Need to reach 1943+ to break even and then make profit.\n\nMy best strategy right now is to keep trading my lowest value resource (Wheat) for my second lowest (Wood) at a 1:1 ratio, as P0 has consistently accepted these. This accumulates positive value.\nI have 20 Wheat and 13 Wood. Increasing my Wood stock is good as it's a higher value per unit.\n\nLet's stick with what P0 has accepted before.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 3 Wood]\nMy gain: 3*9 - 3*5 = 27 - 15 = +12. This is a good incremental gain.\nThis continues the pattern of accepted trades.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"offer\", \"offered_items\": {\"Wheat\": 3}, \"requested_items\": {\"Wood\": 3}}\n```",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\n1. **Value Assessment**: Understanding the value of resources is key. Wheat, Wood, Sheep, Brick, and Ore have specific values. The strategy should involve trading lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n2. **Scarcity and Demand**: Resources may vary in demand among players depending on their current stock. Observing what Player 1 is trying to trade can provide insights into their priorities.\n\n3. **Negotiation Dynamics**: Building goodwill through accepting fair offers can create an environment for future trades. Rejecting too many offers may hamper potential opportunities.\n\n4. **Resource Distribution**: Balancing resources can prevent oversaturation of any single type and keep options open for future trades. \n\n### Trading Decision\n\nIn the current scenario, I have these resources:\n- Wheat: 5\n- Wood: 23\n- Sheep: 6\n- Brick: 12\n- Ore: 21\n\nGiven Player 1's last offer (3 Wheat for 3 Wood), I need to evaluate:\n\n- The value of the Wheat I currently possess (5 x 6 = 30).\n- The value of the Wood (23 x 11 = 253).\n\n**I am going to reject the offer from Player 1. Accepting it would decrease my resource value overall. Instead, I will analyze my inventory and look for ways to secure more high-value resources in future trades without depleting my Wheat too much.** \n\nThus, my decision is:\n- **[Deny]**: I deny Player 1's offer of 3 Wheat for 3 Wood in favor of maintaining my resource advantage.",
