      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: The value of each resource is fixed and known:\n   - Wheat: 6 (lowest value)\n   - Wood: 12\n   - Sheep: 18\n   - Brick: 21\n   - Ore: 40 (highest value)\n\n   This means Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and Wheat. I should prioritize acquiring high-value resources (especially Ore) and be cautious about giving them away.\n\n2. **Net Value Calculation**: Any trade should ideally increase the total value of my holdings. I can calculate the value of offered vs. requested resources:\n   - Offered value should be < Requested value to ensure a profitable trade.\n\n3. **Scarcity and Strategic Surplus**: I have:\n   - High Sheep (17) and Wood (21) \u2014 possibly surplus\n   - Moderate Wheat (11) and Brick (12)\n   - Low Ore (7) \u2014 but high value, so I may want to gain more\n\n   Since Ore is worth 40, even small gains in Ore could significantly boost my total value.\n\n4. **Trading Leverage**: I can use high-quantity, medium-value resources like Sheep and Wood to trade for higher-value resources like Ore or Brick. Willingness to trade Sheep could attract offers since it's moderately valuable but not top tier.\n\n5. **Trade Efficiency**: Aim for trades that maximize value gain per unit traded. For example, trading lower-value surplus for higher-value scarce resources is optimal.\n\n6. **Opponent Modeling (Indirect)**: Since other players also seek to increase their value, they may be looking to shed low-value resources to gain high-value ones. I can exploit this by demanding high-value resources in exchange for my surplus.\n\n7. **Offer Strategy**: Make offers that are beneficial to me but appear reasonable to others. Slight imbalances in value can be acceptable if they prompt acceptance.\n\n8. **Patience and Turn Limit**: With 10 turns, I should not rush. However, early value accumulation can compound. Balance aggression with selectivity.\n\nApplication of Knowledge:\n\nI currently have a large quantity of Wood (21) and Sheep (17), both lower in value than Brick and especially Ore. Ore is the most valuable resource (40), and I only have 7. Brick is also valuable (21), but I have 12\u2014moderate stock.\n\nIdeal trade: Exchange surplus Wood or Sheep for Ore.\n\nPossible Offer:\nOffer: 3 Sheep (3 \u00d7 18 = 54) and 2 Wood (2 \u00d7 12 = 24) \u2192 total offered: 78 value\nRequest: 2 Ore (2 \u00d7 40 = 80) \u2192 total requested: 80\n\nThis is a favorable trade: I gain 2 in net value.\n\nBut to increase chance of acceptance, make it slightly more appealing to the other side.\n\nAlternate (more attractive to trader):\nOffer: 4 Sheep (72) + 1 Wood (12) = 84 \u2192 Request: 2 Ore (80) \u2014 I lose 4 in value. Not ideal.\n\nBetter: Offer mix that gives slight edge to me.\n\nTry: 3 Sheep (54) + 1 Wood (12) = 66 \u2192 Request: 2 Brick (42) \u2014 terrible, I gain only 42 vs give 66.\n\nNot good.\n\nReverse perspective: What if I offer to give less and get more?\n\nI should request Ore.\n\nBest opportunity: Target Ore.\n\nTry this offer:\nOffer: 3 Sheep (54) \u2192 Request: 2 Ore (80)\nNet gain: +26 value\nBut opponent gives 80, I give 54 \u2014 highly favorable for me, unlikely accepted.\n\nToo aggressive.\n\nBalanced but favorable:\nOffer: 4 Sheep (72) \u2192 Request: 2 Ore (80)\nNet: +8 for me \u2014 still good, but more plausible.\n\nAlternatively, include a low-tier resource to sweeten offer:\nOffer: 3 Sheep (54) + 2 Wheat (12) = 66 \u2192 Request: 2 Ore (80)\nNet: +14 \u2014 excellent.\n\nBut I don't want to waste Wheat unless necessary.\n\nBetter: Use Wood, which I have 21 of.\n\nTry:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Ore]\n\nCalculate:\n- Offered: 3\u00d718 + 1\u00d712 = 54 + 12 = 66\n- Requested: 2\u00d740 = 80\n- Net gain: +14\n\nThis is efficient and uses surplus.\n\nBut perhaps too good \u2014 might not be accepted. But as a strategic offer, it sets a bar.\n\nAlternatively, target Brick? Brick is 21, I have 12 \u2014 but value is less than Ore.\n\nStill, if I can trade down: offer Sheep/Wood for Brick, then later trade Brick for Ore.\n\nBut direct Ore gain is best.\n\nGiven my surplus in Sheep and Wood, I will make an offer to acquire Ore.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Ore]",

Negotiation leverage  \n   \u2022 Due to my heavy high-value resources being scarce, I should intentionally appear more interested in acquiring Brick than Ore; Brick is slightly lower value than Ore, so Player 0 might undervalue it.  \n   \u2022 I can afford to part with up to 5 Sheep or 6\u20137 Wood without materially harming my stockpile.  \n   \u2022 I should bundle low-resource Wheat into \u201csweetener\u201d lots, but Wheat alone is undesirable, so pairing Wheat with Sheep/Wood increases likelihood of closure.\n\n5.

Let me recalculate.\n\nBetter deal: I request 5 Brick (125) + 2 Sheep (30 I pay and 30 I get, hence zero change) and give them 3 Sheep (45) and 2 Ore (66). Net: 125 \u2013 45 \u2013 66 = +14 to me (modest gain), showing generosity.\n\nNow flip so Brick\u2019s value is my target.  \nSimpler: I want 5 Brick & give 3 Sheep.\n\nLet me craft precisely:  \nI overpay slightly in Sheep vs. Brick (3\u00d715=45 vs 5\u00d725=125) but if I tag on 2 Ore it looks worse.

Dead-Weight-Endowment Effect Avoidance  \n   Because Wood value per unit (10) < Ore value per unit (33), I should be willing to move Wood whenever the return even roughly helps my Brick/Ore count.\n\n5. Strategic Repetition & Timing  \n   We are at Turn 5 of 10.  No trade has gone through yet.  The offers so far were all slightly lopsided\u2014in Player 0\u2019s favor regarding the high-value Ore.  \n   A fresh offer that materially improves my Brick or Ore count is now necessary; over-valuing my Sheep or under-valuing my Wood has gotten prior offers rejected.\n\nHere is a new, more balanced offer\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: The value of each resource is static and known: Ore (40) > Brick (21) > Sheep (18) > Wood (12) > Wheat (6). Therefore, acquiring higher-value resources (especially Ore) increases total value most efficiently.\n\n2. **Net Value Gain Principle**: A trade is favorable if the total value of requested resources exceeds the total value of offered resources. Always calculate the value delta before accepting or making an offer.\n\n3. **Scarcity and Leverage**: You have abundant Wood (21) and moderate Sheep (17) and Brick (12). Ore is scarce (7) and high-value\u2014others may want it, but you should be reluctant to give it away cheaply. High-value resources should be acquired, not traded away unless receiving superior value in return.\n\n4. **Trade Efficiency**: Aim for trades where you receive high-value resources (Ore, Brick) in exchange for lower-value surplus (Wood, Sheep, Wheat). Avoid trades where you give up high-value resources unless net gain is significant.\n\n5. **Opponent Behavior Analysis**: Player 1 has repeatedly offered Sheep in exchange for Brick and Ore. This suggests they value Brick and Ore and may be willing to trade larger quantities of Sheep or Wood to get them. They appear eager to acquire Ore.\n\n6. **Strategic Timing**: With 10 turns total and several rounds already passed with no successful trades, it\u2019s crucial to make a compelling, value-positive offer now to break the deadlock before time runs out.\n\n7. **Offer Framing**: Propose trades that appear balanced or slightly favorable to the opponent but still net you value gain. For example, offering Wood (lower value) for Ore (high value) is ideal if the opponent undervalues Wood or needs it urgently.\n\nEvaluate Player 1's Last Offer:\n- Offered: 4 Wood (4 \u00d7 12 = 48)\n- Requested: 1 Ore (40) + 1 Brick (21) = 61\n- Net value for Player 0: +13 (61 - 48)\nThis is a **favorable offer**\u2014you gain 13 value.\n\nBut you rejected it.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: What key principles, strategies, or insights about resource trading and negotiation are most relevant to your current situation?\n\n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: The value of each resource is fixed and known: Ore (40) > Brick (21) > Sheep (18) > Wood (12) > Wheat (6). Therefore, acquiring higher-value resources (especially Ore and Brick) generally increases total resource value more efficiently.\n\n2. **Personal Resource Abundance and Opportunity Cost**: I have abundant Wood (21) and Brick (12), and medium levels of Sheep (17) and Wheat (11), but scarce Ore (7). Since Ore is the most valuable, prioritizing trades that gain Ore is beneficial. However, giving up too much Brick or Wood without sufficient return may not be wise.\n\n3. **Trade Efficiency and Net Value Gain**: A good trade increases total resource value. Always evaluate the net change in total value:\n   - Value of Requested Resources \u2013 Value of Offered Resources = Net Value Change\n   - Positive net change = favorable; negative or zero = unfavorable unless strategic.\n\n4. **Bluffing and Strategic Denial**: Other players may overvalue or undervalue resources. Rejecting unfair offers conditions opponents to improve their deals. Accepting occasional low-gain or break-even trades can build goodwill for better future offers.\n\n5. **Scarcity and Perceived Demand**: If a player keeps offering Sheep (as Player 1 did), they may have excess Sheep and desperately need Brick or Ore. This signals that I can demand more favorable terms when trading Brick or Ore.\n\n6. **Resource Utility Beyond Value**: In many similar games (e.g., Settlers of Catan), Brick and Wood are early-game resources, while Ore is crucial for late-game advancement. Given that 10 turns are available and we're likely mid-game, acquiring Ore now may offer greater long-term advantage.\n\n7. **Track Opponent Behavior**: Player 1 has repeatedly offered Sheep (first 3, then 5) and now Wood, always requesting Ore and/or Brick. This suggests scarcity of Brick and Ore on their part. They may be willing to trade larger quantities of lower-value resources to get what I have.\n\n8. **Accepting the Last Trade (4 Wood \u2192 1 Ore, 1 Brick)**:\n   - Offered: 4 Wood = 4 \u00d7 12 = 48 value\n   - Received: 1 Ore (40) + 1 Brick (21) = 61 value\n   - Net Gain: +13 \u2014 a favorable trade. This confirms that Player 1 is willing to provide positive value trades for resources I can afford to give up.\n\nNow, evaluating the current offer from Player 1:\n  - Offered: 6 Wheat, 5 Wood \u2192 Requested: 2 Brick, 1 Ore\n  - Value of what I give: 6 Wheat (6\u00d76=36) + 5 Wood (5\u00d712=60) = 96\n  - Value of what I receive: 2 Brick (2\u00d721=42) + 1 Ore (40) = 82\n  - Net Value Change: 82 \u2013 96 = -14 \u2192 **value loss of 14**\n\nThis is an unfavorable trade. I would be giving up high quantities of lower-value but useful resources (especially Wood, already being traded) for less total value.\n\nAdditionally:\n- Wheat is my lowest-value resource (6), but I only have 11. Giving up 6 is over half my stock, with limited surplus.\n- Wood is moderately high (21), but after already trading 4 Wood earlier, giving up 5 more reduces my buffer.\n- Getting only 1 Ore and 2 Brick (82 value) for 96 value in return is bad economics.\n\n**Strategic Insight**: Player 1 may be trying to exploit my willingness to trade Wood and Wheat by bundling large quantities to get higher-value items. This should be resisted unless the net value is positive or there is strategic benefit (e.g., stockpiling for a critical threshold). No such benefit is evident.\n\nTherefore, the rational decision is to deny this offer.\n\n[Deny]",
