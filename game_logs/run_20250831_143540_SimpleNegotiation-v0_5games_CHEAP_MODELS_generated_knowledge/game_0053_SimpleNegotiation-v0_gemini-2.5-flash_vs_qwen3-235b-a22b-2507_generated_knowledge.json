      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This means I should aim to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or trade resources I have in surplus for those that are more valuable and I might be lacking.\n2.  **Resource Values:**\n    *   Wheat: 5\n    *   Wood: 8\n    *   Sheep: 13\n    *   Brick: 22\n    *   Ore: 35\n    Clearly, Ore and Brick are the most valuable, followed by Sheep, Wood, and Wheat.\n3.  **Current Inventory Analysis:**\n    *   Wheat: 21 (Highest quantity, lowest value) - Good candidate for offering.\n    *   Wood: 12 (Mid-quantity, low value) - Also a candidate for offering if needed.\n    *   Sheep: 19 (High quantity, mid-value) - Potentially tradable, especially for Brick or Ore.\n    *   Brick: 18 (High quantity, high value) - Want to keep these or acquire more.\n    *   Ore: 11 (Lowest quantity, highest value) - Want to acquire more of these.\n4.  **Trading Strategy - Value Maximization:**\n    *   Prioritize acquiring Ore and Brick.\n    *   Prioritize offering Wheat and Wood.\n    *   Consider offering Sheep for Brick or Ore if the exchange is favorable.\n    *   Only offer Brick or Ore if the return is significantly higher in total value, or if it facilitates a larger strategic advantage (e.g., getting multiple high-value resources for one).\n5.  **Batches and Ratios:**\n    *   The value differences are significant. I should aim for favorable exchange ratios. For example, 1 Ore (35) is worth more than 7 Wheat (35) or 4 Wood (32).\n    *   A 1:1 trade of Wheat for anything else (especially high-value) is excellent.\n    *   A 1:1 trade of Wood for Sheep, Brick, or Ore is excellent.\n    *   A 1:1 trade of Sheep for Brick or Ore is good.\n6.  **Opening Offer Strategy:**\n    *   Start with an offer that is clearly beneficial to me, but not so aggressive that it will be immediately rejected. I have a lot of Wheat and Sheep.\n    *   Consider offering a bundle of low-value resources for a single high-value resource, or a few mid-value resources for a few high-value resources.\n    *   Need to consider what the other player *might* want. Since I don't know their inventory, a general appeal to \"more quantity\" (e.g., my Wheat) for \"higher quality\" (their whatever they might have more of) could work.\n7.  **Maintaining Flexibility:** Don't overcommit in one offer. Keep options open for subsequent turns. Since it's turn 1 of 10, there's room to negotiate.\n\nApplying Knowledge:\nMy goal is to increase total value. Wheat and Wood are the least valuable resources I have. Ore and Brick are the most valuable. I have a lot of Wheat and Sheep. I want more Ore and Brick.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat and/or Sheep for Brick or Ore.\n\nOption 1: Offer a significant amount of Wheat for some Ore/Brick.\nExample: 10 Wheat (50 value) for 2 Brick (44 value) or 1 Ore (35 value). This doesn't look like a good trade for me if I'm offering 10 Wheat. I'd need more for 10 Wheat. How about 10 Wheat for 1 Ore and 1 Brick? (50 value offered for 57 value received). This is good for me. Player 0 has abundant Wheat.\n\nOption 2: Offer Sheep for Brick/Ore.\nExample: 3 Sheep (39 value) for 1 Brick (22 value) + 1 Sheep (13 value)? That's just 35 value received. Not good.\nHow about 3 Sheep (39 value) for 2 Brick (44 value)? Good for me.\nHow about 4 Sheep (52 value) for 2 Ore (70 value)? Very good for me.\n\nGiven my high quantity of Wheat and Sheep, an initial offer exchanging a moderate amount of these for higher value resources seems a good starting point.\n\nLet's try: Offer a decent chunk of Wheat and some Sheep for Brick/Ore.\n\nMy highest quantity low-value resource is Wheat. My highest quantity mid-value resource is Sheep.\nI want Ore and Brick.\n\nConsider an offer like:\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 5 * 5 + 3 * 13 = 25 + 39 = 64\nValue requested: 1 * 22 + 1 * 35 = 22 + 35 = 57\nThis is *negative* for me. I need to get more value than I give.\n\nLet's reverse it. Request more value from a single item.\nHow about offering a good amount of my less valuable resources for a single, high-value resource from them?\n\nWhat if I offer 5 Wheat and 2 Sheep for 1 Ore?\n5 Wheat (25) + 2 Sheep (26) = 51 value offered.\n1 Ore = 35 value received. Still not good for me.\n\nI need to be gaining value.\nLet's try to trade low-value for high-value.\nI have 21 Wheat and 19 Sheep.\nI want Ore (35) or Brick (22).\n\nOffer: [Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nValue Offered: 7 * 5 = 35\nValue Received: 1 * 22 = 22\nStill negative for me.\n\nThis means my resources are generally cheaper, so I need to offer more quantity to get something.\nI must offer enough to be appealing to the other player, while still making a profit.\n\nWhat if I offer my cheapest resource (Wheat) for their most expensive (Ore, assuming they have it)?\nExample: [Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 10 * 5 = 50\nValue requested: 1 * 35 = 35\nStill not profitable for me.\n\nOkay, I need to restructure my thinking. My resources are generally lower value. I need to offer *more* of my lower value items for *less* of their higher value items, yet the total value received *must* be greater than the total value offered.\n\nLet's go for value-for-value.\nI want to target Ore first.\nTarget: 1 Ore (35 value).\nWhat can I offer that is less than 35 value but attractive?\nCan I offer 2 Sheep (26) + 1 Wood (8) = 34 value for 1 Ore (35 value)? This is a very small gain.\n\nLet me try to exchange resources I have a lot of (Wheat, Sheep) for resources I want (Ore, Brick).\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\nValue Offered: 2 * 8 + 3 * 13 = 16 + 39 = 55\nValue Requested: 2 * 22 = 44\nStill losing value. This is difficult without knowing the other player's inventory.\n\nMy strategy needs to be offering resources I have in surplus (Wheat, Sheep) for higher value resources.\nThe current set ratios (4:1 for specific resources in Catan) don't apply as there are no banks, so I can try for better.\n\nLet's consider an offer that leverages my high Wheat quantity aggressively.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]\nValue Offered: 10 * 5 = 50\nValue Requested: 2 * 13 = 26\nThis is a huge loss for me.\n\nLet's focus on a deal where I give many low-value and get one high-value.\nWhat about offering 10 Wheat (50 value) for 2 Brick (44 value)? No.\n\nI need to focus on *profit*.\nMaybe an offer of 2 Sheep (26 value) for 1 Brick (22 value) + something else? No, still negative.\n\nI need to gain value.\nHow about offering my *second* least valuable (Wood) and my *most abundant* (Wheat) for something valuable?\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep, 1 Brick]\nValue Offered: 5*5 + 2*8 = 25 + 16 = 41\nValue Requested: 1*13 + 1*22 = 13 + 22 = 35\nStill losing value! My values are higher than the opponent's usually.\n\nOkay, I need an offer where offered value < requested value.\n\nLet's try to offer Sheep for Ore. I have 19 Sheep and 11 Ore.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue Offered: 3 * 13 = 39\nValue Requested: 1 * 35 = 35\nStill losing value.\n\nThis implies I must offer a *smaller total value* amount of resources to receive a *larger total value* amount.\nMy values are: Wheat 5, Wood 8, Sheep 13, Brick 22, Ore 35.\n\nLet's try this: I have 21 Wheat.\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Wood]\nValue Offered: 4 * 5 = 20\nValue Requested: 1 * 8 = 8\nHuge loss.\n\nThis setup indicates that I inherently have resources that are \"cheaper\" to the system or my values are inflated compared to what I must offer to gain.\nThe only way to win is to trade for \"more\" points.\nLet me target Brick (22) or Ore (35).\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]\nValue Offered: 1*13 + 1*8 = 21\nValue Requested: 1*22 = 22\nThis gains me 1 value point! This is a very small profit, but it's a profit.\nI have plenty of Sheep and Wood. This is a possibility.\n\nWhat about a slightly larger gain?\n[Offer: 1 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]\nValue Offered: 1*8 + 2*5 = 18\nValue Requested: 1*13 = 13\nThis is a loss.\n\nLet's stick to the principle of \"offer cheap, get expensive value\".\nTarget: 1 Ore (35) or 1 Brick (22).\n\nAttempt Offer: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nValue Offered: 2 Sheep = 2 * 13 = 26\nValue Requested: 1 Brick = 22\nStill a loss.\n\nThis is counter-intuitive if the goal is to make my resources worth more.\nI must be trading my *lower value* resources for *higher value* resources, where the *sum of values* of the resources I receive is greater than the *sum of values* of the resources I offer.\n\nGiven Wheat (5) and Wood (8) are my cheapest, I need to get rid of them for anything else.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wheat for a single, slightly more valuable item?\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Wood]\nValue Offered: 3 * 5 = 15\nValue Requested: 1 * 8 = 8\nStill losing.\n\nThe only way to make a profit in this setup, if my initial offers were all losing value, is to offer *fewer* resources than I receive, or resources that add up to a lower sum.\nLet's re-evaluate the calculation:\n**Value Offered < Value Received**\n\nConsider a trade that moves my most abundant, lowest value resource (Wheat) for anything else that is higher value.\nI have 21 Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 1 Wheat -> 1 Wood]\nValue Offered: 5\nValue Received: 8\nThis is a gain of 3 points! I have 21 Wheat and 12 Wood. This is a profitable trade for me.\nThe other player (assuming they want Wheat) might accept this to increase their Wood. This is my best approach for Turn 1.\n\nAction:\n[Offer: 1 Wheat -> 1 Wood]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \nIn resource trading games, the key to increasing total value lies in exploiting relative scarcities, valuing resources based on both personal utility and market dynamics, and leveraging negotiation to obtain higher-value resources in exchange for lower-value ones.  \n\nKey principles applicable here:  \n1. **Resource Value Asymmetry**: Evaluate trades based on the value *to you* versus the value to the other player. Since your goal is to maximize the total value of your own resources, prioritize acquiring high-value items (like Ore, valued at 40) and minimize giving them away. Conversely, be cautious about overaccumulating lower-value resources unless they\u2019re in surplus or useful for upcoming trades.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost**: Consider what you're giving up. Sheep are worth 12 each\u2014moderately valuable\u2014and you have 25, which is substantial. Wheat is low value (5), and you already have 15. Giving away Sheep for low-value returns isn\u2019t efficient.\n\n3. **Trade Efficiency**: Aim for favorable trade ratios. Receiving 1 Brick (value 26) and 1 Ore (value 40) totals 66 in incoming value. In return, giving 5 Wheat (5\u00d75=25) and 3 Sheep (3\u00d712=36) totals 61 in outgoing value. On pure value, this is *slightly favorable* (gain of 5 value), but consider:\n   - You have surplus Brick (25) and Ore (23)\u2014giving up 1 of each won\u2019t hurt.\n   - You gain 5 low-value Wheat (you already have 15; likely surplus).\n   - You give up 3 Sheep (36 value) for only 26+40 = 66 incoming, but you're adding low-value Wheat which may clog inventory without strategic benefit.\n\n4. **Strategic Inventory Management**: Accumulating high-value resources (Ore, Brick) is ideal. Avoid trades that dump moderately valuable resources (Sheep) for items you already have in surplus (Wheat, Brick via indirect gain?).\n\nWait\u2014clarify the trade:  \nPlayer 0 offers *to you*: **5 Wheat, 3 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick, 1 Ore**  \nSo:  \n- You *give*: 1 Brick, 1 Ore  \n- You *receive*: 5 Wheat, 3 Sheep  \n\nThat\u2019s the reverse.  \n\nSo revised:  \nYou **receive**: 5 Wheat (5\u00d75=25), 3 Sheep (3\u00d712=36) \u2192 Total incoming value: 61  \nYou **give**: 1 Brick (26), 1 Ore (40) \u2192 Total outgoing value: 66  \n\nYou **lose 5 net value** in this trade.  \nMoreover, you already have:  \n- 15 Wheat (low value, surplus likely)  \n- 25 Sheep (plenty)  \n- 25 Brick, 23 Ore (high-value, in large supply)\n\nGiving up 1 Brick and 1 Ore (total 66) to gain 5 Wheat and 3 Sheep (total 61) is a **net loss in value** and increases lower-tier resources you already have in abundance.\n\nAdditionally, depleting Ore and Brick\u2014your highest-value resources\u2014for marginal gains in low-tier resources is suboptimal unless there's a strategic reason (e.g., freeing up space, but no inventory cap mentioned).\n\nAlso, since the game lasts 10 turns, early trades should set up dominance in high-value resources, not dilute them.\n\nTherefore, the offer is unfavorable.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n*   **Focus on high-value trades:** Prioritize acquiring resources that have a higher value per unit, especially Ore and Brick. Trading away lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for higher-value ones is a good strategy.\n*   **Identify surplus resources:** I have a significant quantity of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep. These are good candidates for trading away, especially if the return is valuable.\n*   **Identify deficit resources:** My quantity of Ore is relatively low compared to other resources, but its high value makes it a key resource to acquire or hold onto. Brick is also valuable and I have a decent quantity, but acquiring more can further increase my total value.\n*   **Calculate value exchange:** For any proposed trade, calculate the total value of resources offered versus the total value of resources requested. Only make trades where `Value(Requested Resources) > Value(Offered Resources)`.\n*   **Consider player needs/strategies (inference):** Player 1 rejected my previous offer, which involved trading Wheat and Sheep for Brick and Ore.

I need to be more strategic.\n*   **Be patient but proactive:** While waiting for good offers, I should continue to make offers that are advantageous to me.\n*   **Small, mutually beneficial steps:** If large, ambitious trades fail, perhaps consider smaller trades or trades that offer a slightly less aggressive value gain for me, but still positive, to see if Player 1 is more receptive.\n\nCurrent Resources:\n*   Wheat: 21 (Value: 5) = 105\n*   Wood: 12 (Value: 8) = 96\n*   Sheep: 19 (Value: 13) = 247\n*   Brick: 18 (Value: 22) = 396\n*   Ore: 11 (Value: 35) = 385\nTotal Value: 1229\n\nTrading Decision:\nMy previous offer was flawed. I need to offer less value for more value. Player 1 rejected my offer of 64 value for 57 value, which was sensible from their side. I want to acquire more Brick and Ore as they are high value. I have a lot of Wheat and Sheep. Let's try to offload some Wheat and Wood, which are my lowest value resources, for Brick or Ore.\n\nAttempt 1: Trade a large quantity of low-value resource for a high-value resource.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (25) + 3 Wood (24) = 49 value\nRequest: 1 Brick (22) + 1 Ore (35) = 57 value.\nThis is a gain of 8 value for me. Might be too ambitious.\n\nAttempt 2: Trade a large quantity of low-value resource for a medium-high quantity of high-value.\nOffer: 7 Wheat (35)\nRequest: 1 Brick (22) + 1 Wood (8) = 30 value. (Net loss for me) - No.\n\nLet's rethink based on Player 1's rejection. They are likely looking for a gain, or at least parity. I should still aim for a gain.\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of low-value resources for a single high-value resource?\n\nOffer: 8 Wheat (40)\nRequest: 1 Ore (35)\nThis is a loss for me. Not good.\n\nOffer: 2 Wood (16) + 2 Sheep (26) = 42\nRequest: 1 Ore (35) + 1 Wheat (5) = 40 (Loss for me!)\n\nI need to offer less of my value for more of their value.\nConsider my surplus: Wheat (21), Sheep (19).\nConsider my desired resources: Brick (22), Ore (35).\n\nLet's try to shed Wheat and acquire Brick or Ore.\nOffer: 4 Wheat (20) + 2 Wood (16) = 36 value\nRequest: 1 Ore (35)\nThis is close to even. Might be acceptable, and allows me to convert lower value resources into high value.\n\nLet's try with Sheep. Sheep is valuable, but not as valuable as Brick or Ore.\nOffer: 2 Sheep (26)\nRequest: 1 Brick (22)\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nI need to make an offer where requested value > offered value.\nLet's try a smaller quantity of low-value resources for high-value.\n\nOffer: 3 Wheat (15) + 3 Wood (24) = 39 value\nRequest: 1 Ore (35)\nStill a loss.\n\nOkay, let's make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me but not outrageously so. Player 1 may be looking to convert high-volume, low-value resources for higher-value ones. I have a lot of Wheat and Wood.\n\nOffer: 4 Wheat (20) + 2 Wood (16) = 36 value\nRequest: 1 Brick (22) and 1 Sheep (13) = 35 value? No, still a loss of value for me.\n\nThe key is that I want to increase my *total value*.\nSo, value(requested) > value(offered).\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat and Wood for Ore.\nMy current Ore is 11, valued at 35. Brick is 18, valued at 22.\n\nOffer: 5 Wheat (25) + 2 Wood (16) = 41\nRequest: 1 Ore (35) + 1 Wheat (5) = 40 (Still a loss!)\n\nThis is harder than it looks to make a positive value trade that the other player might accept.\n\nLet's revise my understanding of the previous rejection. My previous offer was a net loss *for me*. Player 1 rejected it. This implies Player 1 is also trying to gain value, or at least not lose value. So I need to make an offer that is *slightly* favorable to me but also allows for a perception of a gain for P1, or at least a balanced trade where P1 gets needed resources.\n\nI have 21 Wheat (low value). I have 12 Wood (low-medium value).\nI want more Brick (high value) and Ore (very high value).\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of very low value for a smaller quantity of high value?\nOffer: 7 Wheat (35)\nRequest: 1 Ore (35)\nThis is an even trade. Player 1 might accept it if they need Wheat and have excess Ore. I still convert a high quantity of low-value resource into a low quantity of high-value resource, simplifying my inventory.\n\nLet's try this.\nOffer: 7 Wheat (35) -> 1 Ore (35)\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "[Deny]  \n\n**Generate Knowledge:**\n\n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: The value of each resource is fixed and known:  \n   - Wheat: 5  \n   - Wood: 8  \n   - Sheep: 12  \n   - Brick: 26  \n   - Ore: 40  \n   This means Ore is the most valuable resource per unit, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and Wheat. Trading should aim to acquire higher-value resources or offload lower-value ones if surplus.\n\n2. **Net Value Change**: Any trade should be evaluated based on the net change in total resource value. Accepting a trade that gives away high-value resources for lower-value ones decreases net worth and should be avoided unless strategic (e.g., scarcity, future trades).\n\n3. **Opportunity Cost & Scarcity**: Although values are fixed, having large quantities of a resource may reduce its marginal utility to you, making it more suitable for trade. Conversely, holding scarce but high-value resources (like Ore at 40 value) increases leverage.\n\n4. **Trade Leverage**: With 23 Ore (highest value resource), you hold significant leverage. Players likely need Ore, so you should generally *request* Ore rather than give it away unless receiving fair or excess value in return.\n\n5. **Exploiting Imbalances**: The current offer from Player 0 (7 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore) implies they are willing to trade 7\u00d7Wheat (7\u00d75 = 35 value) for 1\u00d7Ore (40 value). This is nearly fair but slightly in your favor *if* you have excess Wheat. However, you only have 15 Wheat, which is moderate, and you are not in urgent need to trade down.\n\n6. **Strategic Offering**: Since you rejected Player 0\u2019s offer, you have the chance to make a counteroffer. You should aim to acquire more Ore or Brick while giving up lower-value surpluses. You have large quantities of Sheep (25) and Brick (25), which may be good trade commodities.\n\n7. **Avoid Giving Away Ore**: You currently have 23 Ore \u2014 a very high-value stockpile. You should **never** give Ore unless receiving equal or greater value in return (e.g., multiple Bricks or several high-value resources).\n\n8. **Mutual Benefit Principle**: Successful trades in multi-turn games often require appearing fair. Offers that are too one-sided will be rejected. A slightly favorable but plausible offer increases acceptance chance.\n\n---\n\nGiven Player 0\u2019s offer: **7 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore**,  \nValue given to you: 7\u00d75 = 35  \nValue you give up: 1\u00d740 = 40  \n\u2192 You lose 5 value. **Not favorable.** Thus, [Deny] is correct.\n\nNow, make a counteroffer that leverages your surplus (e.g. Sheep, Brick) to acquire more Ore or Wheat if needed.\n\nYou have 25 Sheep \u2014 high quantity, value 12 \u2014 good for trading.  \nYou also have 25 Brick \u2014 very high, value 26 \u2014 possibly more than needed.  \nYou have only 7 Wood \u2014 low, but not requested.  \nYou have 23 Ore \u2014 very valuable, keep or trade only at premium.\n\nPlayer 0 seems to want Ore (asked for 1 Ore in both offers) and has Wheat to spare.\n\nYou could offer a bundle of lower-value items to get Ore.\n\nFor example: Offer 3 Sheep (3\u00d712=36) + 2 Wheat (2\u00d75=10) = 46 value \u2192 for 1 Ore (40 value). Slightly in your favor, but plausible.\n\nBut better: Use moderate surplus to *request* Ore.\n\n**Best move**: Make an offer that gives medium-value resources in exchange for Ore, maximizing your total value.\n\nTry: **[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**\n\n- Value given: 5\u00d712 = 60  \n- Value received: 1\u00d740 = 40 \u2192 unfavorable to you.\n\nToo expensive.\n\nReverse: **Offer: 1 Ore -> 5 Sheep**? That would be giving high value for lower \u2014 no.\n\nBetter: **Request Ore, offer Brick or Wheat+Sheep combo**.\n\nBut Brick is 26 \u2014 very valuable. Don\u2019t give unless getting Ore.\n\nCan you offer 1 Brick (26) + 1 Sheep (12) = 38 \u2192 for 1 Ore (40)? Close, slightly favorable for other player.\n\nOr: **2 Sheep (24) + 1 Wheat (5) = 29 \u2192 for 1 Brick (26)**? Could work if you need Brick, but you already have 25.\n\nNo need.\n\nBetter: You don\u2019t need more Brick or Wheat. You want **Ore**.\n\nSo: Offer something that targets Player 0\u2019s surplus.\n\nPlayer 0 has offered **7 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore**, so they likely have excess Wheat and want Ore.\n\nSo, **they want Ore**. You have Ore \u2014 use it as leverage only if getting more than 40 value in return.\n\nBut no resource is worth more than 40. So only way is to trade 1 Ore for multiple items.\n\nFor example: **Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick, 3 Sheep**  \nValue: give 40, get 2\u00d726 + 3\u00d712 = 52 + 36 = 88 \u2192 great for you, but no one would accept.\n\nUnrealistic.\n\nBetter: Trade **Sheep and Wheat** \u2014 which you have in quantity \u2014 for **Ore**.\n\nTry: **Offer: 6 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore**  \nValue: give 6\u00d712 + 5 = 72 + 5 = 77 \u2192 get 40 \u2192 too costly.\n\nNo.\n\nSo **direct trade for Ore** will always require giving more *quantity-value* unless other player is desperate.\n\nAlternatively: maybe **get Wood**? You only have 7, value 8. But not requested.\n\nBest insight: **You should not give Ore. You should acquire it.**\n\nSo, make an offer that gives surplus (e.g. Sheep or Wheat) for resources that are high-value and you have less of \u2014 but you already have high Ore.\n\nWait: Your total value is:\n- Wheat: 15\u00d75 = 75\n- Wood: 7\u00d78 = 56\n- Sheep: 25\u00d712 = 300\n- Brick: 25\u00d726 = 650\n- Ore: 23\u00d740 = 920  \nTotal = 75+56+300+650+920 = **2001**\n\nYour main surpluses: **Sheep (25), Brick (25)** \u2014 both high quantity.\n\nBrick and Ore are most valuable per unit.\n\nBut if you have excess Brick, you could trade Brick for Ore \u2014 but Ore is more valuable, so trade 2 Brick (52) \u2192 for 1 Ore (40) would be loss.\n\nSo again, hard to trade up.\n\nBut perhaps **Player 0 undervalues their Wheat** and wants Ore badly.\n\nSo you can exploit that by offering **modest value** to get Ore.\n\nBut you must avoid losing value.\n\nAlternatively: **Do not trade unless gain in value or strategic positioning.**\n\nBut game objective: *increase total value of your resources*.\n\nSo only **positive net value** trades.\n\nThus: Only accept offers where total value received > value given.\n\nFor your own offers: Offer lower-value bundles for higher-value returns.\n\nBest bet: Offer something like **5 Sheep (60) and 5 Wheat (25) \u2192 2 Ore (80)**  \nNet gain: 80 - 85 = -5 \u2192 still loss.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, no: you give 85, get 80 \u2192 loss.\n\nTo gain value, you need to **receive more than you give**.\n\nSo: Offer **5 Wheat, 2 Sheep (5\u00d75 + 2\u00d712 = 25+24=49)** \u2192 Request **1 Brick (26)**  \nValue given: 49, received: 26 \u2192 loss.\n\nAlways hard.\n\nBut if you have surplus, and other player needs it, maybe they accept giving more value.\n\nSo **flip**: you can offer **1 Brick (26)** \u2192 Request **1 Sheep, 1 Wheat** (12+5=17) \u2192 you lose value.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait \u2014 only **accept offers where you gain net value**.\n\nOr, make offers where **they give more value than they take**.\n\nExample: You offer 1 Brick (26) \u2192 Request 2 Sheep (24). You gain 2 value. Small but positive.\n\nAnd since you have 25 Brick, losing 1 is fine if gaining 2 units of 12-value.\n\nBut in this case, 2 Sheep = 24, Brick=26 \u2192 you lose 2.\n\nReverse: Offer 2 Sheep (24) \u2192 Request 1 Brick (26): you gain 2 value.\n\nYes.\n\nSo **Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick**  \nValue: give 24, get 26 \u2192 **+2 value**\n\nYou have 25 Sheep \u2014 can spare 2.\n\nYou have 25 Brick already, but more increases total value.\n\nIs it worth it? Yes \u2014 **net value increase**.\n\nBut Player 0 may not have Brick.\n\nThey haven\u2019t shown interest.\n\nAlternatively: You have 23 Ore \u2014 most valuable.\n\nCan you trade 1 Ore (40) for, say, 1 Brick (26) and 1 Sheep (12) = 38 \u2192 you lose 2.\n\nNo.\n\nOr 1 Ore \u2192 2 Brick: 52 value? Then you gain 12.\n\nBut would they accept?\n\nUnlikely.\n\nBack: best is to **target low-value to high-value per unit trades**.\n\nSheep (12) \u2192 Brick (26): need to give < 2 Sheep for 1 Brick to gain.\n\nSo: **Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick** \u2192 gives them 24 value, you get 26 \u2192 +2.\n\nPlausible.\n\nBut you have 25 Sheep \u2014 very high.\n\nEven **Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick** \u2192 you give 36, get 26 \u2192 loss. No.\n\nSo only **2:1 (Sheep:Brick)** is break-even or better.\n\n2 Sheep = 24, Brick = 26 \u2192 **+2 for you**.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut do you want more Brick? You have 25, but value is 26 \u2014 high. More is better for total value.\n\nYes.\n\nLikewise: **Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick**: give 15+12=27, get 26 \u2192 loss of 1.\n\nClose, but loss.\n\nBetter to keep.\n\nAlternative: **Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Wood**: give 12, get 8 \u2192 loss.\n\nNo.\n\nSo **Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick** is best.\n\nBut let\u2019s see Player 0\u2019s behavior: they offered 7 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore.\n\nThey are willing to give up lots of low-value (Wheat) for high-value (Ore).\n\nSo they may be undervaluing Wheat.\n\nYou have 15 Wheat \u2014 moderate.\n\nCan you use that?\n\nOffer: **5 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick** \u2192 give 25+12=37, get 26 \u2192 loss.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps **request Ore** by offering combo they can\u2019t refuse.\n\nBut only if net positive.\n\nImpossible to trade below 40 value to get 40-value item.\n\nUnless they trade 1 Ore for <40 value \u2014 which they won\u2019t.\n\nSo best: **small efficient trades** that increase value by a few points.\n\nBack to **Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick**  \nValue: 24 \u2192 26 \u2192 +2\n\nFeasible.\n\nBut you have 25 Brick already \u2014 maybe not urgent.\n\nAlternatively, **request Wood**? You have only 7, Wood is 8 value.\n\nBut hard to get.\n\nWait \u2014 better idea: **you have low Wood (7)**, and it\u2019s worth 8 \u2014 not bad.\n\nBut no offers involve Wood.\n\nPlayer 0 may not care.\n\nBest: **wait for better offers**, or make a **value-neutral or +1, +2 value** trade.\n\nBut game lasts 10 turns \u2014 you should trade early and often.\n\nAnother idea: **you have 25 Sheep \u2014 extremely high**. Possibly more than needed.\n\nSo offload Sheep for higher-value items.\n\nBest ratio: **2 Sheep (24) -> 1 Brick (26)**: gain +2.\n\nYes.\n\nYou also have 15 Wheat \u2014 okay, not high.\n\nSo: make offer.\n\n**[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]**",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Understand Your Current Value:** My total current value is (21 * 5) + (12 * 8) + (19 * 13) + (18 * 22) + (11 * 35) = 105 + 96 + 247 + 396 + 385 = 1229. The goal is to increase this.\n2.  **Resource Values:** Ore (35) > Brick (22) > Sheep (13) > Wood (8) > Wheat (5). My priority should generally be to acquire higher-value resources and divest lower-value ones, especially those I have in abundance.\n3.  **Identify Surplus/Deficit:** I have a lot of Wheat (21) and Sheep (19). I have the least Ore (11) and Wood (12). Brick (18) is in a moderate quantity.\n4.  **Target High-Value Resources (Ore, Brick):** My previous offers tried to get Ore. This is a good strategy as it has the highest value. Brick is also valuable.\n5.  **Be Strategic with Offers:**\n    *   **\"Cheap\" Resources for \"Expensive\" Resources:** Offer resources I have in surplus and low value (Wheat, Sheep) for resources I lack and are high value (Ore, Brick).\n    *   **Value Proposition:** Ensure my proposed trades offer a net gain in value for *me*. Calculate the value of what I'm offering vs. what I'm requesting.\n    *   **Be Reasonable but Firm:** Player 1 rejected my previous offers of 7 Wheat for 1 Ore (value 35 vs 35, seemingly equal but perhaps not appealing to P1). They then offered 5 Sheep (value 65) for 1 Ore (value 35). This is a bad deal for me, offering twice the value.\n    *   **Counter-Offers/Negotiation:** Player 1's latest offer gives me an idea of their priorities or what they consider a \"fair\" exchange for Ore. They want Sheep for Ore. My previous offer of 7 Wheat for 1 Ore was rejected. Perhaps they don't value Wheat as much, or they also have a lot of it.\n6.  **Analyze Player 1's Offer:** Player 1 offered: 5 Sheep (value 65) -> 1 Ore (value 35). This is a terrible offer for me. I would lose 30 value. I must reject this.\n7.  **Consider Player 1's Needs:** Player 1 seems to want Sheep and is willing to give Ore. This is an opportunity, but the ratio they proposed is unacceptable for me. I have 19 Sheep, so I can afford to trade some.\n8.  **Formulate a Better Offer for Ore using Sheep:** Given P1 wants Sheep for Ore, I can try to find a more equitable exchange.\n    *   1 Ore (35) is worth about 2.7 Sheep (13 * 2.7 = 35.1).\n    *   Maybe 2 Sheep for 1 Ore? (2 * 13 = 26 value for me to offer, for 35 value received). This is a gain of 9 value. This might be too good for me and too bad for P1.\n    *   Maybe 3 Sheep for 1 Ore? (3 * 13 = 39 value for me to offer, for 35 value received). This is a loss of 4 value for me, but maybe palatable for P1 if they desperately need Sheep. *This goes against my primary goal of increasing value directly, but could break stalemate.*\n    *   What about Sheep AND Wheat for Ore? If P1 values Sheep more than Wheat, I could leverage this.\n\nDecision Strategy:\n*   Reject Player 1's current offer (5 Sheep for 1 Ore) as it leads to a significant value loss.\n*   Make a counter-offer that acquires Ore, using my surplus Sheep, but at a better rate for me than P1's proposal. I need to make a more attractive offer than 7 Wheat, but not as bad as 5 Sheep.\n*   A 3 Sheep for 1 Ore trade is too much loss. A 2 Sheep for 1 Ore trade is risky for player 1. How about a mix? Or try a smaller number of sheep.\n*   What if I offer 3 Sheep and some Wheat for 1 Ore? Or 2 Sheep and some Wheat for 1 Ore?\n*   Let's try a less aggressive offer to see if I can get Ore for a moderate amount of Sheep. I want to aim for something net positive for me, or at least break even if it gets me a resource I critically need (Ore).\n*   If P1 offered 5 Sheep for 1 Ore (35 value for 65 offered), it suggests they really want Sheep or think they can get a good deal.\n*   I'll try offering a slightly better deal for me than P1's offer, still using Sheep for Ore. Instead of 5 Sheep, what about 4 Sheep for 1 Ore? This is (4 * 13 = 52) offered for (1 * 35 = 35) received. Still a loss of 17 value for me. Bad.\n*   My goal is *total value increase*. I cannot accept losses unless they lead to a bigger gain later (e.g. enabling a very profitable trade down the line, which is not clear here).\n\nLet's rethink: P1 wants 5 Sheep for 1 Ore. I have plenty of Sheep. What if I offer something slightly less than 5 Sheep, but still relatively high from my surplus? For example, 4 Sheep. This is still a loss for me.\nThe best strategy is to counter with a positive value trade *for me*.\nP1 is willing to give Ore. This is good. I want Ore.\nOffer: X Sheep -> 1 Ore. I need X * 13 < 35. So X would be 1 or 2.\n1 Sheep (13) for 1 Ore (35) is too good for me (gain 22). P1 would likely reject this.\n2 Sheep (26) for 1 Ore (35) is also good for me (gain 9). P1 might reject this too.\n\nLet's consider the previous trade rejections.\n7 Wheat (35) -> 1 Ore (35). Denied by P1. This was a direct value match. Perhaps P1 has lots of Wheat or doesn't value it highly.\nP1's current offer suggests they value Sheep highly *relative to Ore*.\n\nI refuse the current offer. I will try a different strategy. I still want Ore or Brick. Since P1 indicated wanting Sheep, I will offer a small amount of sheep + wheat to make it attractive but still profitable for me.\n\nMy goal is to increase my value.\nI have a lot of Wheat (21). It's my lowest value resource.\nI have a lot of Sheep (19). Moderate value.\nI need Ore (highest value, lowest quantity for me).\n\nIf Player 1 wants Sheep, I will offer a small amount of Sheep, perhaps combined with some Wheat, for Ore.\nOffer: 2 Sheep (26) + 2 Wheat (10) = 36 value offered for 1 Ore (35). This is a loss of 1 value. Not good.\n\nWhat about 1 Sheep and 2 Wheat for 1 Ore? (13 + 10 = 23 offered for 35 obtained). This is a gain of 12. P1 rejected 7 Wheat for 1 Ore (35 for 35). This offer is 23 for 35, so P1 would lose significantly on value from their perspective unless they *really* value Sheep and Wheat. This is unlikely to be accepted.\n\nMy strategy needs to be: Reject bad offers. Make a NEW offer that increases my value.\nGiven P1's offer (5 Sheep for 1 Ore), they value 1 Ore less than 5 Sheep.\nMaybe they have a surplus of Ore and P1 wants Sheep.\nI need to make an offer that feels \"fair\" to P1 but benefits me.\n\nLet's assume P1 is trying to trade 5 Sheep for 1 Ore because they have surplus Ore they want to get rid of, or they have a desperate need for Sheep.\nIf Player 1 offers 5 Sheep for 1 Ore, they deem 1 Ore \"worth\" 5 Sheep (65 value).\nIf I make an offer: X Sheep for 1 Ore, P1 will accept if X < 5.\nIf I make it 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, P1 might view this as: \"I give 1 Ore (35), I get 2 Sheep (26). I lose 9 value.\" (From P1's perspective).\nIf I make it 3 Sheep for 1 Ore, P1 might view this as: \"I give 1 Ore (35), I get 3 Sheep (39). I gain 4 value!\" This is a good deal for P1. But bad for me.\n\nThe best move is to use my massive Wheat surplus to get Ore or Brick.\nMy previous 7 Wheat for 1 Ore was rejected. Player 1 clearly doesn't want Wheat for Ore at a 1:1 value ratio.\n\nI have 21 Wheat. I can dump a lot of it.\nI have 19 Sheep. I can dump a lot of it.\n\nPlayer 1 offered \"5 Sheep -> 1 Ore\". This implies they prioritize Sheep and are willing to give up Ore.\nThis is an opportunity for me to get Ore while trading Sheep.\nI need to make the offer slightly better for P1 than my previous offers, but still beneficial for me.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of my low-value resources?\nI have 21 Wheat and 19 Sheep.\nAttempt to target Ore or Brick.\n\nLet's try to get 1 Brick, since Ore is proving difficult.\n1 Brick = 22 value.\nCan I offer Wheat for Brick? What about 5 Wheat (25) for 1 Brick (22)? This is a loss of 3 for me.\nWhat about 4 Wheat (20) for 1 Brick (22)? This is a gain of 2 for me. P1 might reject as they would lose 2.\n\nThe key is to use the resources I have in surplus (Wheat, Sheep) to gain resources I have less of (Ore, Brick), ensuring a net value increase for myself.\nP1's offer (5 Sheep -> 1 Ore) indicated a desire for Sheep. I need to leverage this without taking a huge loss.\n\nIf I accept P1's offer, 5 Sheep (65) -> 1 Ore (35). My value goes down by 30. No.\nI must reject.\n\nThen, I need to make *my own* offer.\nI will try to get Ore again. P1 wants Sheep.\nMy current strategy will be to trade Wheat and Sheep for Ore and Brick.\n\nConsider 1 Ore (value 35).\nIf I offer Wheat: Max 7 Wheat for 1 Ore was rejected.\nIf I offer Sheep: P1 wants 5 Sheep for 1 Ore. I should offer less Sheep.\n\nWhat if I trade Wheat for Brick? I have a lot of Wheat.\nHow about a direct resource-for-resource trade that gets me some value?\nMy most numerous low-value resource is Wheat.\nMy most scarce high-value resource is Ore.\n\nNew offer for Ore, acknowledging P1's past rejections.\nP1 rejected 7 Wheat for 1 Ore.\nP1 offered 5 Sheep for 1 Ore.\n\nThis tells me P1 values Sheep highly. Maybe I can offer something between 7 Wheat and 5 Sheep?\nWhat about 3 Sheep (39) for 1 Ore (35)? This benefits P1, but costs me 4 value. I want to avoid losing value.\n\nI must make an offer that results in a value increase for me.\nLet's offer a combination to acquire 1 Ore.\n1 Sheep (13) + 5 Wheat (25) = 38 value offered. For 1 Ore (35). This is 3 value loss for me.\nWhat about 1 Sheep (13) + 4 Wheat (20) = 33 value offered. For 1 Ore (35). This is a gain of 2 value for me. This is what I want. P1 might reject because it gives them 33 value for 35 value. But P1 previously rejected 35 for 35 (7 Wheat for 1 Ore).\n\nLet's try to get Brick.\n1 Brick (22).\n3 Wheat (15) for 1 Brick (22). Gain 7 for me. Probably too good for me.\n4 Wheat (20) for 1 Brick (22). Gain 2 for me. This is a good offer for me. P1 loses 2 value on this trade.\nP1 rejected a value-neutral trade (7 Wheat for 1 Ore). They probably want to win on value, just like me.\n\nI need to make an offer where P1 gains value, or at least breaks even, while still netting me value. This is the challenge.\nOne strategy is to offer resources they might need to complete a set or achieve a goal, even at a slight value loss, if it sets me up for a bigger gain later. But right now, it's about direct value increase.\n\nConsider P1 wants Sheep badly. Let's offer Sheep, but for a higher value resource than Ore.\nPerhaps 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore? Value 65 -> 70. This is a gain of 5. Might be too much to ask P1 for.\n\nLet's go back to basics. I have tons of Wheat. I want Ore/Brick.\nThe previous rejections indicate P1 is not easy to trade with.\nI need to make an offer that is slightly appealing to P1, but still positive for me.\nHow about offering a significant amount of Wheat for a smaller amount of a higher value resource?\n\nI have 21 Wheat.\nWhat if I offer 10 Wheat (50 value) for 2 Brick (44 value)? Lose 6 value. No.\nWhat if I offer 8 Wheat (40 value) for 1 Ore (35 value)? Lose 5 value. No.\n\nThis is tricky. It's hard to make a profitable trade for me if the other player rejects balanced trades.\nI should try to get the highest value resource I can with my lowest value resources, specifically where I have a surplus.\n\nMy highest surplus is Wheat. Let's try to trade Wheat for Ore.\nMy previous offer: 7 Wheat (35) -> 1 Ore (35) was rejected.\nWhat if I offer *more* Wheat than previous to sweeten the deal, hoping P1 takes it for the quantity?\n8 Wheat (40) -> 1 Ore (35). I would lose 5 value. I don't want to lose value.\n\nThe game is about increasing value. I only have 1 Ore.\nI will propose: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nCalculation for my proposed offer:\nOffered: 2 Sheep (2 * 13 = 26) + 4 Wheat (4 * 5 = 20) = 46 value.\nRequested: 1 Ore (1 * 35 = 35) = 35 value.\nThis means I would offer 46 value to gain 35 value. I lose 11 value. This is a bad trade for me.\n\nThe target is to *increase* total value.\nI must reject Player 1's offer. Then I must make a trade that *increases my value*.\nThis means the value of what I offer must be LESS than the value of what I receive.\n\nAttempt 1: Get Ore. My Ore quantity is low.\nTarget: 1 Ore (35 value).\nWhat can I give to make this a gain?\nGive: 2 Sheep (26 value). Gain: 9 value. (26 < 35). This is the best option for me, but P1 is unlikely to accept if they value Sheep highly. P1 wants 5 Sheep for 1 Ore. This is vastly different.\n\nGiven P1's strong desire for Sheep (5 Sheep for 1 Ore), they might accept a lower Sheep amount for Ore than initially offered because they are getting a resource they specifically want.\nLet's try to leverage Player 1's high perceived value of Sheep.\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep (26) -> 1 Ore (35). Gain 9 for me. P1 loses 9. This is unlikely to be accepted if P1 is rational.\nWhat if P1 sees Sheep as extremely valuable to them, perhaps more than the raw value?\nIf P1 refused 7 Wheat (35) for 1 Ore (35), and then offered 5 Sheep (65) for 1 Ore (35), it means they don't value Wheat much from me, and they really value Sheep.\nSo, if I offer a low amount of Sheep for Ore, it's highly unlikely they would accept because they value Sheep so much.\n\nI need to offer something P1 will take, that nets me value.\nThe only way I can get value if P1 is valuing Sheep so highly is if I can offload other resources they might need (like Wheat or Wood) for Ore or Brick.\n\nMy last offer of 7 Wheat for 1 Ore was rejected.\nI have a ton of Wheat. I need to get rid of it.\nI won't trade Wheat for Ore at a loss.\nWhat about trading Wheat for Wood or Sheep if P1 has a lot and wants Wheat? But I have plenty of Sheep and Wood.\n\nI *must* pursue a high-value resource.\nLet's try Brick.\n1 Brick = 22 value.\nCan I offer Wheat for Brick?\nOffer: 4 Wheat (20) -> 1 Brick (22). My gain: 2. P1's gain: -2. P1 rejected trades where they lost even 0 value.\n\nThis is tough. P1 has either a very strong bias or different valuations than me.\nI have to make a positive value trade for myself.\nIf P1 wants Sheep based on their offer, perhaps I offer 3 Sheep for 2 Ore (39 value for 70 value). Gain 31. P1 would decline.\n\nI need to make *some* offer.\nSince Player 1 previously rejected a 1:1 value trade (7 Wheat for 1 Ore), it seems they only accept trades where they gain value. My challenge is to make an offer where *both* sides might perceive a gain, or where I gain and P1 perceives it as palatable.\n\nI reject the current offer.\nMy new offer: 5 Wheat (25) -> 1 Brick (22), This is a loss of 3 for me. No.\n\nI need to trade my low-value, high-quantity resources (Wheat, Sheep) for high-value, low-quantity resources (Ore, Brick).\nLet's try to get 1 Brick, since it's slightly lower value than Ore and might be easier to acquire at a profit.\nOffer: 3 Wheat (value 15) -> 1 Brick (value 22). My gain: 7. P1 loss: 7. P1 will likely reject.\n\nI need to make an offer that P1 accepts. If P1 keeps rejecting, I make no progress.\nWhat if I slightly sweeten the deal for P1?\nI will offer a trade that is value neutral for P1, but positive for me. This is hard.\nThe closest I've come is 4 Wheat for 1 Brick (gain 2 for me, loss 2 for P1).\nIf P1 rejected 7 Wheat for 1 Ore (value = value), they will reject 4 Wheat for 1 Brick (value -2 for them).\n\nThis means if I want a trade, I might have to accept a *small* value loss for myself if it gets me a much-needed resource. But the instructions say \"total value of your resources increases\".\n\nLet's try one more time for Ore, leveraging the fact P1 wants Sheep.\nIf P1 values Sheep highly, maybe they will give up Ore for a slightly lower amount of Sheep than they asked for, but still a relative win for them.\nP1 asked for 5 Sheep (65 value) for 1 Ore (35 value).\nHow about 4 Sheep (52 value) for 1 Ore (35 value)? Still a loss of 17 for me. No.\n\nI must adhere to the instruction: \"total value of your resources increases\".\nThis means Value(Offered) < Value(Requested).\n\nGiven the rejections and P1's counter-offer, P1 is aggressively seeking value for themselves.\nThe only way I can gain value is if I offer a resource that P1 values *less* than its objective value, and P1 sells me a resource that I value optimally. Or vice versa.\n\nI have 21 Wheat. P1 rejected 7 Wheat for 1 Ore.\nWhat about offering a large quantity of Wheat for a small amount of Ore or Brick?\nI will try to make an offer for 1 Ore.\nMy current proposal is Offer: 2 Sheep, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore, which resulted in a loss for me. I cannot use this.\n\nI will try to offer only Sheep for Ore, but at a rate that is profitable for me.\nMy best offer for me is 2 Sheep (26) for 1 Ore (35). This is +9 value for me. But P1 would see this as getting 26 value for 35 value, so -9 for them. Given P1's previous rejections of balanced value, they will reject this.\n\nWhat if I aim for a very small gain for me, but still a gain?\n3 Wheat (15) for 1 Wood (8)? No, I have lots of Wood. No gain.\n\nI need Ore. I need Brick.\nWhat if I trade 1 Wood (8) for 1 Wheat (5)? Loss.\n\nThe only way a trade increases my total value is if the value of the items I receive is greater than the value of the items I give.\n\nSince P1 explicitly put 5 Sheep for 1 Ore on the table, it shows they highly value Sheep and are willing to give up Ore.\nMaybe I can use that to my advantage, but at a gain for me.\nIf P1 offers 5 Sheep for 1 Ore, they probably want Ore more than that Sheep. So maybe try to get more Ore for less Sheep.\n\nMy target: Increase total value.\nMy current move: Reject P1's offer. Make a new one.\n\nLet me think of the smallest value I can gain from a trade that P1 might consider.\nOffer (X Sheep) -> 1 Ore (35). X needs to be 1 or 2 to gain value.\nOffer (X Wheat) -> 1 Brick (22). X needs to be 1, 2, 3, or 4 to gain value. (4W = 20, 1B=22, gain 2). This is the smallest \"gain for me, loss for P1\".\n\nI will propose to trade Wheat for Brick, striving for a small gain for me.\nI will propose: 4 Wheat (20) -> 1 Brick (22).\nMy gain: 22 - 20 = 2.\nP1's loss: 22 - 20 = 2.\nP1 rejected an offer where they lost 0 (7 Wheat -> 1 Ore). So this is not very likely to succeed.\n\nWhat if I offer a trade where P1 *also* gains? This typically happens if our valuations are different, e.g. I have a lot of Wheat and need Brick, P1 has a lot of Brick and needs Wheat.\n\nGiven the limited information, and that P1 keeps rejecting balanced/slightly negative offers for them, I have to try making an offer appealing to them while being net positive for me.\n\nThe best strategy for me to achieve a positive value trade seems to be to acquire Ore (value 35) or Brick (value 22) and to use my lowest value resource (Wheat, value 5) or excess Sheep (value 13).\n\nFinal attempt at a mutually beneficial (or at least, P1 neutrally inclined) trade:\nMaybe P1 needs multiple resources to complete a building or something.\nBut since I don't know P1's hidden objective, I only go by value.\n\nI will try to get 1 Brick, using Wheat.\nOffer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick (15 for 22, net +7 for me) - very unlikely due to high gain for me.\nOffer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick (20 for 22, net +2 for me) - possible, but P1 is already rejecting these.\nWhat if I offer 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick (25 for 22, net -3 for me) - NOT allowed.\n\nI must stick to the constraint: increase total value.\nReject the current bad offer.\nThen offer a relatively small gain for me, with a loss for P1, but using resources P1 might prefer.\n\nGiven Player 1's rejected trade of 7 Wheat for 1 Ore, and their proposal of 5 Sheep for 1 Ore:\n*   P1 does not value Wheat much, or has a surplus.\n*   P1 values Sheep highly, and needs it.\n*   P1 seems willing to trade away Ore.\n\nI must leverage P1's desire for Sheep to get Ore, *while still gaining value*.\nTo gain value for myself, if I give X Sheep for 1 Ore: X * 13 < 35. So X has to be 1 or 2 Sheep.\nOffer: 2 Sheep (26 value) -> 1 Ore (35 value). Gain 9 value.\nP1 would suffer a 9 value loss. But they offered 5 Sheep for 1 Ore (value for them: 35-65 = -30). So they are willing to take a huge value loss too.\nSo this offer (2 Sheep for 1 Ore) is much better for P1 than their offer was for me (they lose 9, I would lose 30).\nThis is the most plausible trade that increases my value.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"Offer\",\n  \"offered_items\": {\n    \"Sheep\": 2\n  },\n  \"requested_items\": {\n    \"Ore\": 1\n  }\n}\n```",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Understand Current Value:** Calculate the total current value of all resources to establish a baseline. This helps in understanding how much value needs to be gained from trades.\n2.  **Resource Valuation (Your Side):** Know the individual value of each resource. This is crucial for determining fair trades and identifying which resources are more or less valuable to you.\n3.  **Identify Surplus Resources:** Determine which resources you have in abundance (high quantity). These are good candidates for offering in trades.\n4.  **Identify Deficit/High-Value Resources:** Determine which resources you have in low quantity, especially those with high individual value. These are good candidates for requesting. Ore and Brick are currently the highest value items.\n5.  **Target High-Value Trades:** Prioritize trades that bring in resources with a higher per-unit value and/or allow you to offload lower-value resources. This maximizes the increase in total value. For example, trade Wheat (5) or Wood (8) or Sheep (13) for Brick (22) or Ore (35).\n6.  **Negotiation Leverage:** Understand that your offers and rejections communicate value and preference. Being firm on demanding highly valued items while being flexible on offering plentiful, lower-valued items can be effective.\n7.  **Adaptive Strategy:** The other player's rejections (especially Player 1 rejecting multiple offers involving Ore) suggest they may value Ore highly or have a surplus of the items you are offering. Analyze their rejections to infer their needs and adjust offers accordingly.\n8.  **Offer Sweeteners/Bundling:** If initial offers are rejected, consider bundling more of your lower-value resources for a desired high-value resource.\n9.  **Incremental Offers:** Start with a good but not overly generous offer, and if rejected, adjust incrementally rather than making drastic changes to gauge the other player's acceptable range.\n10. **Game Turn Awareness:** With multiple turns remaining, there's room to experiment, but each turn lost without a successful trade is a missed opportunity.\n11. **Analyze Past Offers:**\n    *   Player 0: 5 Wheat (25), 3 Sheep (39) -> 1 Brick (22), 1 Ore (35) [Value offer: 64 -> 57]. This was a net loss in value for Player 0, which is bad. The goal is to increase *your* total value.\n    *   Player 0: 7 Wheat (35) -> 1 Ore (35). This was a neutral value trade.\n    *   Player 1: 5 Sheep (65) -> 1 Ore (35). This offer was bad for Player 0, giving up 65 value for 35.\n    *   Player 0: 2 Sheep (26), 4 Wheat (20) -> 1 Ore (35) [Value offer: 46 -> 35]. This was also a net loss of value for Player 0. All of Player 0's past offers would have decreased or maintained their value, which goes against the game's objective.\n\nMy current resources and values:\n*   Wheat: 21 * 5 = 105\n*   Wood: 12 * 8 = 96\n*   Sheep: 19 * 13 = 247\n*   Brick: 18 * 22 = 396\n*   Ore: 11 * 35 = 385\nTotal Value: 105 + 96 + 247 + 396 + 385 = 1229\n\nLooking at my past offers, I have consistently made offers that would either decrease or maintain my total value. This is a critical error. The goal is to *increase* my total value. I need to request high-value resources (Brick, Ore) and offer multiple units of low-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) such that the *value of what I receive is greater than the value of what I give*.\n\nMy most abundant resources are Wheat (21) and Sheep (19). Ore (11) and Wood (12) are lower quantity. Brick (18) is high value and relatively high quantity.\n\nI want more Ore and Brick. I have plenty of Wheat and Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\n1 Ore = 35 value.\nI need to offer less than 35 value in return. This means I need to offer multiple lower-value items that *collectively* add up to slightly less than 35, or I need to offer a high quantity of low-value items that the other player might want.\nPrevious offers of 7 Wheat (35) for 1 Ore (35) were neutral. Offering more for less makes sense.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep and Wheat. Let's try leveraging the quantity of Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nThis is 8 * 5 = 40 value given for 35 value received. Still a net loss for me. This is incorrect. I must receive more value than I give.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. I should offer items with lower value for items with higher value.\nI have a surplus of Sheep (19).\n1 Sheep = 13.\n1 Ore = 35.\nI need to offer less than 35 value to get 35 value.\nIf I offered 2 Sheep (26) for 1 Ore (35). This is 26 value given for 35 value received. (Increase of 9 value). This is a good trade for me, if accepted.\nPlayer 1 rejected \"5 Sheep -> 1 Ore\". This means Player 1 doesn't want 5 Sheep for 1 Ore (which was 65 value given for 35 value received for me, bad for me).\nThe previous offer 2 Sheep, 4 Wheat (46) -> 1 Ore (35) was a bad offer for me previously.\n\nLet's stick to the principle: Value received > Value offered.\nI have 19 Sheep. I can part with some.\nI want Ore (35) or Brick (22).\n\nCurrent resources:\nWheat: 21 (5)\nWood: 12 (8)\nSheep: 19 (13)\nBrick: 18 (22)\nOre: 11 (35)\n\nTrying to get 1 Ore (35).\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (26), this is a 9 value gain for me. This is reasonable. Player 1 rejected 5 Sheep for 1 Ore, so they might not want Sheep, or they think 5 Sheep is too much to give for 1 Ore *for them*. My new offer of 2 Sheep is much less.\n\nLet's try to get a high-value item by offering a combination of lower-value items that is overall still favorable to me.\nMaybe 1 Wood (8) + 1 Sheep (13) + 1 Wheat (5) = 26. This isn't much better than just 2 Sheep.\n\nI need to make sure the value I *receive* is higher than the value I *give*.\n\nLet's target Ore. It's the highest value resource.\nI want 1 Ore (Value 35).\nI will offer 2 Sheep (Value 26).\nNet gain for me: 35 - 26 = 9.\nThis maximizes the value gain for me per trade, while still being a reasonable offer.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means seeking trades where the value of resources offered is less than the value of resources received.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** Understand the individual value of each resource. Ore (35) and Brick (22) are currently my highest value resources. Wheat (5) is my lowest.\n3.  **Strategic Resource Acquisition:** High-value resources (Ore, Brick) are generally more desirable to acquire, especially if they can be obtained for relatively low-value resources.\n4.  **Identifying Bargaining Power:** My large quantities of Wheat (21) and Sheep (19) give me more flexibility to offer them in trades without significantly depleting my stock. My relatively low quantity of Ore (11) makes it a resource I'm less willing to part with unless the return is exceptionally good.\n5.  **Understanding Past Interactions:** Player 1 has consistently rejected my offers involving Wheat for Ore, even offers of 8 Wheat for 1 Ore (Value: 40 vs 35). This suggests Player 1 either highly values their Ore, doesn't value my Wheat as much, or sees my offers as unfavorable. Player 1 also offered 5 Sheep for 1 Ore (Value: 65 vs 35), indicating they might be willing to pay a premium for Ore but expect me to as well.\n6.  **Adapting Offers:** Since previous offers of Wheat for Ore have failed, I need to try different combinations or resources. Perhaps Player 1 is more interested in Wood or Sheep. Or, I need to sweeten the deal for Ore by offering a more valuable combination of resources.\n7.  **Consider Player 1's Perspective (Inferred):** Player 1 rejected 8 Wheat for 1 Ore. They offered 5 Sheep for 1 Ore. This implies they value Sheep highly *if they are receiving something valuable in return*, or they have a surplus of Sheep or a high need for Ore.\n8.  **Risk Management:** Avoid trades that significantly decrease my quantities of valuable resources (Ore, Brick) unless the gain is substantial.\n9.  **Incremental Adjustments:** If an offer is close but rejected, adjust slightly (e.g., reduce what I offer, or increase what I request minimally) rather than making drastic changes. However, after multiple rejections, a more significant shift in strategy is warranted.\n10. **Maintaining Negotiation Flow:** Despite repeated rejections, I should continue making offers to keep the negotiation open.\n\nTrading Decision:\nMy previous attempts to get Ore using Wheat have failed consistently. Player 1 seems to value Ore highly and doesn't want Wheat for it at the rates I've offered. Player 1 *did* offer 5 Sheep for 1 Ore, which is a significant overpay on their part (65 value for 35 value). This confirms their high desire for Ore. Given I have a good quantity of Sheep (19) and they have a high value (13), I might try to leverage my Sheep to get something else valuable.\n\nI need to either offer resources Player 1 values more for their desirable Ore, or target a different high-value resource from them like Brick. If Player 1 is offering 5 Sheep (value 65) for 1 Ore (value 35), it means they see a specific utility in Ore beyond its base value, or they have a surplus of Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get Brick or Ore. Since my Wheat/Ore offers have failed, let's try a different combination, perhaps involving some Wood or more Sheep. I don't want to overpay like Player 1 seems willing to.\n\nMy goal is to increase value.\nCurrent total value: (21*5) + (12*8) + (19*13) + (18*22) + (11*35) = 105 + 96 + 247 + 396 + 385 = 1229\n\nLet's rethink the Ore acquisition. Player 1 rejected 8 Wheat (40) for 1 Ore (35). This suggests they want a premium for their Ore, or my Wheat is not desirable. Their offer of 5 Sheep (65) for 1 Ore (35) is an overpay. I should try to *exploit* their high valuation of Ore if I can, but by acquiring it, not offering it.\n\nGiven my attempts to get Ore have failed, and Player 1 is making high counter-offers for Ore, perhaps I should pivot away from demanding Ore from them for now, and try to offload low-value resources for higher-value ones, or acquire Brick.\n\nI have limited Ore (11) and Brick (18), but plenty of Wheat (21), Wood (12), and Sheep (19).\n\nSince Player 1 seems to value Ore so highly, I will not offer them Ore.\nLet's try to get Brick, which is also a high-value resource. I have a lot of Sheep. Perhaps they need Sheep for something.\n\nLet's try a balanced offer to get Brick, using Sheep and Wheat.\n2 Sheep (26), 4 Wheat (20) -> 1 Brick (22). Total offered: 46. Requested: 22. This is a bad trade for me.\n\nMy focus should be getting value.\nI have a lot of Wheat. Let's try to get a higher value resource using a lot of Wheat.\nGetting 1 Brick (22) for 3 Wheat (15) and 1 Wood (8) = 23. This is approximately even value. Player 1 might accept a roughly even trade if they need the resources.\n\nLet's try to offer a mix of lower-value resources for a high-value one, keeping the value offered slightly higher than value received to incentivize the other player, but not by too much.\n\nProposal: I offer 10 Wheat (50 value) for 2 Brick (44 value). This gives them a slight premium. It would deplete my Wheat but give me high-value Brick.\n\nLet's try an offer that leverages my surplus Wheat for Brick.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "**Generate Knowledge:**\n\n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: In this game, resources have fixed values: \n   - Wheat: 5  \n   - Wood: 8  \n   - Sheep: 12  \n   - Brick: 26  \n   - Ore: 40  \n   Therefore, maximizing total value means acquiring high-value resources (especially Ore and Brick) and minimizing loss of high-value resources.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost and Trade Efficiency**: A good trade increases the total value of your holdings. Evaluate offers based on net value gain:  \n   - Gain per unit of high-value resources (Ore at 40, Brick at 26) is ideal.\n   - Low-value resources (Wheat at 5, Sheep at 12) can be leveraged to obtain these, especially if surplus.\n\n3. **Abundance and Scarcity Strategy**:  \n   - You have **25 Brick** (high value, possible surplus).  \n   - You have **23 Ore** (very high value, possibly keep unless a strong gain).  \n   - You have **25 Sheep** (high quantity, value 12 \u2014 moderate).  \n   - You have **15 Wheat** (low value, possibly expendable).  \n   - You have **7 Wood** (low quantity, not involved yet).  \n\n   \u2192 Brick and Sheep may be used for trading, especially if fetching higher-value Ore.\n\n4. **Trading Leverage**:  \n   - Players may be seeking Ore (valued at 40) \u2014 but you already have 23. Unless you need specific resources, **Ore should be traded sparingly**.\n   - Brick (26) is second-highest; you have a surplus. Can use Brick as bait, but **only if receiving Ore or equivalent value**.\n\n5. **Counterparty Behavior Analysis**:  \n   - Player 0 repeatedly offers Wheat (low value) for Ore or Brick \u2014 suggests they undervalue Wheat or desperately need higher-tier resources.\n   - Their latest offer: **10 Wheat \u2192 2 Brick**  \n     - 10 Wheat = 50 value outgoing (from them)  \n     - 2 Brick = 52 value incoming (to them)  \n     - Very close to fair (slightly favorable to them)\n     - But for **you**, receiving 10 Wheat (value 50) vs losing 2 Brick (value 52) \u2192 **net loss of 2 value** \u2192 not worth accepting.\n\n6. **Aggressive Initiative**: Since Player 0 is persistently offering, and you have not successfully traded, **you should craft a strategic offer** that:\n   - Leverages your surplus (e.g., Wheat, Sheep)\n   - Acquires high-value resources (Ore preferred)\n   - Ensures positive net value\n\n7. **Offer Design Principle**:  \n   Aim for trades where:\n   - You **receive higher total value** than you give.\n   - You **target Ore** since it has the highest unit value.\n\n   Example: Giving 2 Sheep (2\u00d712=24) and 3 Wheat (3\u00d75=15) = total value 39 \u2192 can reasonably request 1 Ore (40) \u2192 slight gain.\n\n   Or: 5 Sheep (60 value) \u2192 1 Ore (40) is **overpaying** \u2014 reject such offers.\n\n**Apply Knowledge to Current Situation:**\n\n- Player 0 just offered: **10 Wheat \u2192 2 Brick**  \n  - You have 15 Wheat \u2192 giving 10 is feasible  \n  - But 2 Brick = 52 \u2192 you have 25 Brick, so losing 2 is fine, **but only if gain justifies**  \n  - 10 Wheat = 50 value \u2192 you lose 2 value net \u2192 **Deny**\n\nHowever, no incoming offer currently open \u2014 you must **make your own offer** to advance.\n\nLet's craft a **favorable offer** leveraging surplus Sheep and low-value Wheat to get Ore.\n\nBest idea:\n- Offer: 3 Sheep (36) + 2 Wheat (10) = 46 value  \n- Request: 1 Ore (40) \u2192 you gain net 6 value (wait \u2014 no: 46 given, 40 received \u2192 net -6)\n\nWait: that\u2019s a **loss**. Must reverse thinking.\n\nTo gain 1 Ore (40), you should offer <40 value.\n\nBetter: Offer 2 Sheep (24) + 3 Wheat (15) = 39 \u2192 request 1 Ore (40) \u2192 net **+1 value** \u2014 favorable.\n\nEven better: Offer 2 Sheep + 2 Wheat = 24 + 10 = 34 \u2192 request 1 Ore \u2192 net gain of 6.\n\nBut will they accept?\n\nAlternatively, use Sheep surplus to acquire Brick? No \u2014 you already have 25 Brick \u2014 likely not needed.\n\nGoal: **Maximize total value** \u2014 so focus on converting low-value resources into high-value ones.\n\nYou have **25 Sheep** \u2014 high quantity, value 12 \u2014 moderate. Can use them.\n\nBut **Ore is king** (40). Target Ore.\n\nLet\u2019s make an offer that gives moderate value, requests 1 Ore.\n\n**Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore**  \n- You give: 3\u00d712 + 2\u00d75 = 36 + 10 = 46 \u2192 want 40 \u2192 net -6 \u2192 bad\n\nWe need to **receive** more than we give.\n\nFlip: Can we get **1 Ore** for less than 40?\n\nTry: Offer **2 Sheep, 1 Wheat** \u2192 24 + 5 = 29 \u2192 request 1 Ore (40) \u2192 net gain 11 \u2014 very good.\n\nBut is this believable? Will Player 0 accept?\n\nPlayer 0 previously offered 8 Wheat for 1 Ore \u2192 that\u2019s 40 vs 40 \u2192 even.\n\nSo 8 Wheat = 1 Ore is at parity.\n\nTherefore, 1 Sheep (12) is slightly better than 2.4 Wheat (12).\n\nSo 1 Sheep \u2248 2.4 Wheat\n\nSo 2 Sheep \u2248 4.8 Wheat\n\nSo 2 Sheep + 1 Wheat \u2248 5.8 Wheat \u2192 much less than 8\n\nSo offering 2 Sheep + 1 Wheat for 1 Ore is **way below market**, based on their prior behavior.\n\nBut maybe they'll accept if greedy.\n\nBut better: meet near their implied rate.\n\nTheir rate: **8 Wheat = 1 Ore**\n\nSo fair trade: 8 Wheat for 1 Ore (40 \u2194 40)\n\nYou can improve slightly by adding small item.\n\nBut you want **net gain**.\n\nAlternative: offer **6 Wheat and 1 Sheep (6\u00d75=30 + 12=42)** \u2192 request 1 Ore (40) \u2192 you lose 2 \u2192 **bad**\n\nNo.\n\nWait \u2014 you want to receive Ore, so **must offer less value than 40**.\n\nBest chance: Offer **7 Wheat (35)** \u2192 request **1 Ore (40)** \u2192 net gain 5.\n\nBased on their last offer (8 Wheat for 1 Ore), 7 Wheat is slightly below \u2014 possible.\n\nOr **6 Wheat + 1 Sheep** = 30+12=42 \u2192 too much.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe trade **up** using your surplus Sheep to get Ore, but **only if net gain**.\n\nAlternatively: **Offer 2 Brick \u2192 Request 1 Ore**, with bonus?\n\nBut 1 Ore = 40, 2 Brick = 52 \u2192 no.\n\nReverse: **Offer 1 Ore \u2192 Request 2 Brick?** \u2014 40 vs 52 \u2192 net gain 12.\n\nWait \u2014 **this is promising.**\n\nYou have **23 Ore** \u2014 surplus possible.\n\n2 Brick = 52 value\n1 Ore = 40\n\nSo if you **give 1 Ore (40)** and **get 2 Brick (52)**, you gain **+12 value** \u2014 excellent.\n\nAnd Player 0 previously asked for 2 Brick in exchange for 10 Wheat \u2014 they value Brick.\n\nSo likely they may want Brick.\n\nSo offer: **1 Ore \u2192 2 Brick**\n\nLet\u2019s check:  \n- You give: 1 Ore (40)  \n- You receive: 2 Brick (52)  \n- Net gain: **+12** \u2014 very good.\n\nYou have 23 Ore \u2014 losing 1 is fine.  \nYou have 25 Brick \u2014 gaining 2 brings you to 27 \u2014 fine.\n\nThis is a strong offer.\n\nAlternatively: **request more**, like **1 Ore and 1 Sheep for 2 Brick**, but that might be too much.\n\nBut better to keep it simple.\n\nBest move: **[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]**\n\nBut wait \u2014 previous offer from Player 0 was **10 Wheat -> 2 Brick**, meaning they are okay with giving up value to get Brick.\n\nSo they might accept **Ore for Brick**, especially since Ore is more valuable.\n\nBut Ore is 40, Brick 26 \u2192 2 Brick = 52 > 40 \u2192 so giving 1 Ore for 2 Brick is **good for you**, **bad for them** unless strategic.\n\nBut if they need Brick for building, they might accept.\n\nAlternatively, to make it palatable: **Offer 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick**\n\nCheck: give 12+15=27, get 26 \u2192 lose 1 \u2014 not worth.\n\nNo.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe **no good offer**, but you must act.\n\nBack to **Ore for multiple Bricks** \u2014 **only viable surplus-for-higher-value trade**.\n\nAnother idea: **You have 25 Sheep**, maybe offer **4 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore**\n\n4 Sheep = 48 \u2192 get 40 \u2192 lose 8 \u2014 bad.\n\n3 Sheep = 36 \u2192 get 1 Ore = 40 \u2192 gain 4 \u2014 **good**.\n\nAnd 3 Sheep is manageable.\n\nDo that.\n\n**Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore**\n\n- You give 36 value\n- Get 40 value\n- Net gain: +4\n\nBetter than nothing.\n\nAnd Player 0 has been seeking Ore, but maybe willing to **provide Ore for something**?\n\nWait \u2014 no: they have been **requesting** Ore, not offering.\n\nIn all their offers, they **want** Ore.\n\nSo **they likely don\u2019t have extra Ore**.\n\nThus, offering 3 Sheep for 1 Ore \u2014 they probably don\u2019t have Ore to give.\n\nSo **low chance of acceptance**.\n\nTherefore, **better to go the other way**: trade your Ore for their resources \u2014 if favorable.\n\nLike: **1 Ore -> 2 Brick + 1 Wheat** \u2014 massive gain.\n\nBut too greedy.\n\nBest realistic trade: **1 Ore -> 2 Brick**\n\nNet gain: +12\n\nThey used 10 Wheat for 2 Brick \u2014 10 Wheat = 50, 2 Brick = 52 \u2014 they were willing to do that.\n\nSo 1 Ore = 40 < 50 \u2014 so **even better deal for them? No** \u2014 they receive 40 value vs 50 previously \u2014 **worse**.\n\nWait: in their offer, they **gave** 10 Wheat (50) to **get** 2 Brick (52)\n\nNow, if you **give** 1 Ore (40) to **get** 2 Brick (52), they **receive** 40 (less than 50), so **they lose more than before** \u2014 no incentive.\n\nWait \u2014 confusion.\n\nIn their offer:  \n- They **offer 10 Wheat**, **request 2 Brick**  \n\u2192 They give 50, get 52 \u2192 net +2\n\nIf you offer: **1 Ore \u2192 2 Brick**  \n\u2192 You give 40, they give 52 \u2192 **they gain 12**, you gain 12? No:\n\nWait \u2014 in trades:  \n- When you offer: **[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]** means:\n  - You give 1 Ore\n  - They give 2 Brick\n- So **you gain**: 2 Brick (52) - lose 1 Ore (40) \u2192 net +12\n- **They gain**: 1 Ore (40) - lose 2 Brick (52) \u2192 net -12 \u2192 **bad for them**\n\nSo they won\u2019t accept.\n\nSo **bad offer**.\n\nNeed to **request less**, or **add something**?\n\nNo.\n\nAlternative: **get what they want**, which is **Brick and Ore**.\n\nBut they haven\u2019t offered anything good.\n\nPerhaps **wait**, but you must make a move.\n\nAnother idea: **use low-value resources to get something**\n\nYou have 15 Wheat \u2014 low value.\n\nBest trade in past: they offered 8 Wheat for 1 Ore \u2014 40 vs 40 \u2192 fair.\n\nSo if you can get 1 Ore for **<8 Wheat and some Sheep**, slight gain.\n\nBut cannot get them to **give** Ore.\n\nSo maybe **target Brick** \u2014 they want it, so they might trade *up*.\n\nBut **what can you gain**?\n\nYou already have 25 Brick \u2014 do you need more? Probably not.\n\nUnless for future exchange.\n\nBut goal is **increase value**.\n\nYou have 7 Wood \u2014 value 8 \u2014 low quantity.\n\nNot useful for trade.\n\nPerhaps **accept that no good trade now**, but must act.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe **offer a trade that swaps medium for high**:\n\nYou have Sheep and Wheat in surplus.\n\nOffer: **5 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick, 1 Wheat**\n\nCheck:\n\n- You give: 5\u00d712 = 60\n- You get: 2\u00d726 = 52 + 5 = 57 \u2192 wait, 1 Wheat = 5\n- Total receive: 57\n- Give: 60 \u2192 net -3 \u2192 bad.\n\nNo.\n\nOffer: **4 Sheep, 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick, 1 Ore**  \n- Give: 48 + 10 = 58\n- Get: 26 + 40 = 66 \u2192 net +8 \u2014 good\n\nBut do they have 1 Brick and 1 Ore to spare? Unlikely.\n\nAnd they have been requesting those.\n\nDoubtful.\n\nBest insight: **Player 0 is willing to give up large amounts of Wheat for Brick or Ore**, which are higher value.\n\nSo you can **exploit this** by offering **less than fair value for their wanted items**.\n\nBut you need to **receive** high-value items.\n\nSince they **want Ore and Brick**, but **have only Wheat**, the **only thing they can offer is Wheat**.\n\nSo **only possible trade**: Wheat in, Brick or Ore out.\n\nBut you have Brick and Ore \u2014 should you trade them for Wheat?\n\nOnly if you gain value.\n\nExample: **lose 1 Brick (26)** \u2192 gain 6 Wheat (30) \u2192 net +4 \u2014 good.\n\n6 Wheat = 30 > 26.\n\nYou have 25 Brick \u2014 losing 1 is fine.\n\nBut 6 Wheat: you have 15 \u2014 not urgent.\n\nValue wise: yes, net gain.\n\nBut is it optimal?\n\nBetter: **lose 1 Ore (40)** \u2192 gain 9 Wheat (45) \u2192 net +5\n\nEven better.\n\nBut you need to **receive more Wheat than value equivalent**.\n\nTheir last offer: 10 Wheat for 2 Brick \u2192 50 for 52 \u2192 they accept slight loss.\n\nSo they might give 9 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n\nOffer: **1 Ore -> 9 Wheat**\n\nYou give 40, get 45 \u2014 net +5\n\nOr **8 Wheat** is 40 \u2014 even, not good.\n\nMust be **at least 9 Wheat** to gain.\n\nBut will they accept?\n\nThey previously offered 8 Wheat for 1 Ore \u2014 implying they are willing to **pay up to 8**.\n\nOffering 9 might be acceptable.\n\nOr try 8 Wheat and 1 Sheep? But you don't want to give.\n\nNo \u2014 you want to **get** 9 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n\nSo offer: **[Offer: 1 Ore -> 9 Wheat]**\n\nNet gain: 5\n\nYou have 23 Ore \u2014 losing 1 is fine.\n\nYou have 15 Wheat \u2014 gaining 9 brings to 24 \u2014 not crucial, but value increases.\n\nIs there a better trade?\n\n**Conclusion**: The only value-positive trades involve converting your high-value resources into larger value of low ones, but that's only if quantity offers future opportunities.\n\nBut since the game is 10 turns, and you need to increase value, **any positive trade helps**.\n\nAlternatively, **no offer**, but previous pattern shows you made an offer last turn.\n\nLast move: you made no offer.\n\nBefore that: you offered 5 Sheep for 1 Ore \u2014 they rejected.\n\nSo you should try again.\n\nBut better: use **Ore to get Wheat**, net gain.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n**[Offer: 1 Ore -> 9 Wheat]**  \n- You give: 1 Ore (40)\n- You receive: 9 Wheat (45)\n- Net gain: +5\n\nThis is the best feasible offer based on Player 0\u2019s demonstrated willingness to trade Wheat for Ore.\n\nEven though their last such offer was 8 Wheat for 1 Ore, requesting 9 is pushing \u2014 they may reject \u2014 but worth trying.\n\nIf they accept, you gain value.\n\nAny other trade either loses value or is unlikely.\n\nSo make the offer.\n\n**[Offer: 1 Ore -> 9 Wheat]**",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value-Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I should aim to trade away lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or at least break even on value while acquiring resources I might need for future, more valuable trades.\n2.  **Resource Scarcity/Abundance and Value:**\n    *   **High Value/Scarce:** Ore (35), Brick (22). These are my most valuable resources. I should be cautious about trading them away unless the return is substantial. I have 11 Ore and 18 Brick.\n    *   **Medium Value:** Sheep (13). I have 19 Sheep.\n    *   **Low Value/Abundant:** Wood (8), Wheat (5). My Wheat (21) and Wood (12) are relatively abundant and have the lowest per-unit value. These are prime candidates for trading away to acquire higher-value resources.\n3.  **Negotiation History & Player 1's Preferences:**\n    *   Player 1 has consistently rejected offers where I offered Wheat for Ore or Brick (7 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 10 Wheat -> 2 Brick). This suggests Player 1 either doesn't value Wheat highly, or they don't see enough value in my offers.\n    *   Player 1 offered 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore. This indicates Player 1 *might* value Ore highly, but also wants a significant amount of a medium-value resource for it. I rejected it because 5 Sheep (65 value) for 1 Ore (35 value) is a bad deal for me.\n    *   Player 1's latest offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick. This is a very good deal for me. My 1 Ore (35 value) for their 2 Brick (44 value) results in a +9 value gain.\n4.  **Assessing Offers:** Each offer needs to be evaluated based on the net change in total resource value.\n    *   My previous offers (e.g., 7 Wheat for 1 Ore = 35 for 35; 10 Wheat for 2 Brick = 50 for 44) were either value-neutral or slightly negative for me, and Player 1 still rejected them. This implies Player 1 is looking for clearer value gains or different resource types.\n5.  **Strategy moving forward:**\n    *   Prioritize accepting offers that significantly increase my total value, especially if they involve trading away my lowest-value resources for higher-value ones.\n    *   Be willing to trade away Wheat and Wood.\n    *   Be very careful with Ore and Brick, unless the return is excellent.\n    *   Player 1 has demonstrated they are willing to offer higher-value resources (Ore, Brick). The current offer is favorable.\n\nPlayer 1 offered: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick.\nMy value: -1 Ore (35) = -35\nIncoming value: +2 Brick (22*2) = +44\nNet value change: +44 - 35 = +9. This is a positive value gain for me.\n\nMy current resources are: Wheat: 21 (105), Wood: 12 (96), Sheep: 19 (247), Brick: 18 (396), Ore: 11 (385). Total: 1229.\nIf I accept: Wheat: 21, Wood: 12, Sheep: 19, Brick: 18+2=20, Ore: 11-1=10. Total value: (21*5) + (12*8) + (19*13) + (20*22) + (10*35) = 105 + 96 + 247 + 440 + 350 = 1238.\n1238 - 1229 = +9.\n\nThis aligns with my goal of increasing total value.\n\n[Accept]",
