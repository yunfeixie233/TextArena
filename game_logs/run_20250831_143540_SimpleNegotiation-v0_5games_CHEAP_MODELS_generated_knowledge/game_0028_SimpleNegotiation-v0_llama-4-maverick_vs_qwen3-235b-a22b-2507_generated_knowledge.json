      "response": "To generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation that applies to my situation, let's analyze the current state of my resources and the task at hand.\n\n### Current Resources and Values:\n1. Wheat: 8 units, Value: 5\n2. Wood: 23 units, Value: 11\n3. Sheep: 23 units, Value: 13\n4. Brick: 21 units, Value: 20\n5. Ore: 12 units, Value: 36\n\n### Task:\nThe goal is to increase the total value of my resources through trading.\n\n### Key Principles, Strategies, or Insights:\n\n1. **Identify Overvalued and Undervalued Resources**: Compare the values of different resources to identify which ones are more valuable and which are less valuable. In my case, Ore is the most valuable resource (Value: 36), and Wheat is the least valuable (Value: 5).\n\n2. **Trade Less Valuable Resources for More Valuable Ones**: The strategy should be to offer resources with lower values and request resources with higher values. \n\n3. **Assess Current Holdings**: I have a significant quantity of Wood, Sheep, and Brick, moderately high quantities of Ore, and a relatively lower quantity of Wheat.\n\n4. **Diversification vs. Specialization**: While diversifying resources can be beneficial, the primary goal here is to increase the total value. Thus, focusing on acquiring more valuable resources is key.\n\n5. **Opportunistic Trading**: Be prepared to make trades that might not seem immediately beneficial if they set up future advantageous trades.\n\n### Applying the Generated Knowledge:\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I should aim to trade my less valuable resources for more valuable ones. \n\nGiven my resources:\n- The least valuable resource I have is Wheat (Value: 5), followed by Wood (Value: 11), and then Sheep (Value: 13). \n- The most valuable resources are Ore (Value: 36) and Brick (Value: 20).\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some of my less valuable resources (Wheat, Wood, or Sheep) for more valuable resources like Ore or Brick. However, I already have a considerable amount of Brick and Ore.\n\nLet's examine a potential trade:\n- Offering some Sheep (Value: 13) and/or Wood (Value: 11) for Ore (Value: 36) could be beneficial if I can get a good rate.\n\nSince it's the first turn and there are no incoming offers, I will make an offer. Let's propose a trade that might be attractive to others and beneficial to me.\n\n### Trading Decision:\nLet's offer 3 Sheep (Value: 13) and 2 Wood (Value: 11) for 1 Ore (Value: 36). The total value offered is (3*13) + (2*11) = 39 + 22 = 61. The value requested is 1*36 = 36. This trade is not favorable as per the initial thought since I'm offering more value than I'm getting. Let's reconsider.\n\nA more balanced initial offer could be: \n- '[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nHere, I'm offering (2*5) + (1*13) = 10 + 13 = 23 in value for 1*36 = 36 in Ore. This trade seems more reasonable as I'm getting a higher value resource for a lower value one.\n\nLet's make the trade offer:\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThis action is in the required format and follows the generated knowledge by attempting to trade less valuable resources for a more valuable one.\n\n### Action:\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'",

Thus, we should look to exchange resources of lower value for those of higher value.\n\n2. **Assessing Offers**: Any offer should increase the total value of resources held by Player 0. Given the values, trading away resources with lower values for those with higher values is beneficial.\n\n3. **Resource Valuation**:\n   - The highest value resource is Ore (Value = 36), followed by Brick (Value = 20), Sheep (Value = 13), Wood (Value = 11), and then Wheat (Value = 5).\n\n4. **Negotiation Strategy**:\n   - Since Player 1 rejected the initial offer, it indicates that either the offer was not favorable for Player 1, or Player 1 does not have the requested resource (1 Ore) in sufficient quantity or is not willing to trade it at that rate.\n   - We should reassess our resources and consider alternative trades that might be more appealing to Player 1.\n\n5. **Analysis of Previous Offer**:\n   - The rejected offer was 2 Wheat (2*5 = 10), 1 Sheep (1*13 = 13) -> 1 Ore (1*36 = 36). The total value given away is 23, and the value received is 36. The net gain is 13, which is positive, indicating the trade was potentially beneficial for Player 0.\n\n### Applying Knowledge to Make a Trading Decision\n\nGiven that the previous offer was rejected and considering our goal to increase the total value of resources, let's analyze potential trades.\n\n1. **Alternative Trades**:\n   - We can consider offering resources with lower values in exchange for Ore or Brick, as they have higher values.\n\n2. **New Offer**:\n   - Let's think about offering some Wheat (Value = 5) and/or Wood (Value = 11) for Ore. For example, offering 3 Wheat (3*5 = 15) and 1 Wood (1*11 = 11) for 1 Ore (1*36 = 36) gives a net gain of 10 (36 - (15 + 11)).\n\n3. **Formulating the New Offer**:\n   - Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore.\n\nLet's format this as per the required action tokens:\n- '[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]'\n\n### Decision\n\nSince there's no incoming offer to accept or deny, and we've formulated a new offer based on our analysis, the action will be to make this new offer.\n\n### Action\n'[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]'",

      "response": "To tackle this task effectively, let's first analyze the current situation and the resources available.\n\n### Current Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: 8 units, Value: 5\n- Wood: 23 units, Value: 11\n- Sheep: 23 units, Value: 13\n- Brick: 21 units, Value: 20\n- Ore: 12 units, Value: 36\n\n### Objective:\nThe goal is to increase the total value of the resources held.\n\n### Analysis of Current Holdings:\n1. **Total Value Calculation**:\n   - Total value = (8*5) + (23*11) + (23*13) + (21*20) + (12*36)\n   - Total value = 40 + 253 + 299 + 420 + 432 = 1444\n\n2. **Resource Values and Quantities**:\n   - The resources with the highest individual values are Ore (36) and Brick (20), indicating they are highly valued.\n   - Sheep and Wood have moderate values (13 and 11, respectively), and Wheat has the lowest value (5).\n\n3. **Previous Trades and Outcomes**:\n   - Player0 made two offers to Player1: \n     1. 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore (Rejected)\n     2. 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore (Rejected)\n   - Both offers aimed at acquiring Ore, the highest valued resource, by trading lower-valued resources.\n\n### Generating Knowledge:\n1. **Principle of Comparative Advantage**: Trade resources that are less valuable to you for those that are more valuable. Since Ore is the most valuable resource, acquiring it by trading less valuable resources is beneficial.\n\n2. **Assessing Player1's Likely Interests**: Since Player1 rejected offers involving Wheat, Sheep, and Wood for Ore, it suggests that either Player1 does not need Ore that badly or values Wheat, Sheep, and Wood more than expected.\n\n3. **Alternative Trading Strategies**:\n   - Consider offering resources that are abundant or less valuable for resources that are more valuable. \n   - Since Brick is the second most valuable resource and is abundant (21 units), consider if there's an opportunity to trade it or use it as a bargaining chip.\n\n4. **Negotiation Insights**:\n   - Rejections indicate that the offers were not favorable to Player1. Adjust the offer to be more appealing, possibly by including more valuable resources or requesting fewer resources.\n\n### Trading Decision:\nGiven that the previous attempts to trade for Ore were rejected, it's necessary to reconsider the resources being offered and requested. \n\nSince Ore is highly valued, and previous trades were rejected, let's consider a different combination that might be more appealing to Player1. Noting that Brick is the second most valuable resource and we have a considerable amount of it, we can consider using it in a trade. However, directly offering for Ore again might not be effective.\n\nLet's directly offer a trade that involves giving away some of the less relatively valued resources for something more valuable, but adjust our strategy considering the previous rejections.\n\n### Action:\nLet's make a new offer that involves different resources, keeping in mind the goal of increasing total value. We still aim to get Ore, but we adjust our offering.\n\n`[Offer:2 Brick,1 Sheep ->1 Ore]`\n\nThis offer uses Brick, a relatively valuable resource, along with Sheep, to request Ore. The idea is to make the offer more attractive to Player1 by including a more valuable resource (Brick) in the exchange.\n\n### Rationale:\n- We give away 2 Brick (Value: 40) and 1 Sheep (Value: 13), totaling a value of 53.\n- We receive 1 Ore (Value: 36), which means the trade results in a net loss of value (53 - 36 = 17). This is not ideal.\n  \nLet's adjust our strategy to make a more sensible trade.\n\n### Revised Action:\nUpon further consideration, let's directly aim to trade something less valuable for something more valuable.\n\n`[Offer:4 Wheat,2 Wood ->1 Brick]`\n\nHere, we are offering 4 Wheat (Value: 20) and 2 Wood (Value: 22), totaling 42, for 1 Brick (Value: 20). This is still not a good trade as we're giving more value than we're getting.\n\nLet's think about the available resources and the value.\n\n### Final Action for This Turn:\nLet's directly try a simpler and more logical trade.\n\n`[Offer:5 Wheat ->1 Wood]`\n\nThis isn't a great trade as we're giving away Wheat (value 5 per unit) for Wood (value 11 per unit), but it doesn't significantly increase our total value either.\n\nRevisiting our inventory and considering the goal:\n\n`[Offer:3 Sheep,2 Wheat ->1 Brick]`\n\nHere, we give 3 Sheep (Value: 39) and 2 Wheat (Value: 10), totaling 49, for 1 Brick (Value: 20). This trade is not favorable.\n\nLet's directly make a trade that we think is beneficial.\n\nGiven the context and the format required for the answer, and after evaluating different possible trades, let's simplify:\n\nThe final answer is: `[Offer:2 Wood,3 Wheat ->1 Brick]`",

This could indicate that either Player1 is not interested in the proposed trades or is waiting for a more favorable offer.\n\n### Application of Knowledge:\nGiven that the objective is to increase the total value of resources and considering the negotiation history, let's analyze the previous offers and their implications:\n\n1. **Previous Offers Analysis**:\n   - The first offer (2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore) was rejected. This implies giving up (2*5) + (1*13) = 23 for 36 (1 Ore). The net gain is 13, which is a good trade.\n   - The subsequent offers followed a similar logic, attempting to get Ore for other resources.\n\n2. **New Offer Strategy**:\n   - Since Ore is the most valuable resource and we have already made offers to acquire it, let's reassess what we're offering.\n   - We could consider offering resources that are less valuable to us in greater quantities or finding a different resource that Player1 might be interested in giving up.\n\n3. **Alternative Strategy**:\n   - Given that our previous offers were rejected, it's possible that Player1 does not have Ore to spare or is not interested in our offers.\n   - We could consider waiting for Player1 to make an offer or looking for an alternative strategy that involves different resources.\n\n### Trading Decision:\nLet's make a new offer that still focuses on acquiring Ore but adjusts the resources we're willing to give up. Considering our resources and the value, let's offer something that might be more appealing or at least continue our strategy with a slight adjustment.\n\nLet's consider offering: `[Offer: 4 Brick, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nHere, we're giving up (4*20) + (1*11) = 80 + 11 = 91 for 36 (1 Ore). This trade is not favorable as it results in a net loss. Let's reconsider.\n\nAn alternative could be: `[Offer: 1 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis involves giving up (1*11) + (2*13) = 11 + 26 = 37 for 36. This is still not a good trade due to the slight loss.\n\nLet's directly evaluate a potentially better offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis means giving up (5*5) + (2*13) = 25 + 26 = 51 for 36. This is not a good trade.\n\nRevisiting our strategy, a more reasonable trade might involve directly proposing something that's relatively less costly. \n\nHowever, since our objective is to increase the total value and Ore is the most valuable, let's directly propose a trade that's somewhat reasonable, though it might still be a bit of a loss: `[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nHere, we're giving up (2*11) + (1*13) = 22 + 13 = 35 for 36. This results in a net gain of 1, which is a slight improvement.\n\nThus, our next action is: `[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's proceed with this offer. \n\nAction: `[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge: Key Principles and Strategies for Resource Trading\n\n1. **Net Value Calculation is Paramount**:  \n   In zero-sum resource trading, a trade is beneficial *only* if the **total value of received resources exceeds the value of resources given away**. Always calculate net value change (received \u2212 given) before accepting. Emotional or speculative \"bargaining\" without this analysis leads to losses.\n\n2. **Exploit Asymmetric Valuations**:  \n   If the counterparty undervalues a resource you hold (e.g., Ore) relative to what they offer, aggressively trade it for higher aggregate value. Here, Player 0 persistently requests Ore but offers disproportionately high-value packages (Brick/Wood), revealing their urgent need.\n\n3. **Escalating Concessions Signal Leverage**:  \n   Player 0\u2019s offers have evolved:  \n   - Turn 1: Net **\u22129** (reject correctly)  \n   - Turn 3: Net **+37** (should have accepted; rejection was suboptimal)  \n   - Turn 4: Net **+88** (highly favorable)  \n   Their worsening terms indicate desperation. Delaying acceptance risks them retracting offers or the game ending.\n\n4. **Resource Saturation vs. Scarcity**:  \n   You hold **13 Ore** (high stock, value = 33 each), but Ore\u2019s value is fixed\u2014its \"scarcity\" doesn\u2019t matter here. Prioritize converting excess high-stock resources (Ore) into undervalued assets (Brick/Wood) *if net value rises*.\n\n5. **Short-Term Maximization Over Speculation**:  \n   With only 10 total turns, guaranteed gains (>80 value in this offer) outweigh hypothetical \"better deals.\" Rejecting this risks losing value if Player 0 switches tactics.\n\n### Applied Decision\n- **Current Offer Analysis**:  \n  - Received: **4 Brick (4 \u00d7 28 = 112) + 1 Wood (9) = 121 value**  \n  - Given: **1 Ore (33 value)**  \n  - **Net Gain: 121 \u2212 33 = +88**  \n  This is the most profitable offer yet\u2014significantly increasing total resource value.\n\n- **Why Accept Now?**  \n  Rejecting sacrifices an 88-value gain for uncertain future offers. Player 0\u2019s pattern shows declining patience (rejections led to better terms), but with limited turns, locking in value immediately is optimal. Your Ore surplus (13) makes sacrificing 1 low-impact.\n\n[Accept]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nTo make an informed trading decision, let's first analyze the current situation and resources.\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 8 units, Value: 5\n   - Wood: 23 units, Value: 11\n   - Sheep: 23 units, Value: 13\n   - Brick: 21 units, Value: 20\n   - Ore: 12 units, Value: 36\n\n2. **Previous Trades and Outcomes:**\n   - Offered 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep for 1 Ore: Rejected\n   - Offered 3 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Ore: Rejected\n   - Offered 2 Brick, 1 Sheep for 1 Ore: Rejected\n   - Offered 4 Brick, 1 Wood for 1 Ore: Accepted\n\n3. **Key Principles and Strategies:**\n   - **Value Maximization:** The goal is to increase the total value of resources.\n   - **Resource Valuation:** Ore has the highest value (36), followed by Brick (20), Sheep (13), Wood (11), and Wheat (5).\n   - **Trade Evaluation:** Assess trades based on the gain or loss in total resource value.\n   - **Negotiation Tactics:** Adjust offers based on previous responses. If an offer is rejected, consider what was offered/requested and adjust accordingly.\n\n4. **Analysis of Last Trade:**\n   - Gave up 4 Brick (Value: 80) and 1 Wood (Value: 11) for 1 Ore (Value: 36). This trade resulted in a net loss of value (80 + 11 - 36 = 55). Although it was accepted, it decreased the total value of resources held.\n\n5. **Insights for Next Move:**\n   - Since Ore is highly valued and we now have fewer resources of lower value (Brick and Wood), the next trade should aim to either gain more Ore or conserve high-value resources.\n   - Given that the last trade resulted in a loss, we should be cautious and try to propose trades that are more balanced or beneficial.\n\n### Applying Knowledge to Make a Trading Decision\n\n1. **Current Status Post Last Trade:**\n   - Wheat: 8 units\n   - Wood: 22 units (lost 1)\n   - Sheep: 23 units\n   - Brick: 17 units (lost 4)\n   - Ore: 13 units (gained 1)\n\n2. **Decision Making:**\n   - To avoid further diminishing the total value, we should look for trades that either gain high-value resources or do not significantly reduce our current total value.\n   - One potential strategy is to offer resources with lower values in exchange for Ore or other high-value resources.\n\n3. **Proposed Trade:**\n   - Considering the values, offering some Wheat (low value) and possibly some Wood or Sheep (moderate value) for Ore could be a strategy. However, we need to be mindful of the quantities and ensure that the trade does not significantly disadvantage us.\n   - An example could be: Offering 2 Wheat, 2 Sheep for 1 Ore. Here, we're giving up Wheat (Value: 10) and Sheep (Value: 26), totaling 36, for Ore (Value: 36). This trade is value-neutral but doesn't increase our total value.\n\n4. **Action:**\n   - Given the current situation and the need to increase the total value of resources, let's propose a trade that could potentially be beneficial or at least not detrimental.\n\nLet's propose: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n- Offered Value: 3 Wheat (15) + 2 Wood (22) = 37\n- Requested Value: 1 Ore (36)\n\nThis trade is slightly unfavorable in terms of value but is close to being neutral. It might be accepted given that it's not far off from a fair trade.\n\nThus, the action is: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`.",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \nIn resource-based negotiation games, several key principles apply:\n\n1. **Value Asymmetry**: The core of profitable trades lies in differences in perceived or actual value between players. Since each player may value resources differently (based on their goals or position), exchanging resources where one player has surplus and another has high need can create mutual benefit.\n\n2. **Resource Valuation**: In this game, I know the exact point value of each resource:  \n   - Wheat: 5 (low value)  \n   - Wood: 9 (low-medium)  \n   - Sheep: 14 (medium)  \n   - Brick: 28 (high)  \n   - Ore: 33 (highest)  \n\n   Ore is the most valuable resource, so trading it away should yield significant returns. Conversely, acquiring Ore is highly beneficial if done efficiently.\n\n3. **Opportunity Cost**: Giving up a high-value resource like Ore should only happen if the return compensates adequately. For example, trading 1 Ore should ideally gain multiple lower-value resources whose combined value exceeds 33.\n\n4. **Supply and Demand (Relative Scarcity)**:  \n   - I have 13 Ore (high-value, scarce), making me a key supplier.  \n   - I have 24 Wood (abundant), 17 Sheep (moderate), 9 Brick (moderate), and 7 Wheat (low).  \n   - Thus, I can leverage my surplus Wood and Wheat in trades, while conserving Brick and Ore unless high value is returned.\n\n5. **Trade Ratios and Efficiency**:  \n   To trade Ore profitably:  \n   - 1 Ore = 33 value. To break even, I need resources totaling >33.  \n   - For example, 4 Brick (value 28 each) = 112, so giving 1 Ore (33) for 4 Brick (112) is extremely favorable (net gain: +79). This explains why I accepted the prior offer: 1 Ore for 4 Brick and 1 Wood (28\u00d74 + 9 = 121) \u2192 net gain: 121 - 33 = +88.\n\n6. **Player Behavior Analysis**:  \n   Player 0 has consistently offered increasing value to obtain 1 Ore:\n   - First: 2 Wheat + 1 Sheep = 10 + 14 = 24 \u2192 too low\n   - Then: 3 Wheat + 1 Wood = 15 + 9 = 24 \u2192 still low\n   - Then: 2 Brick + 1 Sheep = 56 + 14 = 70 \u2192 better, but 2 Brick is 56, so net gain 70 - 33 = 37\n   - Then: 4 Brick + 1 Wood = 112 + 9 = 121 \u2192 net gain 88 \u2192 I accepted\n   This shows Player 0 is highly motivated for Ore and raising bids.\n\n7. **Future Strategy**:  \n   - Ore is valuable, but if Player 0 is willing to trade large amounts of high-value Brick for it, I can continue leveraging my Ore surplus.\n   - However, once Ore is depleted, I lose this leverage. Need to balance short-term gain with long-term flexibility.\n   - My Wood and Wheat are relatively low value and abundant\u2014ideal for offering in bundles.\n\nPlayer 0\u2019s latest offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood \u2192 1 Ore  \nValue offered to me: 3\u00d75 + 2\u00d79 = 15 + 18 = 33  \nValue I give: 1\u00d733 = 33  \nNet gain: 0\n\nThis is a break-even trade\u2014no benefit. Given that I already traded 1 Ore for a much better return previously, accepting this would devalue my leverage.\n\nTherefore, **this offer is not favorable**\u2014only worth accepting if I were desperate for Wheat or Wood, which I am not (I have plenty of both).\n\nDecision:  \nSince the offer is not profitable and I have no incentive to make a new offer at this time (no immediate need), I will **deny** the current offer and wait for a better one.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "To address the task effectively, let's first analyze the current situation and then generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation.\n\n### Current Situation\n\n- Resources and their quantities: Wheat (8), Wood (23), Sheep (23), Brick (21), Ore (12)\n- Values associated with each resource: Wheat (5), Wood (11), Sheep (13), Brick (20), Ore (36)\n- Recent trades:\n  - Offered 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep for 1 Ore (Rejected)\n  - Offered 3 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Ore (Rejected)\n  - Offered 2 Brick, 1 Sheep for 1 Ore (Rejected)\n  - Offered 4 Brick, 1 Wood for 1 Ore (Accepted)\n  - Offered 3 Wheat, 2 Wood for 1 Ore (Rejected)\n\n### Generating Knowledge\n\n1. **Understanding Resource Values**: The value of resources is a critical factor. Ore is the most valuable resource (Value: 36), followed by Brick (20), Sheep (13), Wood (11), and Wheat (5).\n\n2. **Trade Strategy**: To increase the total value of resources, it's beneficial to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones. The successful trade (4 Brick, 1 Wood for 1 Ore) indicates that giving up resources worth (4*20 + 1*11) = 91 for 1 Ore worth 36 was not beneficial in terms of immediate value comparison. However, it might be part of a larger strategy or due to the lack of better options.\n\n3. **Analyzing Past Trades**: \n   - The rejections indicate that the offers were not favorable to Player 1. \n   - The accepted trade (4 Brick, 1 Wood for 1 Ore) suggests that Player 1 was looking to acquire Brick and Wood, possibly valuing them highly or needing them.\n\n4. **Negotiation Principles**: \n   - **Mutual Benefit**: Trades should ideally benefit both parties.\n   - **Understanding the Counterpart**: Player 1's acceptance of the offer involving Brick and Wood suggests they value these resources.\n\n5. **Current Resource Status**:\n   - After the last accepted trade, the quantities are: Wheat (8), Wood (22), Sheep (23), Brick (17), Ore (13)\n\n### Applying the Generated Knowledge\n\nTo make a trading decision, let's look at the current quantities and values:\n- Total initial value = (8*5) + (23*11) + (23*13) + (21*20) + (12*36) = 40 + 253 + 299 + 420 + 432 = 1444\n- After the accepted trade: (8*5) + (22*11) + (23*13) + (17*20) + (13*36) = 40 + 242 + 299 + 340 + 468 = 1389\n\nThe last trade actually decreased the total value from 1444 to 1389.\n\n### Decision\n\nTo improve, let's consider trading resources that are less valuable for Ore or other more valuable resources. We can look at offering Wheat and/or Wood for more valuable resources.\n\nLet's make an offer that involves giving up some Wheat (least valuable resource) and possibly some Wood for Ore, since Ore is highly valued.\n\n**Proposed Trade**: Offer 2 Wheat, 2 Wood for 1 Ore.\n\nThis trade involves giving up resources worth (2*5 + 2*11) = 32 for 1 Ore worth 36, which is a positive gain in value.\n\nThe action in the required format: `[Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's execute this action.\n\n`[Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`",
