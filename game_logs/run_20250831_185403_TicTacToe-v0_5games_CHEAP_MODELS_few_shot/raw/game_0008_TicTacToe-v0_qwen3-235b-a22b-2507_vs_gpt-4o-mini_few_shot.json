      "observation": "\n[GAME] You are Player 0 in Tic Tac Toe.\nYour goal is to win three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the board.\nOn your turn, you should select the square number (0-8) you want to put your mark in next.\nAs Player 0, you will be 'O', while your opponent is 'X'.\n\nHere are some examples of good Tic Tac Toe decisions:\n\nExample 1: Player sees opponent has two X's in the top row (positions 0 and 1). They immediately play '[2]' to block the winning move.\n\nExample 2: Player has two O's diagonally (positions 0 and 4). They play '[8]' to complete the diagonal and win the game.\n\nExample 3: Early in the game, player chooses '[4]' to take the center position, which gives the most strategic options for creating multiple winning threats.\n\nExample 4: Player sees opponent controls center and one corner. They take the opposite corner '[8]' to prevent opponent from creating a fork.\n\nFormat your move as '[number]' where number is 0-8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] To maximize my chances of winning, I will take the center position as 'X' to create multiple threats. \n\nI will play '[0]'.\n\n[0] \n\n Current Board:\n\n  X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n  3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n  6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To maximize my chances of winning and to create multiple threats, I will play '[2]'.\n\n[2] \n\nCurrent Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [6]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To maximize my chances of winning and to create a winning opportunity, I will play '[3]'.\n\n[3] \n\nCurrent Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To maximize my chances of winning, I will play '[5]' to complete the vertical line. \n\n[5] \n\nCurrent Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[7]'\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[7]'",
