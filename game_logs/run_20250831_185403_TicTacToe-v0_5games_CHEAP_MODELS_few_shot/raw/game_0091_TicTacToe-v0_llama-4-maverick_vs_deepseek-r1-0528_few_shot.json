They immediately play '[2]' to block the winning move.\n\nExample 2: Player has two O's diagonally (positions 0 and 4).

The available moves are all the squares from 0 to 8.\n\nAccording to Example 3, taking the center position early in the game provides the most strategic options for creating multiple winning threats.\n\nThe center position is square number 4. \n\nI'll play '[4]'.\n\nSo, my move is: [4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [GAME ANALYSIS]\nAs Player 1 (X) facing an opponent (O) in the center (position 4), my priorities are:\n- Taking a corner position (0, 2, 6, 8) is optimal, as corners offer flexibility for multiple winning paths and align with high-win-rate strategies.\n- Position 0 is the top-left corner and creates potential winning opportunities:\n  * Horizontal threat with positions 1-2\n  * Vertical threat with positions 3-6\n  * Diagonal threat with positions 4-8 (though O controls center)\n- All corners are equally viable, but selecting 0 maintains symmetry without strategic disadvantages.\n\n[EFFECT ON OPPONENT]\n- Forces them to respond to my corner threat instead of developing new threats\n- Avoids giving O opportunities to create early forks by leaving corners open\n\n[FORMATTED MOVE]\n[0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To make my next strategic move, I'll analyze the current state of the board.\n\nThe current board has 'X' in position 0 and 'O' in position 4. The available moves are squares 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nFirst, I'll assess the potential threats and opportunities:\n\n1. 'X' has taken the top-left corner (position 0), which creates potential winning opportunities:\n   - Horizontal threat with positions 1-2\n   - Vertical threat with positions 3-6\n   - Diagonal threat with positions 4-8\n\n2. My 'O' is in the center (position 4), which provides flexibility for multiple winning paths.\n\nTo counter 'X's corner strategy and maintain flexibility, I should prioritize a move that:\n- Supports a potential winning line\n- Challenges 'X's position\n- Keeps options open for future moves\n\nConsidering the available moves and the need to respond to 'X's corner play, I'll examine the corners and other strategic positions.\n\nSince 'X' has taken the top-left corner (0), taking the opposite corner (8) could be a good strategy to:\n- Counter 'X's diagonal potential\n- Keep the possibility of a diagonal win open for myself\n- Not let 'X' have a straightforward path to creating a fork\n\nThe available corners are 2, 6, and 8. Taking 8 is a good response as it:\n- Is diagonally opposite to 'X's corner\n- Maintains symmetry and keeps 'X' from having an easy fork\n\nThus, I'll choose the bottom-right corner, which is position 8.\n\nSo, my move is: [8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] [GAME ANALYSIS]\nAs Player 1 (X), the board shows:\n- My mark at corner position 0\n- Opponent controls center (4) and bottom-right corner (8)\n- No immediate winning threats exist, but I must create opportunities to form three in a row.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n1. **Opponent's position**: They occupy a diagonal (positions 4 and 8). Though blocked at 0, leaving the anti-diagonal (positions 2-4-6) vulnerable if not addressed. Need to prevent a potential fork.\n   - If opponent gains another corner, they can threaten multiple wins later.\n\n2. **Optimal play**:  \n   - **Corner supremacy**: Corners (0, 2, 6, 8) are critical.
