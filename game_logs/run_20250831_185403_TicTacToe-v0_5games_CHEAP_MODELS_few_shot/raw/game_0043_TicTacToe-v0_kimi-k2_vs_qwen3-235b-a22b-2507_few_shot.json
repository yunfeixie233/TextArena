More importantly, it creates an immediate threat along the middle column (cells 1-O and 4-O) if paired with 7. Since 7 is still available, Player 1 would have no legal way to block both 3\u20137 and 4\u20137 at the same time if I also take 7 later. But right now the only immediate winning option is 7\u2014because I already own 4 and 8 forms a diagonal (4\u20138 is blocked by X at 2 anyway) and 1\u20134\u20137.
