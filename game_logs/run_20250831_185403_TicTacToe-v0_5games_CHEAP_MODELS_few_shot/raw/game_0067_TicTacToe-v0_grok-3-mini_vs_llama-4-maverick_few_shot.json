They immediately play '[2]' to block the winning move.\n\nExample 2: Player has two O's diagonally (positions 0 and 4). They play '[8]' to complete the diagonal and win the game.\n\nExample 3: Early in the game, player chooses '[4]' to take the center position, which gives the most strategic options for creating multiple winning threats.\n\nExample 4: Player sees opponent controls center and one corner. They take the opposite corner '[8]' to prevent opponent from creating a fork.\n\nFormat your move as '[number]' where number is 0-8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] To respond to the current state of the board, let's analyze the situation:\n\nThe current board is:\n \n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nSince Player 0 (O) has placed their symbol in cell 4, it's my turn as Player 1 (X). My goal is to make a strategic move that will allow me to potentially win or at least counter their strategy.\n\nFollowing the examples given and general Tic Tac Toe strategy, taking the center is a strong initial move, but since the center is already occupied by 'O', I need to choose a different strategic location.\n\nExample 3 suggests taking the center, but that's not available. However, it's also strategic to take a corner to provide multiple possibilities for the next move and potentially create a \"fork\" that could lead to a win. \n\nGiven that 'O' is in the center, I will choose a corner. The available corners are 0, 2, 6, and 8. Let's choose one of these.\n\nI'll select '[8]' as my move, aiming to take a corner and keep my options open for creating a potential fork or responding to 'O's next move.\n\nMy move: [8]\n\nThe expected board after my move:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [0]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To respond to the current state of the board, let's analyze the situation:\n\nThe current board is:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nPlayer 0 (O) has now placed their symbol in cell 0. As Player 1 (X), I need to consider the next strategic move.\n\nSince 'O' is now in the top left corner (0) and the center (4), and I am in the bottom right corner (8), I need to consider the next best move to either counter 'O's potential win or set up for a potential win.\n\nFirst, let's check for any immediate threats from 'O'. With 'O' in positions 0 and 4, they could potentially win if they get their next 'O' in position 8, but that's taken by me. However, they could also potentially create a strong position by controlling the top row or the left column.\n\nMy 'X' is in position 8. To counter 'O's strategy and create a potential fork or block their winning line, I need to analyze the available moves.\n\nThe available moves are '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'. \n\nOne of the strategic options is to take another corner or a position that gives me flexibility for my next move. Since I already have a corner (8), taking another corner could be beneficial.\n\nLet's consider the corners and other available positions. The available corners are 2 and 6. \n\nTaking corner '[2]' could be a good move as it gives me the potential to create a diagonal or be part of a future winning line, and it also somewhat mirrors my existing 'X' in the corner.\n\nMy move: [2]\n\nThe expected board after my move:\n\n O | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nLet's see how the game unfolds.\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | X | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  To respond to the current state of the board, let's analyze the situation:\n\nThe current board is:\n\n O | X | 2  \n---+---+---  \n 3 | O | 5  \n---+---+---  \n 6 | 7 | X  \n\nAs Player 0 (O), I have marks in positions 0 and 4.
