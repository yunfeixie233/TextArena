This creates immediate threats and leverages the strategic value of corners for multiple winning possibilities. Remaining corners are 2 and 6; position 2 (top-right) is selected to directly threaten the top row (0, 1, 2). If unblocked, this could win next turn.

My top priority is to block this winning move to prevent defeat. Additionally, playing in position 1 would place my O in the middle column alongside my existing O at position 4, setting up a potential threat for two in a row in that column.
