My opponent has placed 'X' in position [6].\n\n2. **Look for Immediate Threats or Opportunities**:\n   - My opponent has just started with one 'X', so there's no immediate threat from them yet.\n   - I should look to develop my position further.\n\n3. **Apply Strategic Principles**:\n   - Since I've taken the center, my next goal is to develop my pieces (or 'O's) in a way that creates multiple possibilities for winning.\n   - A good strategy is to place my next 'O' in a position that is likely to be part of a winning line and also puts pressure on my opponent to respond.\n\n4. **Analyze Available Moves**:\n   - Playing in a corner could be a good strategy as it gives me the possibility to create a diagonal or potentially a row/column if my opponent allows it.\n   - Corners are [0], [2], [8]. Since [6] is taken by 'X', I might consider the opposite corner of [6], which is [2], as a strategic move to potentially create a fork or prepare for a diagonal.\n\n5. **Decision**:\n   - I'll choose a corner that is available and seems strategically advantageous. Let's go with **[2]** as it is a corner and puts me in a good position for future moves, potentially creating opportunities for a diagonal or other winning combinations.\n\nMy move is: [2]\n\nCurrent Board after my move will be:\n\n 0 | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | 8 \n\nLet's see how the game unfolds.\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] Looking at the current board:\n\nO | 1 | 2  \n---+---+---  \n3 | O | 5  \n---+---+---  \nX | 7 | 8  \n\nI see that Player 0 has two O\u2019s on the diagonal (0, 4).  \nWith one more O in corner 8 that diagonal (0-4-8) would give three-in-a-row for O, so 8 is immediately winning for O if it\u2019s left open.  \nI must block that threat right now.  \n\nMy only legal move that stops 0-4-8 is to take the final square of that diagonal.\n\nMy move is: [8]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] To decide my next move, let's analyze the current state of the board and apply the principles from the given examples.\n\nCurrent Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n\n1. **Assess the Current State**: \n   - I've occupied positions [0] and [4] with 'O'. \n   - My opponent has 'X' in positions [6] and [8].\n\n2. **Look for Immediate Threats or Opportunities**:\n   - My opponent has blocked my potential diagonal win by placing 'X' in [8].\n   - I should now look to create a new winning opportunity or block their potential wins.\n\n3. **Apply Strategic Principles**:\n   - Since my diagonal plan was blocked, I should now focus on other potential winning lines.\n   - I should look to develop my next 'O' in a way that puts pressure on my opponent and creates new possibilities.\n\n4. **Analyze Available Moves**:\n   - Available moves are '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', and '[7]'.\n   - I can play in [1] or [3] to potentially start a new row or column.\n   - Playing in [1] could lead to a potential win if I can get [2] as well, creating a row.\n   - Playing in [3] could lead to a potential win if I can get the next position in that column.\n\n5. **Decision**:\n   - Let's analyze the move that could potentially create a strong chance of winning. If I play in **[1]**, it starts to build a potential row or puts pressure on my opponent to respond to the growing threat in the top row.\n   - However, I should also consider the response of my opponent and how it might limit their next move or create an opportunity for a counterattack.\n\nMy move is: [1]\n\nThis will be an interesting next step, as it puts pressure on the top row and creates a potential threat. \n\nCurrent Board after my move will be:\n\n O | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | X \n\nLet's see how the game unfolds.\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] I see Player 0 has just played [1], giving two O\u2019s in the top row at [0] and [1].  \nThat creates an immediate threat: if O next takes [2] they will complete three-in-a-row across the top and win.  \nI must block this right now.\n\nMy move is: [2]\n[GAME] Player 1 attempted an invalid move.
