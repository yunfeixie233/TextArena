They immediately play '[2]' to block the winning move.\n\nExample 2: Player has two O's diagonally (positions 0 and 4). They play '[8]' to complete the diagonal and win the game.\n\nExample 3: Early in the game, player chooses '[4]' to take the center position, which gives the most strategic options for creating multiple winning threats.\n\nExample 4: Player sees opponent controls center and one corner. They take the opposite corner '[8]' to prevent opponent from creating a fork.\n\nFormat your move as '[number]' where number is 0-8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [4] is the center, which is the most strategic position in Tic Tac Toe. As Player 1 ('X'), my priority now is to take a corner\u2014positions 0, 2, 6, or 8\u2014to maximize winning opportunities since corners control three lines (row, column, diagonal). I choose **position 0** (top-left corner) to establish strong board presence and pressure diagonally toward the opponent's center.  \n\nNext, if my opponent responds weakly (e.g., on an edge like 1/3/5/7), I can threaten immediate forks. If they take another corner, I\u2019ll block or force a draw. Corner openings are optimal after the center is occupied.  \n\n**[0]**\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [COMMENT] Apologies for the oversight. As Player 1 (\u2018X\u2019), I\u2019ve reassessed the board: opponent's \u2018O\u2019 occupies the center (4), making corners the optimal strategic choice. Taking corner position **0** accomplishes:\n- Secures control of three winning lines (row 0, column 0, and diagonal 0-4-8)\n- Forces opponent to react defensively\n- Creates potential fork opportunities after subsequent moves  \n\nThis follows classic Tic Tac Toe strategy where controlling corners after losing the center balances board influence.  \n\n**[0]**\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] Now that X has the top-left corner (0) and I hold the center (4), the strongest response is to occupy the opposite corner (8).
