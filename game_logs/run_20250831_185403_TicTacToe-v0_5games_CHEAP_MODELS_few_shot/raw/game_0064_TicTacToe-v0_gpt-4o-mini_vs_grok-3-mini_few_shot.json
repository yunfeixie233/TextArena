They immediately play '[2]' to block the winning move.\n\nExample 2: Player has two O's diagonally (positions 0 and 4). They play '[8]' to complete the diagonal and win the game.\n\nExample 3: Early in the game, player chooses '[4]' to take the center position, which gives the most strategic options for creating multiple winning threats.\n\nExample 4: Player sees opponent controls center and one corner. They take the opposite corner '[8]' to prevent opponent from creating a fork.\n\nFormat your move as '[number]' where number is 0-8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] I\u2019ll start by taking the center position to maximize my strategic options. My move is:\n\n'[4]'\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] I'll take a corner position, as it's a strong strategic choice when the center is already occupied.
