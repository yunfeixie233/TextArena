To counter this, I need to assess the available moves that can help me either block their winning line or create a counter-threat.\n\nNoting that positions 0 and 2 are taken by 'X', my priority should be to block their potential three 'X's in a row on the top. The available move to block this is to place 'O' in position 1.\n\nMy move is: [1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  To continue building my strategy and to potentially secure a win, I need to look for the best opportunity on the board with the current positions in mind.\n\nThe current board is:\n```\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n```\n\nI can see that placing 'X' in position 3 will provide me with a chance to create a vertical threat since I'll have positions 0, 2, and 3 filled with 'X'. \n\nSo, my move is: [3]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'",

They immediately play '[2]' to block the winning move.\n\nExample 2: Player has two O's diagonally (positions 0 and 4). They play '[8]' to complete the diagonal and win the game.\n\nExample 3: Early in the game, player chooses '[4]' to take the center position, which gives the most strategic options for creating multiple winning threats.\n\nExample 4: Player sees opponent controls center and one corner. They take the opposite corner '[8]' to prevent opponent from creating a fork.\n\nFormat your move as '[number]' where number is 0-8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] Since I'm playing as 'O' and it's the first move, I'll follow the strategy of taking the center position to have the most strategic options for creating multiple winning threats.\n\n[4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] To maximize my chances of winning, I will take the corner position which allows for multiple strategies.

Given that I have already taken the center position 4 with 'O', my next move should aim to develop my position further and put pressure on Player 1.\n\nOne of the effective strategies in Tic Tac Toe is to control the corners and the center. Since Player 1 has taken one corner, I will take the opposite corner to maintain balance and keep my options open for creating a \"fork\" or blocking their potential winning lines.\n\nThe opposite corner of 0 is 8.
