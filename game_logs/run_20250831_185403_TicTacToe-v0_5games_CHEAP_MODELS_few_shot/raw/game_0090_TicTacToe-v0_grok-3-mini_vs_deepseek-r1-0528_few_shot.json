Key strategic points:  \n- **Immediate Threat Creation**: Occupying position 2 completes the top row setup (X at 0 and 2), threatening a win in the next move if I take position 1 later.  \n- **Critical Block**: Prevents O from forming a diagonal attack (2-4-6), as taking 2 denies O access to that winning path.  \n- **Corner Priority**: Corners (like 2) retain strategic flexibility for future forks and control multiple lines simultaneously.  \n\nCompared to bottom-left corner (6), top-right (2) offers direct offensive pressure, forcing O to respond defensively.  \n\n**Move: [2]**  \n*(Placing X here builds toward a decisive top-row victory and counters O\u2019s potential plays.)*\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] [GAME ANALYSIS]  \nThe opponent (O) just blocked my top-row win by playing position 1, creating a critical threat:  \n- **Urgent Block Required**: O now has two in column 1 (positions 1 and 4).
