However, since the game has just begun, I'll consider developing my position further.\n\nNoting that the opponent has taken a corner, I could consider taking a position that either prepares to block their potential three in a row or creates a potential winning line for myself.\n\nOne good option is to take a position adjacent to my existing 'O' in the center. Let's examine the available moves.\n\nI can see that taking position '[1]' or '[3]' would be a reasonable move as it starts to develop my position and potentially sets up for a future fork or blocks a potential 'X' line.\n\nLet's choose '[1]'.

However, my current 'O's don't directly block their corners, so I'll focus on developing my own position.\n\nSince I already have two 'O's (1 and 4), I can examine possible ways to create a winning line.
