A good strategy is to potentially create a line or block their potential line. I can consider positions that would either create a possible win for me or block a potential win for Player0.\n\n\nNoting that Player0 has 'O's in positions4 and8, which could be part of a diagonal, I need to be cautious about their potential to complete that diagonal or create another winning line.\n\n\nI'll assess the available moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'. \nTo potentially create a strong position or to respond to their setup, I'll consider playing in a position that either mirrors their 'O' or challenges their control.\n\n\nSince my 'X' is at position0, I'll look to create a possibility by playing in one of the adjacent positions or a strategic corner/position.\n\n\nPlaying '[1]' would be a reasonable move as it starts to build a potential row and puts pressure on the next moves.\n\n\nSo, I'll choose position1.\n\n\n[1]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  [2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To continue the game strategically, I'll analyze the current state of the board.\n\n\nCurrent Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n3 | O |5 \n---+---+---\n6 |7 | O \n\n\nThe current state shows that I've managed to get two 'X's in positions0 and1, while Player0 has 'O's in positions2, 4, and8. My goal now is to either complete a winning line or block their potential winning lines.\n\n\nNoting that I have two 'X's in a row, my next logical move is to try and either complete this row or ensure that I don't let Player0 get an advantageous position.\n\n\nThe available moves are: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'. To potentially win or maintain a strong position, I'll consider completing the row I've started.\n\n\nI'll play '[3]' to potentially create a strong row or force Player0 to react to my new position, though it doesn't directly complete my row. However, it's a strategic move to put pressure.\n\n\nBut, a more optimal move is to directly challenge their setup or continue my row. Since '[2]' is taken by 'O', I'll look at the next best option.\n\n\nPlaying '[5]' could be a good counter-attack or a potential setup for a win, but it doesn't directly help with the current row.\n\n\nThe most straightforward move to continue my initial row (positions0 and1) is to play '[2]', but it's occupied by 'O'. So, the alternative is to look for the next best strategic position.\n\n\nLet's directly think about the best available move: I'll choose '[5]' as it provides a potential to challenge Player0's control and setup, or creates a possibility for a win in the future.\n\n\nSo, I'll play '[5]'.\n[5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n X | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'",
