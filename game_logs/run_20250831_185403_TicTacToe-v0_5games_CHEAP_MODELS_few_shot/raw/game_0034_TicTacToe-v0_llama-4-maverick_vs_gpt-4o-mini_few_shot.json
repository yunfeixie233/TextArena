They immediately play '[2]' to block the winning move.\n\nExample 2: Player has two O's diagonally (positions 0 and 4). They play '[8]' to complete the diagonal and win the game.\n\nExample 3: Early in the game, player chooses '[4]' to take the center position, which gives the most strategic options for creating multiple winning threats.\n\nExample 4: Player sees opponent controls center and one corner. They take the opposite corner '[8]' to prevent opponent from creating a fork.\n\nFormat your move as '[number]' where number is 0-8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To start the game strategically, I'll follow the principle from Example 3, which suggests taking the center position to maximize strategic options.\n\nThe center position is represented by the number 4. So, my move is: [4]\n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] To counter Player 0's move, I will take the center position of the board, which is an excellent strategic location. Since the center is already taken by 'O', I will look for the best move to maximize my potential for winning while blocking my opponent.\n\nPlayer 0 is currently blocking the center position, and I need to take one of the corners to create opportunities for winning.\n\nGiven the available options, I will place my 'X' in position [0] to take one of the corners.\n\nMy move is: [0]\n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nLet's see what Player 0 does next.\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To respond to Player 1's move, I'll analyze the current state of the board.

So, I will place my 'O' in position [8].\n\nMy move is: [8]\n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  To continue my strategy and prevent Player 0 from gaining an advantage, I will focus on creating a winning line. \n\nCurrently, I have 'X' in position 0, and I need to check the available positions to see where I can either block Player 0 or start setting up my win.\n\nThe current board state is:\n```\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O\n```\n\nTo maximize my chances, I need to consider the available moves which are: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'. \n\nPlacing my 'X' in position [2] allows me to create a two-in-a-row with the top row (positions 0 and 2).
