To maximize strategic advantage, I should prioritize controlling corners. Taking cell 2 (top-right corner) achieves two key objectives:  \n1. It blocks Player 1 from completing the top row (0-1-2) on their next turn.  \n2. It creates a potential winning diagonal (2-4-6) for me. If Player 1 doesn't block cell 6 next, I can win immediately afterward.  \n\nThis move also aligns with Example 4 from the instructions (taking an opposite corner to limit the opponent's options).  \n\nMy move: [2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] To maximize my chances of winning, I see that Player 0 (O) has occupied the center and one corner.
