A good strategy is to place my 'X' in a corner to potentially create a fork and challenge the opponent's control.\n\n\nConsidering the available moves, I'll choose a corner. The available corners are positions 0, 2, 6, and 8.\n\n\nI'll select position 8 because it's a corner and gives me flexibility for my next move.\n\n\nMy move is: [8]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  [2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To make my next move, I'll analyze the current board and available moves.\n\n\nCurrent Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\n\nThe opponent has placed their 'O' in position 2. Now, I need to assess the situation and plan my next move.\n\n\nSince I've placed my 'X' in position 8 and the opponent has 'O' in positions 2 and 4, I need to consider my next step carefully.\n\n\nNoticing that the opponent has 'O' in positions 2 and 4, I'll focus on creating a strong counter-position and potentially blocking their future moves.\n\n\nI'll examine the available moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'. \n\n\nPlacing my 'X' in position 7 could be beneficial as it puts pressure on the opponent and potentially sets up a future winning line.\n\n\nHowever, I should prioritize controlling the center's adjacent squares or creating a strong fork.\n\n\nGiven the current state, I'll choose position 5 to place my 'X', as it starts to put pressure on the opponent and opens up potential winning lines.\n\n\nMy move is: [5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To make my next move, I'll analyze the current board and available moves.\n\n\nCurrent Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\n\nThe opponent has placed their 'O' in position 3. Now, I need to assess the situation and plan my next move.\n\n\nSince I've placed my 'X' in positions 0 and 8, and the opponent has 'O' in positions 2, 3, and 4, I need to consider my next step carefully.\n\n\nNoticing that the opponent has 'O' in positions 3 and 4, and is close to creating a strong line, I'll focus on blocking their potential winning lines and creating a counter-attack.\n\n\nI'll examine the available moves: '[1]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'. \n\n\nPlacing my 'X' in position 1 could be beneficial as it puts pressure on the opponent and potentially sets up a future winning line.\n\n\nHowever, the correct last move was [5] and it was not used, instead, the move was made on position 0 (again), this is not a valid move as it was already occupied.\n\n\nLet's re-evaluate: the correct 'X' was on position 0 and 8. I will make the next 'X' on position 5 (or 7, or 1), but the correct move should be on an empty space. I can place my 'X' on position 1 or 5 or 7.\n\n\nI'll select position 1 or 5 or 7. Let's choose the first available option which is 1, but it is not the only valid move.\n\n\nMy move is: [1]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'",
