      "response": "The current offer from Player 0 is: **[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Sheep, 2 Ore]**\n\nLet's analyze this trade from my perspective (Player 1).\n\nMy resources and their values are:\n*   **Wheat:** Qty: 15, Value: 5 (Total Current Value: 15 * 5 = 75)\n*   **Wood:** Qty: 22, Value: 10 (Total Current Value: 22 * 10 = 220)\n*   **Sheep:** Qty: 24, Value: 14 (Total Current Value: 24 * 14 = 336)\n*   **Brick:** Qty: 11, Value: 23 (Total Current Value: 11 * 23 = 253)\n*   **Ore:** Qty: 16, Value: 34 (Total Current Value: 16 * 34 = 544)\n\n**Total current value of my resources:** 75 + 220 + 336 + 253 + 544 = **1428**\n\n**Value of resources I would give up in Player 0's offer:**\n*   3 Sheep * 14 = 42\n*   2 Ore * 34 = 68\n*   **Total value given:** 42 + 68 = **110**\n\n**Value of resources I would receive in Player 0's offer:**\n*   5 Wheat * 5 = 25\n*   5 Wood * 10 = 50\n*   **Total value received:** 25 + 50 = **75**\n\nIn this trade, I would give up 110 in value to receive 75 in value. This is a net loss of 35 (75 - 110 = -35). This offer is not beneficial.\n\nI want to increase the total value of my resources. I should **deny** this offer. Then I will make a counter-offer.\n\nMy strategy is to trade away lower-value items for higher-value items.\nMy lowest value items are Wheat (5) and Wood (10). My highest value items are Ore (34) and Brick (23). Sheep (14) is in the middle.\n\nLet's try to offer some of my cheaper resources for some of their presumably more expensive resources, or at least a trade that is profitable for me.\n\nPlayer 0 offered Wheat and Wood. This suggests they might have a surplus of these or need Sheep and Ore. I don't want to give up Sheep and Ore for their low-value items.\n\nHow about I offer some of my abundant Sheep for some of their potentially higher-value items? Or even try to get some Brick or Ore for my Wheat/Wood/Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get Brick or Ore. I have 15 Wheat and 22 Wood. I have a lot of Sheep (24).\nPerhaps I can offer a combination of Wheat and Wood for some Brick.\n\nConsider:\n*   Offer: 10 Wheat (value 50) + 5 Wood (value 50) = 100 value\n*   Request: 4 Brick (value 92) + 1 Sheep (value 14) = 106 value. This is a small gain.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore.\nI want to get Ore (34) or Brick (23). I am willing to part with Wheat (5), Wood (10), and Sheep (14).\n\nLet's try to gain some Ore, and offer some medium to high quantity of Wheat/Wood/Sheep.\nI have a lot of Sheep and I want to increase my Ore/Brick.\n\nCounter-offer:\n*   Offer: 5 Sheep (5 * 14 = 70)\n*   Request: 2 Ore (2 * 34 = 68) or 3 Brick (3 * 23 = 69)\n\nThis is roughly neutral. I want to make a gain.\n\nHow about I offer a combination of my abundant resources for a higher value resource?\nI have 15 Wheat, 22 Wood, 24 Sheep.\n\nOffer: 8 Wood (8 * 10 = 80) + 1 Sheep (1 * 14 = 14) = Total 94\nRequest: 3 Ore (3 * 34 = 102)\n\nThis is a gain of 8.\n\nLet's refine. I have ample Wheat too.\nOffer: 5 Wood (5 * 10 = 50) + 5 Wheat (5 * 5 = 25) + 1 Sheep (1 * 14 = 14) = Total 89\nRequest: 3 Ore (3 * 34 = 102)\n\nThis is a gain of 13. I have enough of these resources. This seems like a good offer.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 5 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 3 Ore]",
