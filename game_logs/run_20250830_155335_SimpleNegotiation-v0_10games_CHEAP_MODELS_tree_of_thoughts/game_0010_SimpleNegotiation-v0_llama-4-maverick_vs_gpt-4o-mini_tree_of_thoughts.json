      "response": "### Negotiation Game Initial Analysis\n\n#### Resources and Values\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 19, Value: 5\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 21, Value: 12\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 24, Value: 13\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 7, Value: 27\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 22, Value: 32\n\n#### Initial Total Value\n\nTo determine the initial total value, we multiply the quantity of each resource by its value and sum these products.\n\n- Total Value = (19 * 5) + (21 * 12) + (24 * 13) + (7 * 27) + (22 * 32)\n- Total Value = 95 + 252 + 312 + 189 + 704\n- Total Value = 1552\n\n#### Strategy\n\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources through trades. To achieve this, we need to identify which resources are more valuable and try to acquire more of the higher-value resources while possibly trading away lower-value ones.\n\nFrom the given values:\n- **[Wheat]** is the least valuable at 5.\n- **[Ore]** is the most valuable at 32.\n\nA potential strategy could involve trading away some of the lower-value resources for higher-value ones or maintaining a balance that the opponent finds acceptable.\n\n#### Initial Offer Consideration\n\nBefore making an offer, let's consider what we can trade away that is less valuable and what we might request in return that is more valuable.\n\nGiven the current quantities and values, trading away some **[Wheat]** or **[Wood]** for **[Brick]** or **[Ore]** could be beneficial if possible. However, we already have a significant amount of **[Ore]**, so acquiring more might not be as valuable as getting **[Brick]**, which we have less of.\n\nLet's examine a potential trade:\n\nWe have a lot of **[Sheep]** (Value: 13) and could potentially trade some away for **[Brick]** (Value: 27), which is more valuable.\n\n### First Offer\n\nConsidering the above, a potential first offer could be:\n'[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick]'\n\nHowever, to follow the required format more closely and to make a more substantial trade, let's adjust this to fit the format and consider a slightly different offer.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Brick]'\n\nThis offer trades away resources of lower total value for a higher-value resource.\n\nLet's make the offer.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Brick]'",
