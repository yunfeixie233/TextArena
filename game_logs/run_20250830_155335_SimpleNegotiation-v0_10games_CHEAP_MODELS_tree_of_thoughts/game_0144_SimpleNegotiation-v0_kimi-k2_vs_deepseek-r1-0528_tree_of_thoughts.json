      "response": "### Analysis of the Game So Far\n\nLet's first summarize our resources and their current total value:\n\n| Resource | Qty | Value per Unit | Total Value |\n|----------|-----|----------------|-------------|\n| Wheat    | 8   | 5              | 40          |\n| Wood     | 14  | 10             | 140         |\n| Sheep    | 10  | 17             | 170         |\n| Brick    | 24  | 30             | 720         |\n| Ore      | 10  | 36             | 360         |\n| **Total**|     |                | **1430**    |\n\n### Observations from Past Interactions\n\n1. **Player 1's Offers**: They consistently offer 1 Brick for 4-5 Wood, which is not favorable (5 Wood = 50, vs. 1 Brick = 30). They also offered 1 Brick and 1 Ore for 6 Wood and 2 Sheep (6 Wood + 2 Sheep = 60 + 34 = 94, vs. 1 Brick + 1 Ore = 30 + 36 = 66), which is a worse deal.\n\n2. **Our Offers**: We offered bundles (like 6 Wood + 2 Sheep for 3 Ore + 1 Brick) which were likely perceived as too much gain for us (6W+2S = 60 + 34 = 94 offered, 3O+1B = 108 + 30 = 138 requested; net +44 for us). Player 1 rejected this, likely because they saw it as unbalanced.\n\n3. **Player 1 Rejections**: They rejected our offers when the value tilted heavily in our favor. The one-sided deals suggest they're either hoarding Brick/Ore or undervaluing our offers.\n\n4. **Turn Status**: We're at Turn 9 (since 8 interactions have happened). We have one more offer to make.\n\n### Optimal Strategy for Final Offer\n\nGiven that we have only one offer left, we should aim to maximize our total value by acquiring high-value resources (Ore or Brick) at the best rate possible, preferably without over-offering low-value resources.\n\n#### Current Resource Values:\n- Wheat (5), Wood (10), Sheep (17), Brick (30), Ore (36)\n\n#### Possible Trades:\n1. **Offer Sheep + Wheat/Wood for Ore/Brick**: Sheep is our second-highest value resource (17), but we have plenty (10). Offering 2 Sheep + some Wood/Wheat for Ore/Brick might be appealing.\n\n2. **Avoid Offering Brick or Ore**: We have limited Ore (10) and want more Brick/Ore. Better to offer Wheat/Wood/Sheep.\n\n3. **Sweetspot Offer**: Ensure the trade is attractive to Player 1, even if slightly favorable to us. Point approximately balanced trades.\n\n#### Best Offer:\nWe need 2 Ore (72) + 1 Brick (30) = 102 value.  \nWe can offer:  \n- 3 Sheep (51) + 5 Wood (50) = 101 (close to 102, slight edge to us).\n- 4 Sheep (68) + 4 Wheat (20) = 88 (too low).\n- 2 Sheep (34) + 8 Wood (80) = 114 (favor us too much).\n\n**Most balanced seems 3 Sheep + 5 Wood for 2 Ore + 1 Brick (101 vs. 102).**\n\n### Final Offer Decision\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 5 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]",
