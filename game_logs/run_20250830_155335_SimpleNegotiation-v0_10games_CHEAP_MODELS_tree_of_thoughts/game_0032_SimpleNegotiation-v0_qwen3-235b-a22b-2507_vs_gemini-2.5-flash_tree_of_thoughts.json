      "response": "The offer from Player 0 is: `[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 5 Brick, 3 Sheep]`\n\nLet's break down the value of this trade for me (Player 1).\n\n**My Current Resources:**\n*   Wheat: 12 (Value: 5)\n*   Wood: 12 (Value: 8)\n*   Sheep: 5 (Value: 16)\n*   Brick: 11 (Value: 29)\n*   Ore: 23 (Value: 36)\n\n**Value of resources Player 0 is offering to me:**\n*   10 Wheat * 5 = 50\n*   5 Wood * 8 = 40\n    *   **Total Offered Value: 50 + 40 = 90**\n\n**Value of resources Player 0 is requesting from me:**\n*   5 Brick * 29 = 145\n*   3 Sheep * 16 = 48\n    *   **Total Requested Value: 145 + 48 = 193**\n\n**Net Gain/Loss for Player 1 (Me):**\n*   Value Received - Value Given = 90 - 193 = -103\n\nThis offer would result in a significant loss of value for me. I should definitely deny this offer.\n\nNow, I will make a counter-offer that is beneficial to me. My goal is to increase my total resource value. I have a lot of Ore and a decent amount of Brick, which are high-value items for me. Wheat and Wood are low-value items. I'm looking to convert lower-value assets into higher-value assets.\n\nLet's try to get more high-value resources like Ore or Brick, or even Sheep, by offering low-value resources like Wheat and Wood, and maybe some Sheep if the return is good.\n\nI have 23 Ore, with a value of 36. This is my highest value item. I want to keep this unless I get something even better.\nI have 11 Brick, value 29.\nI have 5 Sheep, value 16.\nI have 12 Wood, value 8.\nI have 12 Wheat, value 5.\n\nPlayer 0 asked for Brick and Sheep. This suggests they might value these items. Let me try offering some of my lower value items for their high-value items, or maybe getting more of a resource that is good for me.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick or Ore. I will offer a mix of my lower value items.\n\n**My Offer:**\n*   I want to give away some Wheat and Wood.\n*   I want to receive Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's offer a combination of Wheat, Wood, and maybe some Sheep to get a good number of Brick or Ore.\n\nConsider getting 3 Brick (value 3*29 = 87) for some Wheat and Wood.\nOr 2 Ore (value 2*36 = 72).\n\nLet's make a reasonable offer that benefits me.\nOffer: 10 Wheat (val 50) + 10 Wood (val 80) = 130\nRequest: 3 Brick (val 87) + 2 Sheep (val 32) = 119\n\nThis would be a slight loss for me in value, but gets me more Brick and Sheep. I want to increase my value.\n\nLet's try:\nOffer: 8 Wheat, 8 Wood -> 3 Brick, 1 Sheep\nValue offered: (8 * 5) + (8 * 8) = 40 + 64 = 104\nValue requested: (3 * 29) + (1 * 16) = 87 + 16 = 103\nThis is close to neutral for me.\n\nHow about:\nOffer: 10 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 4 Brick\nValue offered: (10 * 5) + (10 * 8) = 50 + 80 = 130\nValue requested: (4 * 29) = 116\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nI want to **gain value**.\n\nLet's try to get more high-value items by offering mostly low-value items and a small amount of higher-value items if the trade is very good.\n\nMy most valuable items are Ore and Brick. I want *more* of these, not less.\nSheep is mid-value, Wood is low-mid, Wheat is low.\n\nWhat if I offer a lot of my low-value resources to get a decent chunk of higher-value resources?\n\nLet's propose:\n**Offer: 12 Wheat, 12 Wood -> 6 Brick**\n*   Value Offered: (12 * 5) + (12 * 8) = 60 + 96 = 156\n*   Value Requested: (6 * 29) = 174\n*   Net Gain: 174 - 156 = 18. This is a gain for me!\nI have 12 Wheat and 12 Wood, so I can make this offer. This reduces my lowest value items and increases my relatively high-value items (Brick).\n\nThis seems like a good, clear offer.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 12 Wheat, 12 Wood -> 6 Brick]",
