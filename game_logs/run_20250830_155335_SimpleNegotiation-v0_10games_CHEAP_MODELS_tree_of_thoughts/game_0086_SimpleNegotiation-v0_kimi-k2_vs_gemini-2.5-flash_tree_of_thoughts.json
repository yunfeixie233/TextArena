Conversely, Wheat and Wood are least valuable, so I\u2019m happy to give those away in exchange for something better.\n\nI suspect Player 1 may have the complementary needs/obstacles. My plan:\n1. Test the waters by offering excess Wood or Wheat for Brick or Ore at 2:1 or 3:1.\n2. Try to accumulate more Ore and Brick at the expense of Wood and Wheat.\n3. Sheep is moderate; I suspect Player 1 may value Sheep highly (common in trading games), so I can offer a little of it for a much better return.\n\nLet\u2019s open with an exploratory message and invite Player 1 to the table.\n\n[Message] Looks like we both have room to improve. I'm happy to trade Wheat and Wood for a good deal. What's in short supply for you?",
