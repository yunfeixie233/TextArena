You accepted this trade.\n\nNow it's your turn to make an offer.\n\nWhat is your offer? Remember to use the format: `[Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]`\nTry to make an offer that benefits you, similar to the last accepted trade.\nFor example, you have a lot of Wood, and Player 0 might need it. You also have a good amount of Brick. You want to get more high-value items like Ore.\n\nConsider this:\n- You have 21 Wood (value 11)\n- You have 23 Brick (value 26)\n- You have 17 Ore (value 34)\n\nPlayer 0 has:\n- 10 Wheat (value 6)\n- 20 Wood (value 11)\n- 11 Sheep (value 14) (Adjusted Sheep count for Player 0)\n- 17 Brick (value 26)\n- 23 Ore (value 34)\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, as it's the highest value. Player 0 has 23 Ore.\nYou have 23 Brick, Player 0 has 17. You have more Brick, so maybe you can offer Brick for Ore.\n\nHow about offering some of your abundant Wood, or some Brick, for Ore?\nOr offering Wood for Sheep or Wheat, which Player 0 has more of and you have less of.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nIf you offer 2 Brick (2*26 = 52) for 1 Ore (1*34 = 34), that's not good for you.\nIf you offer 1 Wood and 1 Brick (11+26 = 37) for 1 Ore (34), still not good.\n\nYou have a lot of Wood, but its value is low.\nWhat if you offer Wood for Ore?\nIf you offer 3 Wood (3*11 = 33) for 1 Ore (34), that's a small gain for you. Player 0 might accept this if they need wood.\n\nWhat about trying to get some Wheat or Sheep, as you have less of those?\nYou have 7 Wheat, Player 0 has 10.\nYou have 8 Sheep, Player 0 has 11.\n\nLet's offer something you have in excess, like Wood, to get something more valuable or something you have less of.\n\nLet's try to offer a quantity of Wood for some high-value items:\nOffer: 5 Wood (5*11 = 55 value)\nRequest: 1 Ore (34 value) + 1 Sheep (14 value) = 48 value. Not ideal.\n\nWhat about offering some of your Brick, which you have plenty of, for Ore?\nYou have 23 Brick. Player 0 has 17.\nIf you offer 1 Brick (26) for 1 Ore (34), that's a good trade for you. Player 0 might deny that.\n\nLet's try a balanced offer that still benefits you slightly.\nOffer: 3 Wood (3*11 = 33) for 1 Ore (34). This gives you +1 value. It's a small gain, but acceptable.\n\nConsider the values carefully and make your offer. You want to gain total value.\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
