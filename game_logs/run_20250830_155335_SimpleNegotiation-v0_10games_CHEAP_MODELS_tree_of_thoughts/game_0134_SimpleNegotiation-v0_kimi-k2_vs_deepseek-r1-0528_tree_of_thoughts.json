      "response": "Let me first evaluate Player 1\u2019s newest offer:  \n\n- I give away **3 Sheep** (value = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39)  \n- I receive **1 Ore** (value = 1 \u00d7 36 = 36)  \n\nResult: I lose 3 points. That is clearly worse for me, so I will reject it.  \n[Deny]\n\nNext I decide what I should propose. Looking at the current marginal values of my resources:\n\n- Wheat 5 \u2192 4 remaining if I trade 11\n- Wood   10 \u2192 8 remaining if I trade 1\n- Sheep  13 \u2192 5 remaining if I trade 5\n- Brick  23 \u2192 19 remaining if I trade 2\n- Ore    36 \u2192 31 remaining if I trade 5\n\nI would like more Ore (since its value is highest) and I\u2019m willing to give away lower-value Wheat and Wood. A 9-point gain for me would be:\n\n[Offer: 11 Wheat, 1 Wood \u2192 5 Ore]",
