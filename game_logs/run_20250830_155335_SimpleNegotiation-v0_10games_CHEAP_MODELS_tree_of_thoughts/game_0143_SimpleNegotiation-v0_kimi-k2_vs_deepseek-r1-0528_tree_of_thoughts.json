Analyzing my inventory: I am rich in Ore (22) and fairly rich in Brick (17), while relatively low in Wood (16). Brick is the resource Player 1 seems reluctant to trade away, and Ore is clearly my highest-value resource, so I\u2019m loath to give it away. To find positive (or at least acceptable) value trades that might still tempt Player 1, I look for combinations with Wheat and Sheep and aim to acquire Wood.\n\nSingle best small package I can publicly ask for without over-committing my high-value assets:\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 6 Wood, 2 Brick]",
