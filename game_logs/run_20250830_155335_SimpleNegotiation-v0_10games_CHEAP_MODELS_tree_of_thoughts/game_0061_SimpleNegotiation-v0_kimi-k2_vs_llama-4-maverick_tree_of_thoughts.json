      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first assess the current state of resources after the trades.\n\nInitially, Player 1 had:\n- Wheat: 17 (Value: 6) = 17*6 = 102\n- Wood: 8 (Value: 11) = 8*11 = 88\n- Sheep: 19 (Value: 13) = 19*13 = 247\n- Brick: 8 (Value: 26) = 8*26 = 208\n- Ore: 5 (Value: 36) = 5*36 = 180\n\nTotal initial value = 102 + 88 + 247 + 208 + 180 = 825\n\nAfter the trades:\n1. Accepted: 4 Wheat -> 3 Brick\n   - Wheat: 17 + 4 = 21\n   - Brick: 8 - 3 = 5 (But initially, we had 8 Brick, so now we have 8 + 3 = 11 Brick after getting 3 Brick)\n   Correct: \n   - Wheat: 17 + 4 = 21\n   - Brick: 8 + 3 = 11\n\n2. Accepted: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore\n   - Brick: 11 - 5 = 6\n   - Ore: 5 + 2 = 7\n\n3. Accepted: 3 Wheat -> 6 Sheep\n   - Wheat: 21 + 3 = 24\n   - Sheep: 19 + 6 = 25\n\n4. Accepted: 3 Wheat -> 3 Ore\n   - Wheat: 24 + 3 = 27\n   - Ore: 7 + 3 = 10\n\n5. Made: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick\n   - Sheep: 25 - 5 = 20\n   - Brick: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nLet's calculate the current total value:\n- Wheat: 27 * 6 = 162\n- Wood: 8 * 11 = 88\n- Sheep: 20 * 13 = 260\n- Brick: 8 * 26 = 208\n- Ore: 10 * 36 = 360\n\nTotal current value = 162 + 88 + 260 + 208 + 360 = 1078\n\nThe total value has increased from 825 to 1078.\n\nFor the next turn, let's analyze the resources:\n- We have plenty of Wheat and Ore compared to other players' offers.\n- We have a decent amount of Sheep and Brick.\n\nTo further increase the total value, we should look to trade resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable. Given the last trades, a potential offer could involve Wheat or Sheep, as we have a significant quantity of both.\n\nLet's make an offer: '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' is not a good trade since Ore is more valuable, so let's think of other options.\n\nAnother option is: '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Wood]' is not a good idea because 3 Sheep (3*13=39) and 1 Wheat (6) is more valuable than 2 Wood (2*11=22).\n\nLet's consider: '[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]' \n- 2 Wheat = 2*6 = 12\n- 1 Sheep = 1*13 = 13\n- Total given = 12 + 13 = 25\n- 1 Brick = 1*26 = 26\nIt's a slightly favorable trade.\n\nLet's make a more favorable trade: '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]' \n- 4 Wheat = 4*6 = 24\n- 1 Brick = 1*26 = 26\nThis is a good trade.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Ore -> 3 Wood]' is not a good trade because 3 Wood = 3*11 = 33 is less than 4 Wheat (24) + 1 Ore (36) = 60.\n\nThe best offer seems to be: '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\nMy action: [Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
