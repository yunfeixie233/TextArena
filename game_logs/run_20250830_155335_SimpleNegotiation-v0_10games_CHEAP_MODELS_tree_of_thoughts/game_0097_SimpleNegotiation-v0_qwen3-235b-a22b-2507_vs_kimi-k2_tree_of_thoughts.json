Trade away some of my surplus Ore (it has the highest single-unit value, so exact quantity is important).\n2. Target Sheep (scarcely held, low natural supply) to maximise my gain in total value.\n3. Keep at least ~17-18 Ore so that I still have majority control of the most valuable resource in later turns.\n4. Offer a trim\u2014small, balanced package so Player 0 can visualise gain without fear of a lopsided swap.\n\nPrecision trade table (marginal value check):\n\nI\u2019m about to offer {1 Wheat, 4 Wood, 3 Ore} \u2192 {2 Brick, 5 Sheep}.\n\nCheck offers:\nFor me giving:\n1 Wheat  = 6  \n4 Wood   = 48  \n3 Ore    = 111  \nTotal given value = 165\n\nFor me receiving:\n2 Brick  = 44  \n5 Sheep  = 70  \nTotal received value = 114  \n\nNet value to me = \u201351 \u2013 which isn\u2019t an increase! My bad.\n\nLet me reverse: give Sheep, take Ore.\n\nNo, Ore is my strong card; I want more Sheep, but I cannot let value drop.\n\nRecalc. New approach: exchange low marginal-gain goods (Wheat, excess Wood) into scarce ones (Sheep) without dumping too much Ore.\n\nQuick scan:\nI am already maxed in Brick (have 16, plenty). Aim for Sheep only.\n\nTarget package gain: give up some Wood (cheaper next to Ore) plus tiny Wheat \u2192 bring Sheep from 5 to ~9 or 10.\n\nRecalc sparing combinations:\n\nGive 2 Wheat + 6 Wood \u2192 3 Sheep\nValue given: 12 (2\u00d76) + 72 (6\u00d712) = 84\nValue received: 3\u00d714 = 42. \u201342, bad.\n\nGive 3 Wood + 2 Ore \u2192 4 Sheep\nGiven: 36 + 74 = 110\nReceive: 56 \u2013 nets me \u201354. Also bad.\n\nRealisation: if I keep Ore\u2019s value so high, any substantial dump is painful. Instead, I WILL trade Ore only 1 unit at a maximum.\n\nCut-it-safe envelope:\n\nOffer the absolute minimum Ore: 1 Ore plus low value filler for Sheep.\n\n1 Wheat 2 Wood 1 Ore \u2192 4 Sheep\nValue given: 6 + 24 + 37 = 67\nValue received: 56 \u2013 \u201311, still bad.\n\nScale down request?\n\n1 Wheat 2 Wood 1 Ore \u2192 2 Sheep\nValue received = 28 total, worse. Still \u201339.\n\nThus, to net a *positive* value gain I must be stingy. New tactic: mildly overpay on strict marginal units but gain *two scarce* Sheep safely, knowing Ore is king.\n\nOffer 1 Wood 1 Ore \u2192 3 Sheep\nValue given: 12 + 37 = 49\nValue received: 42 \u2013 net \u20137, tolerable micro-loss in strict units but anticipated positional advantage from taking sheep off market.\n\nIt is best small slice I can float without hurting badly.\n\n[Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep]",
