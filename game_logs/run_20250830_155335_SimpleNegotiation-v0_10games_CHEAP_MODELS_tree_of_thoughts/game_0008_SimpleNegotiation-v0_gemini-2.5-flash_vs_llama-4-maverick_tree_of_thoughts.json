However, let's consider my current resources and the potential gain or loss.\n\nI currently have:\n- Sheep: 22\n- Brick: 6\n\nIf I accept, I will have:\n- Sheep: 22 + 5 = 27\n- Brick: 6 - 2 = 4\n\nLet's calculate the total value change:\n- Gaining 5 Sheep: +70\n- Losing 2 Brick: -48\n- Net change: +70 - 48 = +22\n\nAlthough the immediate value seems not in my favor due to the direct exchange value, having more Sheep could be beneficial if I can trade them for something of higher value later.\n\nHowever, the direct calculation indicates a loss in immediate value. Let's think about a potential counteroffer that could be more favorable.\n\nBefore deciding, let's examine my resources again:\n+ [Wheat] Qty:17 Value:5\n+ [Wood] Qty:16 Value:8\n+ [Sheep] Qty:22 Value:14\n+ [Brick] Qty:6 Value:24\n+ [Ore] Qty:6 Value:36\n\nI need to make a decision or a counteroffer.\n\nSince the offer is not very favorable, I'll consider making a counteroffer.\n\nLet's think about what I can offer that might be more appealing to Player0 and still be somewhat beneficial or less costly for me.\n\nOne strategy is to offer resources of lower value to me in exchange for Brick, as it seems they are looking for Brick.\n\nLet's directly respond with a counteroffer instead of accepting or denying the current offer.\n\n'[Offer:4 Wheat,1 Wood ->2 Brick]' is a potential counteroffer, offering resources of relatively lower value to me.\n\nThe calculation for this counteroffer is:\n- 4 Wheat = 4 * 5 = 20\n- 1 Wood = 1 * 8 = 8\n- Total offered = 20 + 8 = 28\n- 2 Brick = 2 * 24 = 48\n\nThis counteroffer gives me 2 Brick for resources worth 28, which is still a relatively bad deal but better than losing Sheep directly.\n\nHowever, let's adjust the counteroffer to be more reasonable.\n\n'[Offer:3 Wheat ->1 Brick]' is a simpler and less costly counteroffer.\n\nLet's check the values:\n- 3 Wheat = 3 * 5 = 15\n- 1 Brick = 1 * 24 = 24\n\nThis is a more acceptable ratio.\n\nMy response will be: '[Offer:3 Wheat ->1 Brick]'",

Rejected.\n- I offered 4 Wheat, 1 Wood for 2 Brick. Rejected.\n- I offered 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat for 1 Ore. Rejected.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the resources and potential trades\nGiven the resources and their values, we should look for trades that increase the total value.\n- High-value resources are Ore (36) and Brick (24).\n- Sheep (14) is relatively valuable compared to Wheat (5) and Wood (8).\n\n## Step 5: Consider potential trades\nTo increase the total value, we should consider offering resources with lower values for those with higher values.\n- Offering Wheat or Wood for Brick or Ore could be beneficial due to the significant difference in value.\n\n## Step 6: Formulate a new trade offer\nLet's consider offering some Wood (Value: 8) for Ore (Value: 36), as Ore is highly valued.\n- Offering 4 Wood (4*8 = 32) for 1 Ore (1*36 = 36) could be a good trade since 32 < 36.\n\n## Step 7: Create the trade offer in the required format\nFor 4 Wood, I request 1 Ore.
