This means Player 1 values Ore and Brick more. You improved your total value from this trade.\nYou have a good amount of Ore and Brick now. You have less Wood and Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get more Wheat. It's a low-value resource but can be useful for another player.\nI will offer some of my higher-value resources for Wheat or Wood, which I have less of.\nPlayer 1 seemed to value Ore and Brick. I have a lot of Ore at 27 and Brick at 11. I should try to trade some of these for Wheat or Wood.\n\nOffer: 1 Brick -> 2 Wheat, 1 Wood (27 vs 2*6 + 1*10 = 22, so I lose 5, but I gain diversity) - Maybe not a good trade in terms of pure value, but aiming for diversity.\n\nLet's try creating a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing to player 1's preferences.\nI still have a good amount of Ore. Let's offer a small amount of Ore/Brick for Wood or Wheat.\n\nProposed offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Wood, 1 Wheat (37 vs 2*10+1*6 = 26). This is a net value loss for me. Not a good idea.\n\nHow about: 1 Brick -> 3 Wood (27 vs 3*10 = 30). This is good for me. Player 1 values Brick.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wood]",
