      "response": "### Negotiation Game Strategy for Player 0\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: Qty: 7, Value: 5\n- Wood: Qty: 5, Value: 8\n- Sheep: Qty: 17, Value: 18\n- Brick: Qty: 25, Value: 28\n- Ore: Qty: 22, Value: 34\n\n#### Initial Total Value:\nTo calculate the initial total value, we multiply the quantity of each resource by its value and sum these products.\n- Total Value = (7*5) + (5*8) + (17*18) + (25*28) + (22*34)\n- Total Value = 35 + 40 + 306 + 700 + 748 = 1829\n\n#### Strategy:\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources through trades. To do this effectively, we need to identify which resources are potentially undervalued or overvalued relative to others and make trades accordingly.\n\n1. **Identify Potential Trades:**\n   - First, let's assess the value of our resources relative to each other and consider what would be a beneficial trade.\n   - We have a high quantity and value of Brick and Ore. Sheep is also relatively valuable.\n   - Wheat and Wood have lower values compared to others.\n\n2. **Potential Trade Offers:**\n   - Consider offering Wheat or Wood (lower value resources) in exchange for resources that could potentially increase our total value.\n   - Since Sheep, Brick, and Ore are of higher value, we should look to retain or acquire more of these if possible.\n\n3. **Initial Trade Offer:**\n   - Let's offer some Wheat (the lowest value resource) in exchange for something else. For example, offering 5 Wheat for 1 Sheep could be a starting point because Sheep is more valuable.\n   - However, we need to be realistic about what the opponent might accept. A more balanced trade in terms of quantity and value might be more appealing.\n\n#### First Turn Action:\nLet's make an initial trade offer. We can offer 5 Wheat (total value of 25) for 1 Wood (total value of 8) more than we currently have, but this seems not beneficial. Instead, let's directly propose a trade that seems reasonable:\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]' is a possible offer because it directly tries to increase our total value by trading a lower-value resource for a higher-value one. The calculation is as follows:\n- Offering 5 Wheat = 5 * 5 = 25\n- Requesting 1 Sheep = 1 * 18 = 18\nThis is not a good trade for us. Let's think of a better one.\n\n#### Alternative Offer for Turn 1:\n'[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n- Offering 2 Wood + 2 Wheat = (2*8) + (2*5) = 16 + 10 = 26\n- Requesting 1 Ore = 1 * 34 = 34\nThis trade seems beneficial as we are getting a resource worth 34 in exchange for resources worth 26.\n\n#### Action for Turn 1:\n'[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' \n\nLet's execute this trade offer in the first turn and see the response from the opponent.",

Trading it could be a good start.\n   - **[Wood]** is relatively less valuable compared to others but more than Wheat.\n\n3. **Propose a Trade**:\n   - Since **[Wheat]** is of the lowest value and we have a small quantity, let's consider trading it.\n   - Let's offer the remaining Wheat (4 units) for something more valuable. A potential trade could be: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`.\n   - Brick is chosen as it's more valuable than Wheat and we already have a significant quantity of it, but getting more could still be beneficial.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis is a calculated risk to potentially increase our total value by trading low-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe goal is to increase the total value. By trading 4 Wheat (total value 20) for 1 Brick (value 28), we effectively gain 8 in value, assuming the trade is accepted.

Current Qty: 26 (from the previous trade where I got 1 Brick for 4 Wheat, not 5 as my previous offer inaccurately suggested; the correct previous trade was 3 Wheat for 1 Sheep and then 4 Wheat for 1 Brick).\n4. **Ore**: Initially 22, offered 2. Current Qty: 20.\n5. **Wood**: Initially 5, no change. Current Qty: 5.\n\nLet's recount accurately based on the history:\n- Initially: Wheat=7, Wood=5, Sheep=17, Brick=25, Ore=22.\n- After the first rejected offer (5 Wheat for 1 Sheep): No change.\n- After the second rejected offer (2 Ore for 1 Wood): No change.\n- After the third trade (3 Wheat for 1 Sheep): Wheat=4, Sheep=18.\n- After the fourth trade (4 Wheat for 1 Brick): Wheat=0, Brick=26.\n\nCorrected Current Resources:\n- Wheat: 0\n- Wood: 5\n- Sheep: 18\n- Brick: 26\n- Ore: 20\n\n### Values of Current Resources\n\n1. **[Wheat]**: Qty: 0, Value: 5. Total Value = 0.\n2. **[Wood]**: Qty: 5, Value: 8. Total Value = 5 * 8 = 40.\n3. **[Sheep]**: Qty: 18, Value: 18. Total Value = 18 * 18 = 324.\n4. **[Brick]**: Qty: 26, Value: 28. Total Value = 26 * 28 = 728.\n5. **[Ore]**: Qty: 20, Value: 34. Total Value = 20 * 34 = 680.\n\n### Total Value\n\nTotal Value = 0 + 40 + 324 + 728 + 680 = 1772.\n\n### Next Action\n\nSince Player 1 accepted my last offer and made no new offer, and given that I have used up all my Wheat, I need to evaluate the current state and think about the next possible beneficial trade.\n\nGiven my resources and their values, I should look for opportunities to trade resources that are less valuable to me for those that are more valuable. Since I have no Wheat, I need to look at other resources.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n\n1. **Trading Ore for Wood**: Ore is valuable, but Wood is also relatively valuable to me now since I have a good amount of other resources. However, trading 2 Ore (Value = 68) for 1 Wood (Value = 8) is not beneficial.\n   \nLet's formulate a more reasonable offer:\n\nI have an abundance of Brick and Sheep relative to their initial quantities and values. I can consider trading some Sheep or Brick if I can get a good deal.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nConsidering the values:\n- **[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 3 Wood, 1 Ore]**: This involves giving up (2*18 + 1*28) = 36 + 28 = 64 in value for (3*8 + 1*34) = 24 + 34 = 58 in value. This is not beneficial.\n\nLet's think of a more reasonable trade:\n- **[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Wood]**: This involves giving up (1*18) = 18 in value for (1*8) = 8 in value. Still not beneficial.\n\nLet's try again:\n- **[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]**: This involves giving up (2*28) = 56 in value for (1*34) = 34 in value. Not beneficial.\n\nLet's think about the most beneficial trade given the current resources:\n- **[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Wood]**: This involves giving up (1*34) = 34 in value for (2*8) = 16 in value. Not beneficial.\n\nUpon reevaluation, a potentially good trade could be:\n- **[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**: This involves giving up (2*18) = 36 in value for (1*34) = 34 in value. Still slightly not beneficial.\n\nLet's directly propose a trade that could be reasonable and see how Player 1 responds.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n\nLet's offer something that might be considered reasonable given the constraints:\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood]\n\nThis trade involves giving up (1*28 + 1*18) = 46 in value for (1*34 + 1*8) = 42 in value. Still slightly not beneficial but let's try.\n\nLet's send: [Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore].\n\nTo follow the format as requested:\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

I offered 3 Wheat for 1 Sheep (initially offered 5 Wheat, but I adjust to 3 Wheat after first rejection), and it was accepted. So, I have:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 7 - 3 = 4\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 17 + 1 = 18\n\n2. I offered 4 Wheat for 1 Brick, and it was accepted. So, I have:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 4 - 4 = 0\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 25 + 1 = 26\n\n3. I offered 2 Sheep and 1 Brick for 3 Wood and 1 Ore, and it was accepted. So, I have:\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 18 - 2 = 16\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 26 - 1 = 25\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 5 + 3 = 8\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 22 - 1 = 21\n\nCurrent resources:\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 8    Value: 8\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 16   Value: 18\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 25   Value: 28\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 21   Value: 34\n\nSince I've run out of Wheat, I need to look at other resources to make a trade. Let's evaluate the current resources and think about the next trade.\n\nTo maximize the total value, I should look for trades that increase the overall value. One way to do this is to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values if possible.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n- Trading [Wood] (Value: 8) for other resources could be beneficial if I can get something more valuable.\n- [Sheep] (Value: 18), [Brick] (Value: 28), and [Ore] (Value: 34) are relatively valuable. \n\nConsidering the values, a potential trade could involve offering some [Sheep] or [Brick] for something more valuable or equally valuable but in a different category to diversify.\n\nHowever, since Player 1 has not made any new offers, I'll have to make a new offer. Let's think about a reasonable trade.\n\nOne potential trade is to offer some [Brick] for [Ore] since both are valuable, but [Ore] is more valuable per unit. However, I need to be cautious not to deplete my resources too much.\n\nLet's make an offer:\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer aims to get more [Ore] in exchange for [Brick], both of which are relatively valuable.\n\nResponse: [Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
