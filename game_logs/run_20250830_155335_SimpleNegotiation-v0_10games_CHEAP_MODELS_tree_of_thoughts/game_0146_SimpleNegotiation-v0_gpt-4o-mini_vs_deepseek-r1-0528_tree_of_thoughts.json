Since Player 1 seems to value Brick, I could propose an offer that leverages my Wood, which I have in excess.\n\n**Trade Offer Proposal:**\nI will offer:\n- 5 Wood (I have 13, so I can afford to lose 5)\n- In exchange, I will request:\n- 3 Brick\n- 2 Ore\n\nThis will help me get more valuable Brick and Ore while utilizing my excess Wood.\n\n**Proposed Offer:**\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 3 Brick, 2 Ore] \n\nLet\u2019s see how Player 1 responds to this offer!",
