Since P1 mirrored my 3-for-5 (3 Brick for 5 Wheat + 4 Wood) twice, they may undervalue Brick\u2014but I still value it highly.\n\n### Strategy for Next Offer\nSince P1 has shown no interest in gaining Brick but has not offered any non-symmetric trades, I\u2019ll test if P1 values **Ore over Brick** by offering them **Ore** instead. This tests flexibility:  \n- My Ore value per unit (40) > Brick (23). Trading Ore risks a net loss (unless I get disproportionately in return), but I can spare a small amount (having 25).  \n- Target: Acquire Brick (scarcity = 8) while gauging P1\u2019s willingness to part with it for Ore.\n\n### [Offer: 2 Ore, 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick]",
