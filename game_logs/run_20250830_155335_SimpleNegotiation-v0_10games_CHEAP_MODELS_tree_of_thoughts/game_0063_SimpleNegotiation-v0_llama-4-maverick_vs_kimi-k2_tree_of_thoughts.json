      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the Game and Current Resources\nThe Negotiation Game is about trading resources to increase the total value of the resources you hold. I start with: Wheat (Qty: 23, Value: 6), Wood (Qty: 19, Value: 9), Sheep (Qty: 15, Value: 17), Brick (Qty: 20, Value: 22), and Ore (Qty: 22, Value: 37).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the Total Initial Value of Resources\nTo understand the starting point, calculate the total value: (23*6) + (19*9) + (15*17) + (20*22) + (22*37) = 138 + 171 + 255 + 440 + 814 = 1818.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the Resources and Their Values\nThe resources and their values are: Wheat (6), Wood (9), Sheep (17), Brick (22), and Ore (37). Ore is the most valuable, and Wheat is the least.\n\n## Step 4: Decide on the Initial Strategy\nSince Ore is the most valuable resource and I have a significant quantity of it (22), I should consider trading some of it for other resources that could potentially increase the total value or at least maintain it if the trade is fair. However, I need to be cautious not to trade away too much value.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate the First Trade Offer\nTo start, I need to identify resources that I can afford to give away and those that I might gain from. Given that Ore is very valuable, I should try to trade it for something of comparable or higher total value. One potential trade could involve offering Ore for Brick or other high-value resources.\n\n## Step 6: Consider Potential Trades\nLet's consider trading some Ore for Brick since both are high-value resources. I have 22 Ore and 20 Brick. A potential trade could be: [Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick] because 2 Ore = 74 and 3 Brick = 66, this isn't a good trade. Let's adjust: [Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick] since 1 Ore = 37, 1 Wheat = 6, total = 43, and 2 Brick = 44, this is a slightly better deal.\n\n## Step 7: Propose the First Trade\nLet's start with: [Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]. This trade gives away 43 units of value (37 for Ore + 6 for Wheat) and receives 44 units of value (2 Brick), which is a slight gain.\n\n## Step 8: Execute the First Turn\nI will propose: [Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick].\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",

Let's evaluate its effectiveness:\n- Value of 2 Ore = 2 * 37 = 74\n- Value of 4 Brick = 4 * 22 = 88\nSince 88 > 74, the trade was beneficial.\n\n### Planning the Next Move\n\nTo maximize the total value of my resources, I need to consider the current distribution and the potential trades. The goal is to acquire resources that are of higher value or to get more quantity of a resource that is valuable.\n\n### Formulating a Trade Offer\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n1. **Giving away lower-value resources to get higher-value ones**: I could offer some Wheat (Value: 6) or Wood (Value: 9) to get more valuable resources.\n   \n2. **Optimizing the current portfolio**: Since Ore (Value: 37) is one of the most valuable resources, I should consider not giving it away unless absolutely necessary for a very beneficial trade. Brick (Value: 22) is also valuable, and I have just increased my quantity of it.\n\nLet's consider a trade that involves giving away some of the less valuable resources (Wheat or Wood) to get more of the valuable resources (Ore, Brick, or Sheep).\n\n### Proposed Trade\n\nOne potential trade could be:\n- Offering 5 Wheat (Value: 6) and 2 Wood (Value: 9) to get 1 Ore (Value: 37).\n- Value given away = (5*6) + (2*9) = 30 + 18 = 48\n- Value received = 1 * 37 = 37\nThis trade is not beneficial as it results in a net loss.\n\nLet's consider another trade:\n- Offering 2 Wheat (Value: 6) to get 1 Sheep (Value: 17).\n- Value given away = 2 * 6 = 12\n- Value received = 1 * 17 = 17\nThis trade is beneficial as it results in a net gain of 5.\n\n### Trade Offer to Player 1\n\nLet's make a trade offer to Player 1:\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'\n\nThe action for this turn is:\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'",

For instance, offering Wheat or Wood for Sheep or Brick could be a possibility if the rate is favorable.\n\nSince Player 1 accepted our last two offers, we might consider making another offer. Let's propose a trade that could be attractive:\n\nOffering 2 Wood (Value: 2*9 = 18) for 1 Sheep (Value: 17) might not be favorable since we're potentially losing value.

The total value of the resources can be calculated as (23*6) + (19*9) + (15*17) + (20*22) + (22*37).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the initial total value of resources\nInitial total value = (23*6) + (19*9) + (15*17) + (20*22) + (22*37) = 138 + 171 + 255 + 440 + 814 = 1818.\n\n## Step 3: Review the transactions made so far\n1. Offered 2 Ore for 4 Brick and it was accepted. So, Ore decreased by 2 and Brick increased by 4.\n2. Offered 2 Wheat for 1 Sheep and it was accepted. So, Wheat decreased by 2 and Sheep increased by 1.\n3. Offered 3 Wheat for 1 Brick and it was rejected.\n\n## Step 4: Update the resources based on the transactions\nAfter the transactions:\n- Wheat: 23 - 2 - 3 = 18\n- Wood: 19 (no change)\n- Sheep: 15 + 1 = 16\n- Brick: 20 + 4 = 24 (after the first accepted trade)\n- Ore: 22 - 2 = 20\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the current total value of resources after the transactions\nCurrent total value = (18*6) + (19*9) + (16*17) + (24*22) + (20*37) = 108 + 171 + 272 + 528 + 740 = 1819.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the last transaction and the current state\nThe last offer (3 Wheat for 1 Brick) was rejected. The value of 3 Wheat is 3*6 = 18, and the value of 1 Brick is 1*22 = 22. The offer was beneficial, but it was rejected.\n\n## Step 7: Consider potential trades for the next turn\nTo increase the total value, we should look for trades where the value of what we receive is greater than the value of what we give. Possible trades could involve offering resources with lower values for resources with higher values.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate resources for potential trades\nWe have Wheat (Value: 6), Wood (Value: 9), Sheep (Value: 17), Brick (Value: 22), and Ore (Value: 37). We should consider offering Wheat or Wood for Sheep, Brick, or Ore, or offering Sheep for Brick or Ore.\n\n## Step 9: Identify a potential trade\nOne potential trade could be offering Wheat for Sheep since Sheep is more valuable. We could offer 3 Wheat (Value: 18) for 1 Sheep (Value: 17), which is not beneficial. However, offering 2 Wheat (Value: 12) for 1 Sheep (Value: 17) is beneficial.\n\n## Step 10: Formulate a trade offer\nLet's offer 2 Wheat for 1 Sheep.\n\n## Step 11: Express the trade offer in the required format\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]}$",
