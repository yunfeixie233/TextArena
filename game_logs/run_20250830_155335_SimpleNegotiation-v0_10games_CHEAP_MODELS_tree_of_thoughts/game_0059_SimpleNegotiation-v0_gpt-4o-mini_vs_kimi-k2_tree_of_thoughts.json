Wood is the next strongest (10), and Sheep & Brick prices are decent.  I have only 12 Wood, 22 Sheep, 14 Brick, and 14 Wheat.  I definitely do NOT want to give away more Wheat unless it\u2019s part of a big gain.  My Brick stock became smaller after the last round, so I\u2019d like to avoid moving more Brick out unless a big pay-back.\n\nRelative rarity check (inferred from implicit pricing)  \nOre is the only resource valued at 35, i.e. scarcest.  \nBrick at 22 is \u201cmiddle\u201d, Sheep (15), Wood (10), Wheat (6) cheap.  \n\nHence I want to move the cheaper stuff (especially Wheat/Wood) and harvest more Ore/Brick.\n\nCurrent offer from P0 at turn 5  \nOffered: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat \u2192 5 Ore  \n\nValues I would receive: 5 Ore = 5 \u00d7 35 = 175  \nValues I would give: 4 Wood = 40 and 2 Wheat = 12 \u2192 52 total.  \nNet value change = 175 \u2212 52 = +123.  That\u2019s positive for me.  I also keep plentiful quantities of both Wood and Wheat to complete future deals.  No individual resource would drop below a comfortable level.\n\nSo it\u2019s worth taking.\n\n[Accept]",
