      "response": "In the previous turn, Player 0 offered 5 Wheat and 3 Wood for 2 of my Ore, but I rejected that because it would have reduced my total resource value (trading away 37-value Ore for lower-value resources). I then countered by offering 1 Ore for 8 Wheat and 4 Wood, which would have increased my value if accepted, but Player 0 rejected it. Since Player 0 made no new offer, I'll propose another trade that benefits me.\n\nAfter reviewing my resources, Ore is my highest-value asset (37 per unit), but I have a surplus (19 units). I also have moderate amounts of Wheat and Wood, which are lower-value (6 and 11 per unit). Trading away Ore for a bundle of Wheat and Wood can boost my total value if the exchange provides enough value gain. My last offer was declined, so I'm adjusting by asking for slightly less: 7 Wheat and 3 Wood in exchange for 1 Ore.\n\nHere's the value calculation from my perspective:\n- **Giving up**: 1 Ore (37 value).\n- **Receiving**: 7 Wheat (7 \u00d7 6 = 42 value) and 3 Wood (3 \u00d7 11 = 33 value), totaling 75 value in return.\n- **Net gain**: 75 received - 37 given = +38 value.\n\nThis trade would increase my total resource value significantly while being a more reasonable ask for Player 0.
