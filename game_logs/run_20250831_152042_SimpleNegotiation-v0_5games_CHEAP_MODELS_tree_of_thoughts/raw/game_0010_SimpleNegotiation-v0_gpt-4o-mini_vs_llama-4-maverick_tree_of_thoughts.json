      "response": "For this trading scenario, let's bring in three different trading experts to provide their perspectives: a Resource Maximizer, a Market Analyst, and a Risk Assessor. \n\n### Expert 1: Resource Maximizer\n*Step 1: Analyze Current Resources*\nThe total values of Player 0\u2019s resources are:\n- Wheat: (8 * 6) = 48\n- Wood: (8 * 11) = 88\n- Sheep: (16 * 12) = 192\n- Brick: (21 * 27) = 567\n- Ore: (8 * 39) = 312 \n\nTotal value = 48 + 88 + 192 + 567 + 312 = 1207.\n\nLooking at the overall value, Ore is the highest valued resource per unit, followed by Brick. We should aim to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n### Expert 2: Market Analyst\n*Step 1: Analyze the Trade Market*\nConsidering common trading patterns, Brick and Ore tend to be traded at higher rates due to their necessity in various building projects. There may also be players who need Sheep or Wood for easier access to their needed resources. I think offering Sheep and Ore for Brick could be appealing, as I expect high demand for Brick from opponents.\n\n### Expert 3: Risk Assessor\n*Step 1: Evaluate Risks*\nTrading always comes with some risk. My focus will be on potential losses versus gains. If Player 0 trades away Ore, they might face a shortage in future turns. I propose to keep a steady reserve of Ore and find alternatives to trade instead, maybe focusing on Wheat or Wood instead, since they have lower values.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n**Expert 1 (Resource Maximizer):**\nI think we should offer a trade that increases our Brick supply while giving away lower value resources. \n*Proposed Offer:* [Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]\n\n**Expert 2 (Market Analyst):**\nThis offer makes sense as it expands Brick supplies. I support it as Brick can be extremely valuable for the next trading rounds.\n\n**Expert 3 (Risk Assessor):**\nWhile I understand the appeal, offering Ore could end up being detrimental in the upcoming trades. I suggest we reconsider our resources before making the offer. Still, I\u2019ll back this offer because we do need more Brick.\n\n---\n\n**Final Offer:**\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]\n\n### Next Steps in the Game:\nWe're ready to submit the offer and will wait for responses from other players. If accepted, we enhance our Brick resources; if denied, we'll reevaluate based on feedback.",

      "response": "As Player 0, it's crucial to strategize further in the Negotiation Game for maximizing the total value of resources. Let's consider three different expert perspectives to guide our next steps:\n\n**Expert 1: Resource Management Specialist**\n1. Evaluate the current resources' total values post-trade:\n   - Wheat: 8 * 6 = 48\n   - Wood: 8 * 11 = 88\n   - Sheep: (16 - 3 + 2) * 12 = 15 * 12 = 180\n   - Brick: (21 + 5) * 27 = 26 * 27 = 702\n   - Ore: (8 - 2) * 39 = 6 * 39 = 234 \n   - Total value after the trade = 48 + 88 + 180 + 702 + 234 = 1252.\n\n2. Assess remaining resources and evaluate if further trades would provide an opportunity to enhance value. Consider offers that can exchange surplus resources (like Wheat or Wood) for potentially higher value resources (like Ore or Brick).\n\n**Expert 2: Market Analyst**\n1. Look at resource values and understand their market dynamics. Currently, Brick has a high value per unit, which was the reason for the earlier trade.\n2. Propose offering more Wood (8 qty, high total value) for Ore (currently valued at a high level). Initiate by offering:\n   - '[Offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Ore]'.\n\n3. This leverages the surplus of Wood, which we have in excess, turning it into a high-value resource.\n\n**Expert 3: Aggressive Negotiator**\n1. To maximize profit through negotiation, consider the most aggressive offers that can potentially corner the market on high-value items.\n2. Suggest making a bold offer to other players asking them to provide both Wheat and Sheep in exchange for the surplus of Brick and Wood. \n   - Example: '[Offer: 5 Brick, 5 Wood -> 6 Sheep, 4 Wheat]'.\n\n3. This would encourage lower-valued resources in return for higher total value, enabling strategic dominance over the remaining player resources.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. After making an aggressive trade offer, the experts will reevaluate based on the responses received and keep refining until either a live trade negotiates or the offers are denied.\n2. Continue trading and evaluating after each turn to ensure the best possible outcome. Each expert will remain until the team achieves maximum efficiency in trades. \n\nFeel free to assess these offers and decide if you'd like to make any additional moves!",

The offered 4 Wood have a total value of 4*9 = 36. The requested 2 Ore have a total value of 2*37 = 74. The trade is not in our favor as we're losing 74 - 36 = 38 value.\n\n2. **Resource Manager**: We need to assess if we have surplus resources that can be utilized effectively. We currently have 20 units of Ore and 23 units of Wood. Giving away 2 Ore will reduce our Ore quantity to 18. We need to consider if we can spare 2 Ore.\n\n3. **Strategic Trader**: The offer indicates Player 0 is looking for Ore, which might be scarce for them. We should consider if we can use this information to negotiate a better deal or if we should accept this offer to potentially build a future trading relationship.\n\n### Decision for Turn 1\n\nGiven the analysis, the Value Analyst suggests that the trade is not favorable due to the significant value difference. The Resource Manager indicates we have a considerable amount of Ore but giving away 2 Ore reduces our stock. The Strategic Trader suggests considering the long-term implications.\n\nSince the trade is not in our favor value-wise and we have a substantial amount of Ore, we might not want to accept this offer without a compelling reason to do so.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\n[Deny]\n\nThis is the default action unless we decide to [Accept] or make a new [Offer].\n\nLet's proceed to see if we can formulate a new offer or if there's another development.\n\nCurrent State after Player 0's last offer:\n- Wheat: 12 units\n- Wood: 23 units\n- Sheep: 11 units\n- Brick: 19 units\n- Ore: 20 units\n\nTo make a new offer, we need to identify resources we can spare and resources we need. Let's consider that.\n\n### New Offer Consideration\n\n1. **Value Analyst**: Suggests looking for trades that increase our total value. We could offer resources with lower values and request resources with higher values.\n\n2. **Resource Manager**: Identifies that we have a good amount of Wood and Wheat, which are relatively low in value. We could consider offering some of these.\n\n3. **Strategic Trader**: Notes that since Player 0 is looking for Ore, we might be able to negotiate a trade involving Ore for something of higher value or a combination that benefits us.\n\nLet's consider making an offer:\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]\n\nThis offer gives away resources of relatively lower value (4*5 + 1*9 = 20 + 9 = 29) and requests resources of higher value (2*37 + 1*30 = 74 + 30 = 104), which is still not favorable. We need to adjust our strategy.\n\nLet's directly analyze and propose:\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis trade involves giving away 3 Wood (value = 3*9 = 27) for 1 Ore (value = 37). It's a gain of 10 value.\n\n### Turn 1 New Offer\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nLet's wait for the response.",

(Done above, not beneficial)\n   - Step 3: Suggest an alternative trade that could increase the total value.\n\n2. **Resource Strategist**: Thinks about the strategic importance and balance of resources.\n   - Step 1: Analyze the current distribution of resources and their quantities.\n   - Step 2: Consider how the latest offer affects the resource balance.\n   - Step 3: Identify potential trades that improve resource balance or utility.\n\n3. **Market Predictor**: Tries to predict future market trends and adjust trades accordingly.\n   - Step 1: Analyze past trades and their impacts.\n   - Step 2: Predict potential future trades or market shifts.\n   - Step 3: Suggest trades that would be beneficial based on predicted future market conditions.\n\nGiven the latest offer from Player 0, let's see the experts' thoughts:\n\n1. **Value Analyst**: The offer decreases our total value, so we should deny it. Let's look for a counteroffer that increases our value.\n\n2. **Resource Strategist**: Accepting the offer increases Sheep but decreases Brick and Ore. We need to assess if having more Sheep is strategically beneficial. However, the decrease in Ore and Brick might not be ideal.\n\n3. **Market Predictor**: If we predict that Player 0 is likely to offer something valuable in the future because they need Sheep, we might consider accepting the offer to build a stronger relationship or to fulfill a potential future need. However, based on the value, it's not directly beneficial.\n\nGiven the decrease in total value, the most straightforward decision based on the **Value Analyst** is to deny the offer.\n\nAction: `[Deny]`\n\nLet's formulate a new offer. Considering we have a good amount of Wheat and Wood, and relatively lower value resources compared to Ore and Brick, we should try to trade Wheat or Wood for higher-value resources if possible.\n\nNew Offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]`\n\nLet's send this offer to Player 0 and see their response. \n\nAction: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]`",

      "response": "To analyze the current trading situation in the Negotiation Game, I will take on the perspectives of three different experts: \n\n1. **Market Analyst**: This expert will analyze the resources in terms of their market value and offers strategies for maximizing utility. \n2. **Resource Strategist**: This expert will focus on resource management, considering the long-term implications of trades and scarcity of resources.\n3. **Negotiation Tactician**: This expert will evaluate negotiation strategies and the psychology behind trade offers and counteroffers.\n\n### Expert 1: Market Analyst\n**Analysis Step 1**: \nIn this turn, I observe the values of the resources exchanged:\n- Sheep: 12 each (3 Sheep = 36 value)\n- Ore: 39 each (2 Ore = 78 value)\n- Brick: 27 each (5 Brick = 135 value)\n\nThe initial offer provided substantial value for Wheat and Wood. As for the latest offer from Player 1 (5 Wheat, 2 Wood for 1 Ore and 1 Brick), the combined value of 5 Wheat (30) and 2 Wood (22) offers a total value of 52, which is less than the worth of 1 Ore (39) and 1 Brick (27). Thus, I would recommend denying Player 1\u2019s latest offer as it's not favorable. \n\n### Expert 2: Resource Strategist\n**Analysis Step 1**: \nFocusing on resource management, I consider the current inventory of Player 0 post-trades. Here\u2019s a snapshot:\n- Wheat: 5 (down from 8)\n- Wood: 4 (down from 8)\n- Sheep: 13 (down from 16 due to offers)\n- Brick: 10 (increased from trading)\n- Ore: 6 (also decreased)\n\nLooking at Player 1's recent offer, while maximizing the quantity of Ore may seem appealing, the total resource devaluation (trading away more valuable resources: Wheat and Wood) is against long-term resource utility. I recommend denying this offer as Player 0 will still need Wheat and Wood for other strategic trades.\n\n### Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician\n**Analysis Step 1**: \nAnalyzing the psychology of the current offers:\n- Player 1\u2019s trades seem to target Player 0's weaker resources (Wheat and Wood), indicating an understanding of their value in the market. However, it also shows they may be undervaluing the strategic importance of Ore and Brick, which are more valuable assets for Player 0.\n\nI would suggest Player 0 revisit the relationship dynamics and reinforce the value of Tree other than simply resource quantities. If Player 1 continues to undervalue resources, Player 0 should consider making a counteroffer that emphasizes Player 0's valuable resources or explore other players to trade with. \n\n---\n\n**Decision Making**: \nTo summarize recommendations:\n- **Deny Player 1's latest offer** as it does not provide an advantageous trade.\n- **Seek other trades with possibly better offers** or consider a different negotiation strategy with Player 1.\n\nNext steps will involve evaluating other potential trades or finding better negotiating positions.",

      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the initial situation and the task\nThe task is to increase the total value of resources through trading. Initially, Player 1 has: Wheat (12, Value: 5), Wood (23, Value: 9), Sheep (12, Value: 15), Brick (14, Value: 30), Ore (22, Value: 37).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the initial total value of resources\nTo assess if trades are beneficial, we first calculate the total initial value.\n- Wheat: 12 * 5 = 60\n- Wood: 23 * 9 = 207\n- Sheep: 12 * 15 = 180\n- Brick: 14 * 30 = 420\n- Ore: 22 * 37 = 814\nTotal initial value = 60 + 207 + 180 + 420 + 814 = 1681\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the trades made so far\n1. Player 0 offered: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep. Player 1 accepted.\n- Gained: 5 Brick (5*30 = 150), 2 Sheep (2*15 = 30)\n- Lost: 3 Sheep (3*15 = 45), 2 Ore (2*37 = 74)\n- Net gain: 150 + 30 - 45 - 74 = 61\n2. Player 0 offered: 4 Wood -> 2 Ore. Player 1 accepted.\n- Gained: 4 Wood (4*9 = 36), 2 Ore (2*37 = 74)\n- Lost: 0 (since it's a gain)\n- However, the correct interpretation is: Gained 4 Wood (4*9 = 36), Lost 2 Ore (2*37 = 74)\n- Net gain: 36 - 74 = -38\n3. Player 1 offered: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick. Player 0 accepted.\n- Gained: 2 Ore (2*37 = 74), 1 Brick (1*30 = 30)\n- Lost: 4 Wheat (4*5 = 20), 1 Wood (1*9 = 9)\n- Net gain: 74 + 30 - 20 - 9 = 75\n4. Player 0 offered: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore. Player 1 rejected.\n5. Player 1 offered: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick. Player 0 rejected.\n6. Player 0 offered nothing new.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the current resources and their total value after the trades\nAfter the trades:\n- Accepted trade 1: Lost 3 Sheep, 2 Ore; Gained 5 Brick, 2 Sheep (net: Sheep = 12 - 3 + 2 = 11, Ore = 22 - 2 = 20, Brick = 14 + 5 = 19)\n- Accepted trade 2: Gained 4 Wood; Lost 2 Ore (net: Wood = 23 + 4 = 27, Ore = 20 - 2 = 18)\n- Accepted trade 3: Lost 4 Wheat, 1 Wood; Gained 2 Ore, 1 Brick (net: Wheat = 12 - 4 = 8, Wood = 27 - 1 = 26, Ore = 18 + 2 = 20, Brick = 19 + 1 = 20)\nSo, the final quantities are: Wheat (8), Wood (26), Sheep (11), Brick (20), Ore (20).\n- Wheat: 8 * 5 = 40\n- Wood: 26 * 9 = 234\n- Sheep: 11 * 15 = 165\n- Brick: 20 * 30 = 600\n- Ore: 20 * 37 = 740\nTotal current value = 40 + 234 + 165 + 600 + 740 = 1779\n\n## Step 5: Consider the advice of different trading experts\nLet's have three experts analyze the situation:\n1. **Value Maximizer**: Focuses on maximizing the total value of resources.\n2. **Resource Balancer**: Ensures a balanced distribution of resources for future flexibility.\n3. **Risk Manager**: Evaluates trades based on potential risks and downsides.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the situation with the experts' perspectives for Turn 10\nGiven that it's Turn 10 and there are no new offers from Player 0, we need to decide if Player 1 should make an offer.\n\n## Step 7: Decide on the next action based on the experts' advice\n1. **Value Maximizer**: Since the total value has increased from 1681 to 1779, the trades so far have been beneficial. The expert might suggest looking for opportunities that further increase the value.\n2. **Resource Balancer**: With the current distribution (Wheat: 8, Wood: 26, Sheep: 11, Brick: 20, Ore: 20), the expert might suggest balancing the resources. However, since there are no new offers, we must consider if making an offer could help.\n3. **Risk Manager**: This expert would caution against making risky trades, especially since there are no new offers from Player 0.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the best course of action for Turn 10\nGiven that Player 0 has not made a new offer and it's the last turn, the best action would be to not make a new offer if there's no clear beneficial trade to be made with the information available.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Deny]}$",

      "response": "To analyze the situation for Player 0 in the Negotiation Game effectively, let's have three different experts provide their insights based on their unique perspectives:\n\n### Expert 1: Resource Maximizer\n**Step 1:** \nAs a resource maximizer, I first examined the current inventory and values of Player 0:\n- Wheat: 8 x 6 = 48\n- Wood: 8 x 11 = 88\n- Sheep: 16 x 12 = 192\n- Brick: 21 x 27 = 567\n- Ore: 8 x 39 = 312\n\nTotal Value = 1213\n\nI see that Ore has the highest individual value. It may be beneficial to leverage the Ore for trades that provide higher-value resources or more versatile resources. Given that Player 0 has been rejected multiple times on their recent offers, it might be time to reconsider the approach or resource combination.\n\n---\n\n### Expert 2: Strategic Trader\n**Step 1:** \nAs a strategic trader, I notice that Player 0 initially traded Ore and Sheep for Brick, both of which are essential resources. However, the rejection of the last offer indicates that Player 1 may be hesitant to trade Sheep or recognizes they have enough of that resource. \n\nSuggesting a new offer to Player 1 involving the less abundant resources can provide a chance for both players to benefit\u2014perhaps offering an equal trade of Ore and Wood for a combination of Wheat and Brick. This way, I aim to improve my overall resource stock.\n\n---\n\n### Expert 3: Risk Analyst\n**Step 1:** \nAs a risk analyst, I evaluate the strategic risks of the current trades. Player 0 has made several trades and received a denial for critical offers lately. The fluctuation of accepted versus rejected offers indicates a potential misalignment in resource evaluation between players.\n\nPlayer 0 may consider alternative trades that diversify their resource combinations without over-relying on specific highly-valued resources, such as resources that can be more easily traded or utilized later on. My suggestion would be to offer resources that Player 1 might be collecting more of\u2014consider diversifying by proposing more Wheat or Wood.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\nFollowing these insights, Player 0 might want to re-evaluate their trading strategy:\n\n1. **Resource Maximizer**: Offer resources that leverage high values, balancing Ore with lower-value trades to optimize total gain.\n2. **Strategic Trader**: Present offers that provide value to Player 1 whilst increasing Player 0's stock of needed resources.\n3. **Risk Analyst**: Diversify offers beyond just high-value resources to prevent rejection and improve overall trading output.\n\nIn the next round, Player 0 can consider trading 4 Wood for Wheat or a combination that reduces their Sheep stock while balancing risks and maximizing long-term resource benefit potential.",

      "response": "To tackle this problem, I'll first assemble a team of three different trading experts: a Value Analyst, a Market Strategist, and a Risk Manager. Each will analyze the situation from their unique perspective.\n\n**Turn 1: Initial Analysis**\n\n- **Value Analyst**: Let's start by assessing the current value of Player1's resources. We have 12 Wheat (value: 5) = 60, 23 Wood (value: 9) = 207, 12 Sheep (value: 15) = 180, 14 Brick (value: 30) = 420, and 22 Ore (value: 37) = 814. The total value is 60 + 207 + 180 + 420 + 814 = 1681. We should look for trades that increase this total value.\n- **Market Strategist**: We're currently engaged with Player0, and we've had a few trades. Notably, we accepted two trades: gaining 5 Brick and 2 Sheep for 3 Sheep and 2 Ore, and gaining 4 Wood for 2 Ore. We should analyze the impact of these trades and consider our next move based on Player0's behavior and our resource needs.\n- **Risk Manager**: We need to be cautious about depleting our resources or becoming too dependent on a single resource. Our current quantities are: Wheat = 12, Wood = 27 (after gaining 4 Wood), Sheep = 12 - 3 + 2 = 11, Brick = 14 + 5 = 19, and Ore = 22 - 2 - 2 = 18. We must ensure our trades don't overly expose us to risk.\n\n**Turn 2: Evaluating Recent Trades**\n\n- **Value Analyst**: We've made some trades. Let's see how they've affected our total value. After the first trade, we gave up 3 Sheep (45) and 2 Ore (74) = 119, and got 5 Brick (150) and 2 Sheep (30) = 180. That's a gain of 61. The second trade, we gave up 2 Ore (74) and got 4 Wood (36), which is a loss of 38. The third trade, we gave 4 Wheat (20) and 1 Wood (9) = 29, and got 2 Ore (74) and 1 Brick (30) = 104, gaining 75. So, our net gain so far is 61 - 38 + 75 = 98.\n- **Market Strategist**: Player0 seems willing to trade valuable resources. We should consider what they're looking for and what we can offer. Their last offer was 3 Sheep for 1 Brick and 1 Ore, which we rejected. Let's analyze why we rejected it and what alternative trades we could propose.\n- **Risk Manager**: After the last trade, our Ore went from 22 to 18, and then to 20 (18 - 2 + 2 Ore from the third trade), and now we're at 20 - 1 = 19 Ore because of the trades with Player0. We should be cautious about losing more Ore.\n\n**Turn 3: Planning the Next Move**\n\nGiven that it's Turn 5 in the game and we have just analyzed our current situation, we need to plan our next trade carefully.\n\n- **Value Analyst**: We should look for opportunities to gain high-value resources or get rid of lower-value ones. Since we've gained some Brick and lost some Ore, let's consider trades that could further optimize our resource values.\n- **Market Strategist**: Let's propose a trade that could be attractive to Player0, perhaps offering some Wheat or Wood (lower value) for Ore or Brick (higher value). We could try: `[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]`.\n- **Risk Manager**: Before making a new offer, let's ensure we're not over-exposing ourselves. We have decent quantities across the board, but we should avoid trades that deplete our resources too much.\n\n**Turn 4: Executing the Plan**\n\nLet's execute the proposed trade: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]`. This is similar to our strategist's suggestion but adjusted slightly.\n\nThe final answer is: `[Offer:5 Wheat,2 Wood ->1 Ore,1 Brick]`",

      "response": "Let's summarize the current situation and analyze the trading options from three different expert perspectives: a Resource Value Expert, a Trade Strategy Expert, and a Negotiation Expert.\n\n### Current Resource Status of Player 0:\n- Wheat: 5 (after the last trade)\n- Wood: 4 (after the last trade)\n- Sheep: 13 (after the first trade)\n- Brick: 5 (after the first trade)\n- Ore: 6 (after the last trade)\n\n### Expert Analysis\n\n#### 1. Resource Value Expert\nThe Resource Value Expert focuses on the intrinsic value of each resource:\n- Wheat: Value 6 (5 left)\n- Wood: Value 11 (4 left)\n- Sheep: Value 12 (13 left)\n- Brick: Value 27 (5 left)\n- Ore: Value 39 (6 left)\n\n**Recommendation**: Given the high value of Ore and its scarcity, Player 0 should prioritize trades that increase the quantity of high-value resources like Ore and Brick. \n\n#### 2. Trade Strategy Expert\nThe Trade Strategy Expert focuses on optimizing trades for resource acquisition:\n- Considering the previous trades, Player 0 has successfully acquired more Brick and Ore. The last offer from Player 1 (4 Wheat, 2 Wood for 1 Ore, 1 Brick) is not worth accepting because it will lead to a limited gain of Brick and Ore, at the cost of too much Wheat and Wood.\n\n**Offer Calculation**: Instead, Player 0 could offer 5 Wheat (less than received from trades already established) for 2 Ore or 1 Brick. That channel focuses on gaining more valuable resources instead of giving away more assets without a fair return.\n\n#### 3. Negotiation Expert\nThe Negotiation Expert analyses player psychology and optimal approaches for negotiations:\n- Understanding that Player 1 might be seeking trade out of desperation due to lack of resources suggests that Player 0 can negotiate harder. \n\n**Approach**: Instead of outright rejecting the last offer, Player 0 could counter with a more beneficial proposal. For instance, a counter-offer could be beneficial: \n\n**Counter-Offer Example**: \n- \"[Offer: 3 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\"\n\n### Suggested Actions Based on Expert Analysis\n1. **Resource Value Expert Analysis**: Do not trade Wheat and Wood for Ore and Brick unless it's favorable. \n2. **Trade Strategy Expert Analysis**: Propose an alternate offer that maximizes the resource pool and capitalizes on the high-value resources.\n3. **Negotiation Expert Analysis**: Counter-offer strategically and be prepared to negotiate further to create a favorable deal.\n\n### Next Step\nPlayer 0 should proceed by presenting a counter-offer to Player 1.\n\n#### Final Action\n**Counter-Offer**: [Offer: 3 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
