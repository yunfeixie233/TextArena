      "response": "### Expert Analysis for Player 0's Trading Strategy\n\n**Expert 1: Value Maximizer**  \n*Step 1: Analyze Resource Values*  \nThe current values of Player 0's resources are:  \n- Wheat: 5 per unit  \n- Wood: 12 per unit  \n- Sheep: 12 per unit  \n- Brick: 28 per unit  \n- Ore: 39 per unit  \n\n**Total current value**:  \n- Wheat: 25 * 5 = 125  \n- Wood: 14 * 12 = 168  \n- Sheep: 24 * 12 = 288  \n- Brick: 8 * 28 = 224  \n- Ore: 16 * 39 = 624  \n\n**Grand Total Value**: 125 + 168 + 288 + 224 + 624 = **1429**  \n\nAs a value maximizer, I suggest focusing on trading low-value resources for high-value ones. Currently, Ore and Brick provide the highest value.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: Resource-Ratio Optimizer**  \n*Step 1: Determine Trading Ratios*  \nTo increase the total value, I need to analyze the potential trades based on trading ratios.  \n1. **1 Brick** = 28 value  \n2. **1 Ore** = 39 value  \n3. **1 Sheep** = 12 value  \n\nTrading high-value resources for low-value resources can yield better returns. For instance, trading some Ore for Sheep or Wood could be beneficial as it benefits my total value if weighted correctly.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: Market Tracker**  \n*Step 1: Research Current Market Trends*  \nIn order to make a beneficial trade, I must keep an eye on market preferences. Resources like Brick might be in high demand if trades are currently favoring construction or commodities.\n\nFor example, if a neighboring player has a high demand for Brick, it would be advantageous to offer some Ore (worth 39) to acquire multiple Bricks, considering their market value, which is significantly lower per unit.\n\n---\n\n### Turn 1: Offer Proposal  \nAs a collaborative decision based on the experts, I'd create the following offer to boost my resources:\n\n**[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]**\n\nThis trade would allows me to exchange some of my lower-value Sheep for higher-value Brick, plus retaining some Sheep which can be used in further trades.\n\n### Next Step - Await Response\nI will wait for others' responses to my trade offer. If they accept, we will assess the new total values. If denied, we will revisit and suggest alternative trade offers.",

      "response": "### Expert Analysis\n\n**Expert 1: Economic Strategist**\n1. **Initial Thoughts**: I see that I have a large quantity of resources, particularly Ore. The current values indicate that Ore holds a significant value at 39, while Brick has a combined value of 28 for 8 units. The goal is to maximize utility, so trading high-value single resources for moderate-value groups could be beneficial.\n2. **Next Move**: Since my offer was rejected, I should consider a new trade. I can possibly offer a trade involving my Wheat, which has a lower value (5) to see if I can attract a trade for higher-value resources.\n\n**Expert 2: Resource Optimizer**\n1. **Initial Thoughts**: Given the resources at hand, I notice that I have too many low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) compared to my high-value Ore and Brick. I should focus on consolidating my low-value resources into more valuable ones. \n2. **Next Move**: I believe I should trade away my Wooden resources for either Ore or Brick, as these have higher trade values. I will prepare an offer to trade 4 Wood for 2 Ore.\n\n**Expert 3: Risk Analyst**\n1. **Initial Thoughts**: The rejection of the previous offer is a point of concern. Understanding the motivations behind rejections is crucial. It may indicate that Player 1 perceives the trade as unfavorable. I would analyze player tendencies before making a new offer.\n2. **Next Move**: I will wait for player 1 to make an offer since I believe being reactive might present better opportunities. In the meantime, I\u2019ll reassess the value of each resource and maintain a flexible strategy.\n\n### Proposed Moves\n\n**Expert 1**:  \n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\n\n**Expert 2**:  \n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Ore]\n\n**Expert 3**:  \n[Hold position, wait for Player 1 to respond]\n\n### Current Strategy\nSince Player 1 has not made a new offer, it's up to us to initiate trades that can lead to an increase in the total value of resources effectively.",

      "response": "In the Negotiation Game, it\u2019s important to maximize the total value of resources through strategic trades. Let's analyze this situation from the perspectives of three different types of experts: an Economic Analyst, a Market Strategist, and a Risk Assessor.\n\n### Economic Analyst\n**Step 1:** The Economic Analyst\u2019s first focus is on calculating the total value of the resources available and determining the best trades based on those values. \n- Current total values:\n  - Wheat: 25 * 5 = 125\n  - Wood: 14 * 12 = 168\n  - Sheep: 24 * 12 = 288\n  - Brick: 8 * 28 = 224\n  - Ore: 16 * 39 = 624\n- The total value of Player 0\u2019s resources: 125 + 168 + 288 + 224 + 624 = **1429**.\n\n**Step 2:** Analyzing the offers made, Player 0 could gain more value by acquiring additional Wood or Ore since those resources are high-value, given their current market value. However, the trades have not been successful so far, suggesting Player 1 may not see equal value in the offers.\n\n---\n\n### Market Strategist\n**Step 1:** The Market Strategist analyzes the trading patterns.\n- Player 0's offers have been rejected multiple times, indicating that Player 1 values their resources (especially Ore) highly and may be unwilling to trade them for less valuable resources.\n  \n**Step 2:** The strategist believes an effective way to approach the situation would be to offer trades that include resources Player 1 may desire. For example, Player 0 could try offering fewer or more valuable resources that align with Player 1's needs.\n\n---\n\n### Risk Assessor\n**Step 1:** The Risk Assessor examines the possible risks of rejection based on current offers that were made and rejected.\n- There is an evident market imbalance. Player 0 is offering low-value trades for high-value resources like Ore, which leads to rejection. Player 1\u2019s offer of 3 Ore for 7 Wood is also exploitative to Player 0.\n\n**Step 2:** Advise: Player 0 should refrain from making overtly favorable offers to Player 1 that offer little upside. Instead, they should consider building a more balanced trade where both parties can see mutual value\u2014for instance, by bundling more diverse resources.\n\n---\n\nNow it's Player 0's turn to respond to Player 1's offer of 3 Ore for 7 Wood:\nGiven that Player 0 values Ore at 39 each and Wood at 12 each, this trade is not favorable.\n\n**Response:**\n- Player 0 calculates that 3 Ore = 3 * 39 = 117 and 7 Wood = 7 * 12 = 84. \nSince 117 is greater than 84, Player 0 should reject this offer.\n\nThus, the next action will be:\n- **[Deny]**\n\nAfter denial, Player 0 should think about making a better offer perhaps focusing on different item combinations that might entice Player 1 or wait for them to propose again.",

      "response": "To maximize your resources in the Negotiation Game, let's introduce three different trading experts each analyzing your situation from their distinct perspectives.\n\n### Expert 1: The Resource Optimizer\n**Step 1**: Analyze the Value of Current Resources  \n**Analysis**:  \n- Wheat: 25 qty * 5 = 125  \n- Wood: 14 qty * 12 = 168  \n- Sheep: 24 qty * 12 = 288  \n- Brick: 8 qty * 28 = 224  \n- Ore: 16 qty * 39 = 624  \n**Total Value**: 125 + 168 + 288 + 224 + 624 = 1429  \n\n**Decision**: I need to focus on trading to acquire resources that will increase my total value, particularly aiming for high-value items like Brick and Ore.\n\n---\n\n### Expert 2: The Trade Strategist\n**Step 2**: Review Current Offers  \n**Analysis**:  \n- Player 1 rejected my initial offers, implying they are looking for different values or quantities in the exchange.  \n- Their offer of 3 Ore for 10 Wheat seems unfavorable by comparison since Wheat has a significantly lower total value against Ore.  \n**Decision**: I should analyze what the strengths and weaknesses of both players are. Since trades have been failing, I must consider altering my strategy significantly.\n\n---\n\n### Expert 3: The Risk Manager\n**Step 3**: Evaluate Trade Risks  \n**Analysis**:  \n- To enhance my resource pool without making risky trades, I should ensure the offerings don\u2019t compromise my existing strong resources (Ore and Brick).  \n- Player 1's last offer (3 Wood for 1 Brick, 1 Sheep) could be a low-risk option. If accepted, I could further negotiate small holdings with lower value resources to counterbalance something greater if needed.  \n**Decision**: I recommend considering accepting their last offer cautiously, which could allow for more maneuvering space in future trades and preserve higher-value items.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n**Combined Advice**:\nAfter reviewing the perspectives of these experts, Player 0 (Yourself) should:\n- Consider accepting Player 1's offer of **3 Wood for 1 Brick, 1 Sheep**. This trade opens space for additional negotiations and allows you to preserve your higher-value resources while slightly diversifying your holdings. \n- Moving forward, focus on gauging the values of other players' offers relative to your existing resources. If they do not move in a favorable direction, consider adjusting your offers based on what's being rejected or accepted. \n\n**Proposed Action**:\n- Accept Player 1's offer: **'[Accept]'**",

Value delta = (7 \u00d7 15) \u2013 (3 \u00d7 35) = 70\u2013105 = \u201335  \n\u2026but Player 0 has repeatedly offered 5 Sheep for 3 Ore and keeps getting refused (they want **more** Sheep).  \nThus my 3 Ore -> 7 Sheep gives him exactly what he always asked, yet it also nets *me* a loss; I was wrong. Withdrawing.\u201d  \n*[Market-Aggregator Expert leaves.]*\n\n**Scarcity-Tuner Expert:**  \n\u201cAt 12 Wheat, 12 Wheat is now a \u2018glut\u2019; marginal utility near zero.  \nWood at 5 is only \u2018tight\u2019.  \nSheep and Brick hover near \u2018balance\u2019.  \nOre at 20 is a surplus with diminishing marginal return.  \nThus I want rid of Ore in any high-value form.  \nLooking at Player 0\u2019s prior bid history he values *Brick* heavily.  \nHe offered 5 Sheep+Wood just to acquire 3 Ore.  \nSo I will flip the script: offer *some* Ore to get Brick.  \n[Offer: 2 Ore \u2192 4 Brick].  \nDelta = (4\u00d721) \u2013 (2\u00d735) = 84 \u2013 70 = +14 per turn. He previously showed Brick is abundant for him, so he might accept.  \nIf not, up Ore to 3\u21925 Brick (+3 value). I\u2019ll start conservative.\u201d\n\n**Portfolio-Optimizer Expert:**  \n\u201cI disagree: Brick is valuable already. Risk lies in Wood\u2019s low count.  \nOnly **4 Wood** left after earlier trade.  \nI\u2019d rather diversify downward:  \nOffer the highest-value glut (Ore) for Wood+Sheep combo.  \n[Offer: 2 Ore \u2192 5 Wood + 1 Sheep]  \nDelta: (5\u00d79 + 1\u00d715) \u2013 (2\u00d735) = 60 \u2013 70 = \u201310.  \nIt\u2019s slightly negative, but Wood becomes a shield in final turns if final scoring values shift.  \nHowever, this yields direct negative value, violating the strict maximize-value rule.\u201d *[expert decides this violates the goal, so steps back but stays.]*\n\n---\n\nConsensus after Step 1, Round 1  \nOnly the Scarcity-Tuner\u2019s 2 Ore \u2192 4 Brick suggestion has a clear positive delta and fits Player 0\u2019s historic valuation.\n\n***Step 2 \u2013 Refining the offer***  \nWe test 2 \u2192 4: that\u2019s a 1:2 rate.  \nPlayer 0 earlier proposed 5 Sheep+Wood (valued roughly 5\u00d715+2\u00d79 = 93) for 3 Ore (105).  \nHe was willing to overpay by 12 net, so 2 Ore for 4 Brick (+14 to me) sits well within the *same* generosity ratio he already displayed.  \n\nWe therefore push the precise offer:\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 4 Brick]\n\nIf Player 0 rejects it, in the next turn we increase the Ore to 3 \u2192 5 Brick (delta = +12, almost as good).\n\nThat is Player 1\u2019s move for Turn 8.",

      "response": "Let's analyze the situation from the perspectives of three different trading experts to determine the best negotiation strategy moving forward. Each expert has unique skills and insights into value maximization in trades.\n\n### Expert 1: The Resource Valuator\nThis expert focuses on the value of the resources being traded and seeks maximum value from trades.\n\n1. **Current Value Assessment:**\n   - Wheat: 5 (qty: 25) \u2192 Value: 125\n   - Wood: 12 (qty: 14) \u2192 Value: 168\n   - Sheep: 12 (qty: 24) \u2192 Value: 288\n   - Brick: 28 (qty: 8) \u2192 Value: 224\n   - Ore: 39 (qty: 16) \u2192 Value: 624\n   - **Total Value:** 1429\n\n2. **Trade Considerations:**\n   - The latest trade with Player 1 (3 Wood for 1 Brick, 1 Sheep) was accepted, improving resource diversity.\n   - The offer from Player 1 of 3 Ore for 7 Sheep is unfavorable since it trades high-value Ore for lower-value Sheep.\n\n### Expert 2: The Market Strategist\nThis expert examines the moves of Player 1 and past offers to create a competitive trading strategy.\n\n1. **Analysis of Player 1\u2019s Strategies:**\n   - Player 1 is attempting to negotiate the value of Ore (3 Ore for 10 Wheat, and then 3 Ore for 7 Sheep), indicating desperation or an eagerness to trade away Ore.\n   - Player 1\u2019s past rejections imply they are not looking for less valuable resources and might be struggling to get better deals.\n\n2. **Best Next Move:**\n   - Attempt to leverage the current offers from Player 1 to strike a deal with better value, avoiding any offer that will not yield a 10% value increase from current resources.\n\n### Expert 3: The Negotiation Psychologist\nThis expert focuses on the psychology behind trades and how to best manipulate the negotiation process.\n\n1. **Understanding Player 1\u2019s Intentions:**\n   - Player 1 is either under pressure or lacks favorable resources themselves. When they keep rejecting, it may signal they're fishing for a better deal or assessing your patience.\n   - By accepting their last offer, you have opened the door for more favorable trades, but caution must be taken not to appear desperate.\n\n2. **Future Tactics:**\n   - Use the accepted trade as leverage for future trades. Establish you have resources they need (like Wood and Ore) and challenge them to present a fair offer.\n\n### Next Steps in the Game\nGiven the insights from the experts, here is what Player 0 should consider doing:\n\n- Keep a keen eye on the trading landscape. \n- Prepare an attractive offer that might entice Player 1 while not undervaluing own resources or desperation.\n- Consider an offer based on resources Player 1 seems to need, such as a balanced offer of Wood or Sheep for their Ore.\n\n### Suggested Player 0 Action:\n1. Formulate a new offer to Player 1 to encourage a trade without pushing them away.\n  \n#### Proposed Trade Offer:\n`[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Ore]` \n\n**Rationale:** This offer exchanges resources that Player 1 has shown an interest in while increasing Player 0\u2019s Ore value, which is the most beneficial resource for future trades. \n\nPlease proceed with this trade strategy for turn progression.",
