      "response": "In your situation as Player 0, bringing in three different types of trading experts can provide you with varied insights and strategies for maximizing your resource value. Below are the experts I recommend, each offering their unique perspective.\n\n### Expert 1: Resource Value Analyst\n**Step 1:** The Resource Value Analyst assesses the current state of your resources. \n- Wheat (15 * 5 = 75)\n- Wood (9 * 9 = 81)\n- Sheep (12 * 17 = 204)\n- Brick (23 * 30 = 690)\n- Ore (13 * 40 = 520)\n\n**Total Value:** 75 + 81 + 204 + 690 + 520 = 1570\n\n**Analysis:** I suggest focusing on trading resources that are valuable and in excess. Sheep and Ore seem to be high-value resources, while Wheat, although numerous, has a relatively low value. \n\n**Action Recommendation:** Consider trading excess Wheat or even Wood for more high-value resources like Ore or Brick, as they have higher market potential.\n\n### Expert 2: Market Strategy Specialist\n**Step 1:** The Market Strategy Specialist evaluates potential market demand for various resources.\n- Many players may need Brick for building. \n- Ore is primarily used for upgrades, and Sheep for crafting certain tools and buildings.\n\n**Analysis:** Based on anticipated trades, I can predict that Brick will hold better value in upcoming turns. Offering excess Ore (high value) for Brick could be beneficial, considering the scarcity of Brick in the market.\n\n**Action Recommendation:** I propose the initial trade: \n[Offer: 3 Ore -> 5 Brick].\n\n### Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician\n**Step 1:** The Negotiation Tactician examines negotiation strategies to maximize gains while minimizing losses. \n- Finding a middle ground is key; make trades that not only benefit you but also entice opponents.\n\n**Analysis:** Understanding the players\u2019 motivations is crucial. If another player is nearing a stage where Brick is essential for them, they may be willing to give up more for that resource in exchange for something they see less value in.\n\n**Action Recommendation:** I suggest reinforcing offers based on what players might value. I\u2019ll analyze trades that involve a reasonable exchange where I offer less valued resources for mediums like Brick or Ore.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Each expert will wait for the group response on the proposed trades and strategize on any feedback or offers received.\n\n**Current Moves:**\n1. [Offer: 3 Ore -> 5 Brick]\n2. [Deny] (for now; waiting for responses)\n\nLet's proceed with the negotiations and see if any offers come in for the proposed trades.",

      "response": "To tackle this task effectively, let's first assess the current situation and the offer made by Player 0.\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - [Wheat]   Qty: 18   Value: 5\n   - [Wood]    Qty: 20   Value: 8\n   - [Sheep]   Qty: 18   Value: 14\n   - [Brick]   Qty: 23   Value: 27\n   - [Ore]     Qty: 21   Value: 37\n\n2. **Player 0's Offer:**\n   - Offered items: 3 Ore -> Requested items: 5 Brick\n\nLet's analyze this offer with the help of three different trading experts: a Value Analyst, a Resource Strategist, and a Risk Manager.\n\n### Expert Analysis\n\n#### Turn 1:\n1. **Value Analyst:** Let's calculate the total value of the resources involved in the trade. We are being offered 3 Ore. Since Ore is valued at 37, 3 Ore = 3 * 37 = 111. In return, they are asking for 5 Brick. Since Brick is valued at 27, 5 Brick = 5 * 27 = 135. The trade is not in our favor as we are losing value (135 - 111 = 24).\n\n2. **Resource Strategist:** We need to consider if the trade aligns with our resource strategy. We have 23 Brick and are asked to give up 5, which is approximately 21.7% of our Brick. We have 21 Ore and are offered 3 more, increasing our Ore to 24, which is an increase of about 14.3%. The trade slightly diversifies our resources but let's see if it's beneficial.\n\n3. **Risk Manager:** Assessing the risk, we are giving up a significant amount of Brick (5 units) for a gain of Ore (3 units). We should consider if we are at risk of having too much Ore or too little Brick after the trade. Currently, we have a substantial amount of both, but losing 5 Brick might not be ideal.\n\n#### Decision for Turn 1:\nGiven the initial analysis, it seems the trade is not highly favorable due to the value loss.\n\n#### Action for Turn 1:\nSince the value analyst has raised a concern about the trade not being in our favor value-wise, and considering our task is to increase the total value of our resources, we'll likely need to deny this offer.\n\nLet's directly analyze the decision:\n- The offer involves giving away 5 Brick (valued at 135) for 3 Ore (valued at 111), resulting in a net loss of value.\n- Therefore, the logical action is to deny the offer.\n\n**Action:** `[Deny]`\n\nLet's proceed with the understanding that our next steps will depend on the reactions and potential counteroffers from Player 0 or other developments in the game. \n\nSince we've made our decision for this turn, we'll wait for the next turn's developments. \n\nLet's move to the next turn. \n\n#### Turn 2:\nWaiting for Player 0's next action or offer... \n\nLet's assume Player 0 either makes a new offer or we can make a counteroffer.\n\nSince the format and the next steps are dependent on the game's progression, let's directly jump to a potential counteroffer or a new action based on our initial decision.\n\nGiven the initial offer was denied, we should be prepared to either receive a new offer or make a counteroffer. Let's consider making a counteroffer that could be beneficial.\n\nLet's analyze potential trades that could be beneficial:\n- We have a lot of Brick and Ore, so trading some of these for other resources could be beneficial if the value is right.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer:\n`[Offer: 4 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood]`\n\nThis is just a placeholder for a potential trade. Let's evaluate it:\n- We give away 4 Brick (4*27 = 108) and receive 1 Ore (37) and 1 Wood (8), totaling 45. The net loss is 63, which is not favorable.\n\nLet's think of a better counteroffer.\n\n### Potential Counteroffer:\nLet's directly formulate a beneficial trade.\n`[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 4 Wood]`\nLet's check its value:\n- We give away 2 Sheep (2*14 = 28) and 1 Ore (37), totaling 65.\n- We receive 4 Wood (4*8 = 32).\nThe trade is not favorable as it results in a net loss of 33.\n\nLet's directly formulate another trade.\n`[Offer: 5 Brick -> 3 Ore]`\n- We give away 5 Brick (5*27 = 135).\n- We receive 3 Ore (3*37 = 111).\nThis trade still results in a net loss of 24, similar to Player 0's initial offer.\n\nLet's think of a more balanced trade.\n\n### Another Potential Counteroffer:\n`[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]`\n- We give away 2 Brick (2*27 = 54).\n- We receive 1 Ore (37).\nThis results in a net loss of 17.\n\nAfter assessing a few options, it seems challenging to make a significantly beneficial trade without more context on what Player 0 or others might offer.\n\nLet's directly decide on an action for the current turn, based on our own resource optimization strategy.\n\n**Action for a Potential Counteroffer:** `[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]` could be a starting point, but let's directly analyze if it's worth it.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need to follow the format to the letter, the final decision should directly reflect the action to be taken.\n\nGiven our current strategy and the initial denial of Player 0's offer, a more nuanced or different trade is needed. \n\nFor the sake of the game, let's directly choose an action.\n\n**Action:** `[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]`",

Gaining 1 Wood adds versatility for future trades.\n\n2. **Recommendation:**  \n   Accept the offer from Player 1. The trade not only increases resources' total value but also optimizes future trading potential.\n\n---\n\n**Market Analysis Expert:**\n1. **Current Market Trends Analysis:**  \n   - At present, Ore appears to be quite valuable as it fetches a high price in the current market, making it less favorable to deplete stock unless absolutely necessary.  \n   - Wood could also become crucial in upcoming trades or towards building.\n\n2. **Recommendation:**  \n   Even though the trade currently seems profitable, evaluate future availability of Ore and Wood in the market. If these resources appear to dwindle, it may not be wise to trade them away. However, as of now, the net gain is substantial enough to lean towards accepting the offer.\n\n---\n\nAfter analyzing Player 1's offer collectively:\n\n- From the Value Maximization Expert: **Accept the trade** based on significant gain.  \n- From the Resource Management Expert: **Accept the trade** while maintaining a good stock of Brick and valuable resources.  \n- From the Market Analysis Expert: **Consider market trends**, but the immediate gain is too valuable to ignore.\n\nGiven the consensus leaning towards acceptance, I will proceed to:\n\n**[Accept]**",

I must maximize my trade benefit relative to my resource values.\n2. **Current Situation**: I accepted a trade with Player 1 for 4 Brick in exchange for 1 Ore and 1 Wood. This trade was beneficial as it allowed me to dispose of lower-value Wood while acquiring multiple lower-value Bricks that could be further traded.\n3. **Next Move**: I have noticed that Wood exists in considerable quantities. I could potentially use my wealth of Brick and movement towards acquiring higher-value resources.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: Aggressive Negotiator**\n1. **Initial Strategy**: To obtain more high-value resources (like Ore and Wheat), I should consider using my position to trade longer-term by offering combinations that lead to multi-resource trades.\n2. **Current Situation**: I've rejected the trade offer from Player 1 because the value of 3 Brick for 2 Ore was not worth it. I believe seeking out better trades that use high-value Orchards could be a better tactic.\n3. **Next Move**: It would be wise to offer a larger quantity of Sheep or Ore in exchange for a split of resources that cover a broader area, potentially including an assertion of my 'needs'.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: Strategic Resource Allocator**\n1. **Initial Insight**: The goal is to manage resource conversions strategically to lead to long-term asset accumulation. My resources must be secured by combining lower value with higher value.\n2. **Current Situation**: Recognizing I have too much Brick and Wood, I should begin to focus on trades that will enhance my Ore stockpile, as Ore can yield higher-value trades in the future.\n3. **Next Move**: I should evaluate a potential proposal to trade combinations of Wood and Ore for higher-value resources to regain balance in my resource management.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps as Player 0**:\nGiven these perspectives, I will construct my next trade offer keeping in mind resource values and the need to make strategic trades:\n\n1. **Proposed Offer**: To Player 1, I will offer: [Offer: 5 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 2 Ore].\n\nBy focusing on trying to convert Wood into resources that will enhance my Ore stockpile, this move aligns with the insights provided by Expert 2 and Expert 3 while still keeping the resource values in check as evaluated by Expert 1. \n\nNow, I await Player 1's response to my new offer.",

After the last trades, the Ore quantity has decreased (initially 21, after giving 1 Ore to Player 0 it became 20, and now it's still 20 after considering the previous turn's actions).\n   - The trade involves giving up a highly valued resource for less valued ones. This expert is likely to advise against the trade due to the potential risk of reducing the total value.\n\nGiven the current situation and the offer made by Player 0, let's evaluate it:\n- Player 1 has: \n  - Wheat: 18\n  - Wood: 20 + 1 (from the previous trade) = 21\n  - Sheep: 18\n  - Brick: 23 - 4 (from the previous trade) = 19\n  - Ore: 21 - 1 (from the previous trade) = 20\n\nThe offer is: [Offered: 5 Wood, 1 Wheat -> Requested: 2 Ore]\n- After accepting: \n  - Wheat: 18 + 1 = 19\n  - Wood: 21 + 5 = 26\n  - Sheep: 18\n  - Brick: 19\n  - Ore: 20 - 2 = 18\n\nLet's calculate the change in total value:\n- Gained: 5 Wood (5*8 = 40) + 1 Wheat (1*5 = 5) = 45\n- Lost: 2 Ore (2*37 = 74)\n- Net change: 45 - 74 = -29\n\nThe total value after the trade would be: 1900 + (-29) = 1871.\n\nAll experts are likely to advise against accepting this trade due to the negative net change in value.\n\n**Decision**: \n[Deny]\n\nThe final action for this turn is to deny the offer made by Player 0.",

Let's analyze the situation by generating three distinct expert perspectives that could offer relevant insights.\n\n**Expert 1: Economic Strategist**\n- *Step 1*: Analyze Resource Values\n  - Current Resources:\n    - Wheat: 15 Qty, Value: 5 (Total: 75)\n    - Wood: 9 Qty, Value: 9 (Total: 81)\n    - Sheep: 12 Qty, Value: 17 (Total: 204)\n    - Brick: 23 Qty, Value: 30 (Total: 690)\n    - Ore: 13 Qty, Value: 40 (Total: 520)\n  - Total Value: 75 + 81 + 204 + 690 + 520 = 1570\n\n*Follow-Up Action*: Consider the offers on the table with potential for value gain.\n\n**Expert 2: Trade Negotiator**\n- *Step 1*: Identify the Strengths in Current Trading Offers\n  - Player 1's current offer: 5 Wood, 1 Wheat for 2 Ore was rejected twice. This indicates a potential undervaluation of Player 0's resources.\n  - Player 0's initial offer of 3 Ore for 5 Brick was rejected, showing that Player 1 is likely valuing Brick higher than Ore.\n\n*Follow-Up Action*: Propose a different offer to Player 1 that includes more desirable resources for Player 1 or renegotiate with an item boost.\n\n**Expert 3: Resource Optimization Analyst**\n- *Step 1*: Assess Resource Allocation\n  - Given that Ore holds the highest single item value at 40, it may be wise to keep more Ore.\n  - Brick, although it was previously desired, could be traded for lower-valued resources to fulfill quantity-based trades.\n\n*Follow-Up Action*: Focus on trading lower-valued resources such as Wood and Wheat while keeping Ore and Sheep, which might yield better long-term trades.\n\n### Next Actions from Each Expert:\n\n**Economic Strategist:**  \nGiven Player 0\u2019s acceptance of the offer from Player 1, it retains a substantial amount of resources. To increase overall value, I suggest making a counter-offer for either more limited resources or a strategic trade leveraging higher-value exchanges.\n\n**Trade Negotiator:**  \nNext, reach out to Player 1 with an adjusted offer considering their rejections. A potential offer could be: \n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Ore, 3 Brick]. \n\n**Resource Optimization Analyst:**  \nPrioritize keeping any trades beneficial in keeping significant quantities of high-value items. Next, I suggest to Player 0 to make an offer focused on obtaining more Ore or similar high-value items while offering away lower-value resources, for example: \n[Offer: 5 Wood -> Request: 2 Ore].\n\n### Actions to take next\nWith the insights gained from the experts, it may be prudent to propose a new offer to leverage the current trading dynamics and optimize resource retention while maximizing gaining higher-value resources. \n\n*Conclusion*: Time to make the next strategic trade offer or reassess Player 0's current resources and the dynamics of rejection from Player 1, potentially moving to another trading partner or taking a break to reassess values.",

      "response": "In the current negotiation scenario, you (Player 0) have made various trade offers but seen a mix of rejections and acceptance. To strategize effectively moving forward, let\u2019s consult three different types of experts who can provide varied perspectives on trading:\n\n### Expert 1: Economic Analyst\n**Thinking:** The goal is to maximize the total value of resources. Since I have accepted offers that provided me with Ore in exchange for other resources, I need to evaluate the current ratios of resources. After trading for Ore, which has the highest value, it may be beneficial to offload Wheat and Wood since they have lower individual valuations. \n**Next Step:** Assess the remaining resources and value ratios after the previous trades. I will analyze possible offers that can favorably exchange low-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n### Expert 2: Negotiation Strategist\n**Thinking:** In negotiations, it's crucial to read the behavior of your opponent. Player 1 rejected some of my favorable offers while accepting offers returning Ore. This indicates that they could be looking for a balance of resources that does not include the highest-valued ones (Ore and Brick). Therefore, I should leverage this to offer less value in return while targeting resources that they have available that may help me gain more Ore or enhance my resource strategy.\n**Next Step:** I will propose a trade that uses my lower-value resources to target Player 1's interests further, possibly suggesting something like 5 Wood for 2 Ore or 4 Sheep for similar offerings. The aim is to keep the negotiations active.\n\n### Expert 3: Risk Assessor\n**Thinking:** Each trade has its risk and reward balance. Given that I have already made favorable trades recently, I can afford to wait or trade cautiously. My current trades have notably increased my Ore count, which dramatically improves my trading power because of its higher value. However, if I get rejected on multiple fronts, my reputation might affect future trades. I need to ensure that I do not lose momentum.\n**Next Step:** Consider a safe offer that blends multiple lower-value resources for a mix of Ore and Brick. For example, offering 3 Wood and 4 Sheep would target resources while keeping something on the table for negotiation.\n\n### Conclusions and Next Action:\nConsidering the advice of the experts, Player 0 should propose the following offer to Manouver through negotiations effectively based on prior interactions:\n\n**Next Offer:**\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 5 Wood -> 3 Ore] \n\nThis offer maintains a balance of offering lower-value resources while aiming for the high-value Ore sought by Player 1. It takes into consideration previous offers observed, positions my resource strategy effectively, and keeps negotiations open and dynamic.",
