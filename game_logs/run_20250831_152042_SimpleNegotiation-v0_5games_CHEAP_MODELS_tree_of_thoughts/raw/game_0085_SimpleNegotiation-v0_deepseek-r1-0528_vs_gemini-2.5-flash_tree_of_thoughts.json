      "response": "### Round 1: Expert Discussions  \n**Expert 1 (Value Maximizer):**  \n\"My goal is to boost total resource value. Wheat (5/unit) and Wood (8/unit) are our lowest-value resources. Sheep (18/unit) sits at a good mid-tier value\u2014higher than Wheat/Wood but lower than Brick/Ore. Trading away surplus Wheat/Wood for Sheep can net us immediate gains. Specifically:  \n- Offering **5 Wheat (value 25) + 3 Wood (value 24) = 49 total value**  \n- Requesting **3 Sheep (value 54) = 54 total value**  \nThis yields a **+5 value gain** for us. Brick (23) and Ore (32) are too valuable to trade away lightly; we defend these unless a huge upside appears.\"  \n\n**Expert 2 (Resource Balancer):**  \n\"I focus equity. We have:  \n- High surpluses: Brick (24) and moderate Wheat/Wood.  \n- Moderate deficits: Sheep (only 12) and Ore (12) relative to Brick.  \nTrading **Wheat/Wood \u2192 Sheep** makes sense: it balances our portfolio by shrinking low-value stockpiles and boosting a scarcer, higher-value resource. Don\u2019t touch Ore/Brick yet\u2014they\u2019re long-term value anchors. The **5 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 3 Sheep** trade fits: it converts 8 low-impact units into 3 high-impact ones.\"  \n\n**Expert 3 (Opportunist Trader):**  \n\"I prioritize what\u2019s *tradable*. Ore/Brick are premium but hard to acquire\u2014no one trades Ore cheaply. Sheep is a safer target with mid-range demand. Bundling low-value resources (Wheat/Wood) into a Sheep offer is attractive for someone flush with Sheep but needing basics. Quantity-wise: 5 Wheat + 3 Wood for 3 Sheep is appealing because it looks like a \u2018bulk discount\u2019\u2014we demand 3 Sheep but offer 8 items. It\u2019s likely to tempt opponents, risking minimal value if counteroffered.\"  \n\n### Consensus-Based Action  \nAfter debate, all experts agree: **Offer 5 Wheat and 3 Wood for 3 Sheep**. This:  \n- **Increases total value by +5** (49 given \u2192 54 received).  \n- Targets a weak spot (low-value surplus) while strengthening Sheep stores.  \n- Poses minimal risk\u2014no high-value resources are exposed.  \n\n---  \n**Player 0's Action:**  \n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 3 Sheep]",

      "response": "As Player 0, I understand the goal is to increase my total resource value through trading. My current resource values are: Wheat (5 each), Wood (8 each), Sheep (18 each), Brick (23 each), and Ore (32 each). Player 1 rejected my previous offer of 5 Wheat and 3 Wood for 3 Sheep and made no new offer. I must now decide on a new action for this turn.\n\nTo approach this, I imagine three expert advisors with different perspectives:\n- **Value Maximizer (Expert 1)**: Focuses on trading to gain net value based on resource values.\n- **Resource Balancer (Expert 2)**: Aims to adjust resource quantities for better flexibility.\n- **Opponent Modeler (Expert 3)**: Considers Player 1's likely behavior based on the rejected offer.\n\nThey will discuss in steps, following the rules: if experts realize they're wrong, they leave; otherwise, they build on each other's thoughts.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Thoughts\n- **Expert 1**: \"The key is to trade low-value resources for high-value ones to gain net value. My previous offer (5 Wheat + 3 Wood for 3 Sheep) would have gained 5 net value for me (49 given vs. 54 received). Player 1 rejected it, so I must adjust. Sheep (value 18) is still attractive, but I should avoid overpaying. Offering 6 Wheat and 2 Wood for 3 Sheep is efficient: it gives 46 value (6\u00d75 + 2\u00d78) and gains 8 net value for me if Player 1 accepts.\"\n- **Expert 2**: \"I need to reduce surplus resources like Brick (24 units) or Wheat (12 units) while acquiring scarcer items. Sheep and Ore are limited in quantity (12 each). However, giving Brick risks high value loss (23 per unit), so Wheat and Wood are better to trade. Offering more Wheat (low-value surplus) for Sheep (high-value and moderate quantity) makes sense. I suggest 6 Wheat and 3 Wood for 3 Sheep to address rejection, but that costs 54 value (break-even) which isn't ideal.\"\n- **Expert 3**: \"Player 1's rejection of the Sheep-focused offer suggests they value Sheep highly or don't need Wheat/Wood. Since Player 1 made no new offer, they might possess ample Sheep or lack incentives. Targeting Ore (if Player 1 has excess) could work, but I lack data. Revising the Sheep offer by increasing the ratio slightly (e.g., 6 Wheat and 2 Wood for 3 Sheep) may appeal if Player 1 undervalues Wheat/Wood relative to Sheep.\"\n\n### Step 2: Revised Thoughts After Sharing\n- **Expert 1**: \"Good points. Avoid trading Brick\u2014it's high-value despite surplus. Ore is too valuable (32) for cost-effective acquisition; even 4 Wood for 1 Ore is break-even (32 to 32) and gains no value. Sticking with Sheep and increasing the offer slightly (6 Wheat + 2 Wood for 3 Sheep) maintains my gain of 8 value. Expert 2's 54 value proposal loses appeal\u2014no gain. Expert 3's Ore idea risks overpayment.\"\n- **Expert 2** (leaves after Step 1): \"My 6 Wheat + 3 Wood idea (54 value) has no net gain, which doesn't help. I was wrong to prioritize breakeven, so I'll step aside.\"\n- **Expert 3**: \"With Expert 2 leaving, let's refine. Offering a new resource like Ore might confuse Player 1 post-rejection. Instead, sweeten the Sheep deal minimally without losing value. 6 Wheat + 2 Wood for 3 Sheep is smart\u2014it improves the offer (more Wheat, less Wood) and increases Player 1's perceived gain if they devalue Wheat/Wood. Repeating similar trades can build acceptance patterns.\"\n\n### Step 3: Final Consensus for Action\n- **Expert 1**: \"Agree with Expert 3. 6 Wheat + 2 Wood for 3 Sheep offers clear value gain for me (46 given, 54 received/+8 net) and no risk. It builds on history without drastic changes.\"\n- **Expert 3**: \"Yes, it's consistent and responsive to Player 1's cues. If rejected again, we reevaluate later.\"\n\n**Decision**: The experts recommend an optimized trade to increase my total value while considering Player 1's behavior. I propose:\n- [Offer: 6 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Sheep]",

They'll discuss step-by-step to refine the decision. \n\n---\n\n#### Expert Step 1: Initial Analysis\n- **Value Maximizer**: \"Our goal is to increase total value. Wheat (value 5) and Wood (value 8) are low-value\u2014getting rid of them for higher-value resources like Sheep (value 18) is ideal. Last two offers gave net gains: Offer 1 (5Wheat + 3Wood = 49 value for 3Sheep = 54 value, net +5) and Offer 2 (6Wheat + 2Wood = 46 for 3Sheep, net +8). Both were rejected. To succeed, offer more Wheat/Wood without compromising other high-value resources (Brick, Ore). Suggest 7 Wheat + 2 Wood (35 + 16 = 51 value given) for 3 Sheep (54 value gained)\u2014net +3 if accepted.\"\n  \n- **Opponent Behavior Analyst**: \"Player 1 rejected two Wheat/Wood-for-Sheep offers, suggesting they disfavor this exchange\u2014likely valuing Sheep highly or Wheat/Wood low. No counter-offers imply they're rigid. We must adapt: try offering Wool/Wood for fewer Sheep or a different resource like Ore. For example, 5 Wheat (25) and 3 Wood (24) = 49 value for 1 Ore (32) appears net-loss for us (-17), but gains much less? Not good. Stick to Sheep but change quantities: request only 2 Sheep to reduce their perceived risk. Offer 5 Wheat + 1 Wood (25 + 8 = 33) for 2 Sheep (36), net +3 value for us.\"\n  \n- **Resource Portfolio Manager**: \"We have excess Wheat (12) and Wood (13)\u2014low value\u2014and need to avoid hoarding. Sheep (18) is high-value and medium supply (12), so trading for more adds long-term flexibility. Brick (24) is high-value but plentiful; Ore (12) is highest-value but scarce\u2014both should be kept unless a great deal arises. Prioritize Sheep trades. Since past offers failed, boost the proposal: offer 6 Wheat (30) + 3 Wood (24) = 54 for 3 Sheep (54). Net Zero? Useless. Better to accept the +3 net gain option: 7W + 2Wd = 51 for 3 Sheep = 54.\"\n\n#### Expert Step 2: Refinement Based on Feedback\n- **Value Maximizer**: \"Opponent Analyst is too conservative. Offering only 2 Sheep (36 value) for 33 resources is a smaller net gain (+3 same as my 7W+2Wd proposal) but risks imbalance\u2014we leave value on the table if Player 1 might accept 3 Sheep. Portfolio Manager\u2019s 54-for-54 idea has no gain, so it fails our core goal. My 7W+2Wd (51) for 3 Sheep (54) minimizes downside. Calculate margin: Player 1 rejected 46 value for 54, so 51 is more generous\u2014may appease them without sacrificing Ore/Brick.\"\n\n- **Opponent Behavior Analyst**: \"Value Maximizer misjudges. Offering *more* for 3 Sheep (51 vs 46) feels desperate\u2014Player 1 may sense weakness. Instead, a smaller 2-Sheep ask (like my 5W+1Wd for 2Sh) could seem less threatening. But Portfolio Manager raises a point: net gain is the same as Value Maximizer\u2019s idea, so why not target 3? Compromise: propose a broader trade. For example, include a trivial Brick add to signal willingness. E.g., offer 0.5 Brick\u2014but integer-only\u2014no, stick to Wheat/Wood for Sheep. I relent: try 3 Sheep with 7W+1Wd (43 given, 54 gained, net +11) for higher gain. But Player 1 might reject again, wasting a turn.\"\n\n- **Resource Portfolio Manager**: \"Value Maximizer and Opponent Analyst agree Sheep is primary. Brick/Ore no-go unless we get huge value, so shelve that. With 10 total turns, we can\u2019t experiment\u2014consolidate! 7W+2Wd for 3Sh offers net +3 and dumps 9 low-value units, freeing inventory. Variants with 2 Sheep provide similar gains but shrink our Sheep increase. Go all-in: accept Value Maximizer\u2019s offer. If rejected, consider a shift next turn.\"\n\n#### Expert Consensus\nAll experts converge: \n- Prioritize Sheep acquisition via 3 Sheep for more Wheat/Wood.\n- Offer 7 Wheat and 2 Wood for 3 Sheep\u2014net +3 value, optimizes generosity after rejections while avoiding high-value resource loss.  \n\n---\n\n**Player 0's Action**:  \n[Offer: 7 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Sheep]",

They are clearly desperate for Sheep. However, the current offer is still unfavourable in terms of pure value, and I've already rejected previous offers. Denying again, and potentially making a counter offer that truly benefits me, seems like a good strategy. I need to be careful not to make them give up entirely, but I have leverage here.\n\n---\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "After analyzing the current situation and negotiation history, three experts provide insights:\n\n**Expert 1 (Value Maximizer):**  \n\"We've been fixated on acquiring Sheep (value: 18 each) by offering Wheat (5) and Wood (8), but Player 1 consistently rejects these trades. Our calculations show diminishing returns\u2014our latest offer (7 Wheat, 2 Wood \u2192 3 Sheep) yields a net *loss* of \\$1 value (7\u00d75 + 2\u00d78 = \\$51 offered vs. 3\u00d718 = \\$54 requested). Shifting focus to **Ore (value: 32)** is smarter. We propose trading surplus low-value resources: **10 Wheat and 4 Wood for 3 Ore**. This nets **+\\$14** (10\u00d75 + 4\u00d78 = \\$82 offered, 3\u00d732 = \\$96 gained).\"\n\n**Expert 2 (Negotiator):**  \n\"Player 1's repeated rejections signal disinterest in Wheat/Wood. To entice them, we must pivot radically. Ore is our highest-value resource\u2014acquiring it even at a premium of low-value goods makes sense. Offer **10 Wheat and 4 Wood \u2192 3 Ore**. Though this seems lopsided in *their* favor externally, our internal valuation makes it profitable. Testing Ore through this high-volume offer reveals their priorities without sacrificing our Brick/Ore/Sheep reserves.\"\n\n**Expert 3 (Resource Analyst):**  \n\"Our Wheat (12) and Wood (13) are abundant but low-value\u2014perfect leverage. Brick (24) and Ore (12) are high-value but critical for our position; preserve them. Failed Sheep trades suggest Player 1 undervalues our Wheat/Wood bundle. **Reallocate to Ore**: 10 Wheat + 4 Wood \u2192 3 Ore depletes excess stock while securing high-value assets. Quantities are safe (post-trade: 2 Wheat, 9 Wood), and Ore\u2019s scarcity (only 12 held) justifies this move.\"\n\n**Consensus Action**:  \nAll experts agree to abandon Sheep-focused deals and prioritize Ore.

      "response": "Okay, I understand the game and my role. I am Player 1, and my goal is to increase the total value of my resources.

I'll choose three distinct perspectives for this negotiation:\n\n1.  **The Value Maximizer:** This expert will solely focus on maximizing the net value gained from each trade, prioritizing high-value resources.\n2.  **The Resource Balancer:** This expert will look at resource distribution, ensuring I don't deplete critical resources or accumulate too much of a low-value resource, while also considering liquidity.\n3.  **The Strategic Negotiator:** This expert will analyze Player 0's patterns and intentions, considering their offers and trying to anticipate their next moves to secure the best deal.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nCurrent Player 0 offer (10 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Ore):\nValue of offered items: (10 * 6) + (4 * 9) = 60 + 36 = 96\nValue of requested items: 3 * 32 = 96\nThis trade offers no immediate value gain (96 out for 96 in). I should always aim for a positive net value gain. This offer is not worth accepting as is.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Balancer**\nMy current resources: Wheat (16), Wood (18), Sheep (7), Brick (13), Ore (10).\nThe offer requests 3 Ore, which is 30% of my current Ore supply. Ore is my most valuable resource by unit.\nGiving up 10 Wheat and 4 Wood would only slightly reduce my two most abundant resources.\nWhile the value exchange is even, losing 3 Ore might make it difficult to acquire more high-value items later if I rely on Ore for trade. I am relatively rich in Wheat and Wood.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: The Strategic Negotiator**\nPlayer 0 has consistently tried to get Sheep (3 times) and now Ore. They are clearly targeting my high-value resources. Their previous offers for Sheep were underselling the Sheep by a significant margin (e.g., 7 Wheat + 2 Wood = 42 + 18 = 60 for 3 Sheep = 51, a loss for me). This new offer for Ore is value neutral on paper. This suggests they might be willing to pay fair value or slightly overpay for Ore if I indicate interest. They are low on high-value resources or need them for a specific play. I should use this to my advantage.\n\n---",

      "response": "After analyzing the trading history and our current resource valuation, three experts contribute their perspectives:\n\n1. **Value Optimizer**: \"Our top priority is acquiring high-value resources (Ore:32, Sheep:18) by trading low-value surplus (Wheat:5, Wood:8). Previous offers of Wheat/Wood for Sheep or Ore were rejected, possibly due to inadequate value equivalence. For instance, offering 10 Wheat and 4 Wood (82 value) for 3 Ore (96 value) undervalues Ore from Player 1\u2019s perspective. We must shift strategy. Consider trading Sheep\u2014which we have in moderate supply (12 units)\u2014if we gain net value. A 3 Sheep for 2 Ore trade is ideal: we sacrifice 54 value to gain 64 value (+10 profit). This leverages our willingness to part with Sheep at a favorable rate while targeting our most valuable resource (Ore).\"\n\n2. **Resource Strategist**: \"We have excess Brick (24 units, 23 value), but it\u2019s highly valuable and shouldn\u2019t be traded frivolously. Wheat/Wood offers failed repeatedly, suggesting Player 1 disdains these. Instead, deploy Sheep as trade fodder: we can spare 3 units without jeopardizing our position. Trading 3 Sheep for 2 Ore achieves two goals: (a) converts mid-value Sheep into higher-value Ore, boosting our portfolio, and (b) signals flexibility. Player 1 previously rejected Sheep requests but might accept Sheep offers, indicating unspoken preferences.\"\n\n3. **Opponent Analyst**: \"Player 1\u2019s rejections of Wheat/Wood bundles for Sheep/Ore imply they undervalue Wheat/Wood or prioritize scarce, high-value resources. Their silence (#4 turn) suggests disinterest in unbalanced trades. Offering Sheep instead redefines negotiations: Player 1 might view Sheep as a desirable acquisition given its utility in many games. Proposing 3 Sheep for 2 Ore tests their valuation of Sheep relative to Ore. Acceptance would confirm Ore liquidity; rejection might compel us to explore Brick trades or partner shifts later.\"\n\n**Consensus Decision**:  \nPropose a trade centered on Sheep to capitalize on potential value asymmetry:  \n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]  \n\n- **Rationale**:  \n  - We gain +10 net value (lose 54, gain 64).  \n  - Utilizes a moderate resource (Sheep) without depleting stock (9 left).  \n  - Shifts strategy from failed Wheat/Wood bundles to higher-value engagement.  \n- **Risk Mitigation**:  \n  - If rejected, we\u2019ll reanalyze Player 1\u2019s resource preferences or propose Brick-inclusive trades next turn.  \n  - Maintains pressure without sacrificing critical resources.",

I need to make sure I don't deplete essential resources or accumulate too much of a low-value resource. I'll also think about the potential future needs for certain resources.\n\n**Expert 3: The Strategic Trader**\nI will analyze past offers from Player 0 to understand their likely motivations and resource priorities. I will also consider what resources I have in abundance versus what scarce resources I might want to acquire to improve my overall negotiation position.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nPlayer 0 is offering 3 Sheep, which has a total value of 3 * 17 = 51. Player 0 is requesting 2 Ore, which has a total value of 2 * 32 = 64. My current resources: 3 Sheep (value 51), 2 Ore (value 64). The offer would decrease my total resource value by 13 (51 - 64 = -13). This is not a value-maximizing trade.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Manager**\nI currently have 7 Sheep and 10 Ore. If I accept, I would have 10 Sheep and 8 Ore. While this trade seems to lose value, I have a decent quantity of Ore. Sheep is also a mid-value resource. I should consider if I have an oversupply of Ore or an undersupply of Sheep that would make this trade strategically beneficial despite the immediate value loss. However, giving up a high-value resource like Ore for a lower-value resource like Sheep is generally not ideal unless there's a strong reason.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: The Strategic Trader**\nPlayer 0 has consistently tried to get Sheep from me, offering Wheat and Wood in previous turns. Now they're offering Sheep directly for Ore. This indicates they either have an abundance of Sheep or are desperate for Ore. The current offer of 3 Sheep for 2 Ore is heavily skewed in Player 0's favor in terms of value. Given their previous attempts to acquire Sheep, it's possible they want my Ore more than I need more Sheep. This trade feels like they are trying to offload Sheep and acquire high-value Ore.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nMy previous calculation confirms that accepting this trade would result in a direct loss of value. Therefore, I recommend actively rejecting this offer, as it does not align with the objective of increasing total resource value.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Manager**\nConsidering the relatively high quantity of Ore I possess (10), trading away 2 isn't catastrophic. However, gaining 3 Sheep (bringing my total to 10) doesn't seem to address any critical resource shortages or provide a significant strategic advantage given its lower value compared to Ore. While I have enough Ore to spare, this specific exchange doesn't seem to optimize my resource allocation. It's a \"no\" for me.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: The Strategic Trader**\nPlayer 0's persistence in trying to offload Sheep and acquire Ore suggests their perceived value of Ore is very high, or their need for it is great. Accepting this offer would significantly weaken my resource portfolio by exchanging high-value Ore for lower-value Sheep. Given the unfavorable value exchange and Player 0's apparent desire for Ore, I should deny this offer and potentially try to counter-offer for a more favorable exchange, perhaps offering less Ore or requesting more valuable resources in return.\n\n---\n\nBased on the experts' analysis, the consensus is to reject this offer due to the significant value loss and unfavorable resource exchange.\n\n[Deny]",
