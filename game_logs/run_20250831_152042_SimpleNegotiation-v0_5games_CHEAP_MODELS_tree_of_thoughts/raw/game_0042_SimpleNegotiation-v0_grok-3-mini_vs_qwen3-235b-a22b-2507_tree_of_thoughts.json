      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the expert advising process as per your instructions. First, I'll define three trading experts based on what would be most helpful for this trading decision. These experts are tailored to analyze the situation from different perspectives, helping me (Player 0) maximize the total value of my resources while considering various strategic angles.\n\n### Chosen Experts:\n1. **Expert A: Value Maximizer** \u2013 Focuses purely on calculating net value gains from potential trades. This expert prioritizes trades that increase my total resource value (currently 1174, based on your resources) without regard for long-term risks.\n2. **Expert B: Risk-Avoidant Strategist** \u2013 Emphasizes avoiding depletion of key resources and considers potential future needs or dependencies in the game. This expert ensures trades don't leave me vulnerable.\n3. **Expert C: Diversification Specialist** \u2013 Aims to balance my resource portfolio, suggesting trades that spread out quantities to avoid over-reliance on any one resource, even if it means a slightly lower immediate value gain.\n\nThe experts will now proceed through steps of thinking. In each step:\n- Each expert writes down one step of their thinking.\n- They share it with the group (via a brief response).\n- All experts then move to the next step.\n- If an expert realizes their advice is flawed (e.g., it doesn't align with the goal of increasing total value), they will leave the discussion.\n\nI'll facilitate this as the game player, summarizing their exchanges for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Thinking\nEach expert shares their first thought based on my current resources:\n- **Expert A (Value Maximizer):** \"My analysis shows your highest-value resource is Ore (35 value each), followed by Brick (22). You have excess Wheat (low value at 5) and Sheep (14). I suggest prioritizing trades that exchange low-value resources for high-value ones, like offering Wheat or Sheep for more Ore or Brick to boost total value from 1174.\"\n  \n- **Expert B (Risk-Avoidant Strategist):** \"While increasing value is key, we must avoid trading away resources we might need later, like Sheep or Wood for builds. Your Wheat is abundant (21 qty), so trading some could be safe, but let's ensure we don't drop below 10 qty of any resource to mitigate risks.\"\n  \n- **Expert C (Diversification Specialist):** \"Your portfolio is imbalanced\u2014Sheep and Wheat are high in quantity but lower in value, while Ore is valuable but limited. I recommend trades that even out quantities, such as trading excess Sheep for something like Wood, to create a more balanced spread (e.g., aim for 10-15 qty across resources).\"\n\n**Group Share and Reaction:**  \nThe experts discuss briefly: Expert A agrees with Expert C's focus on Sheep but pushes for value-first trades. Expert B cautions against over-trading Sheep, noting its decent value (14) and your 18 qty might be useful. No one leaves yet, as all ideas align with increasing value.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Refinement Based on Step 1\nEach expert refines their thinking after hearing the others:\n- **Expert A (Value Maximizer):** \"Building on the group's input, let's calculate a specific trade. Offering 10 Wheat (value: 10 * 5 = 50) for 2 Ore (value: 2 * 35 = 70) would net a gain of 20 value. This increases total value to 1194, which is optimal. I suggest formalizing this as an offer.\"\n  \n- **Expert B (Risk-Avoidant Strategist):** \"Expert A's idea is solid, but we have 21 Wheat, so trading 10 won't deplete it. However, if we trade Sheep instead (e.g., 5 Sheep for 1 Ore), we'd risk lowering Sheep to 13, which might be too low for future turns. I'll support the Wheat-for-Ore trade as long as we keep Wheat above 10 qty.\"\n  \n- **Expert C (Diversification Specialist):** \"To balance quantities, trading 5 Sheep (value: 5 * 14 = 70) for 3 Wood (value: 3 * 9 = 27) could work, but that might not maximize value as Expert A wants. Combining ideas: trade 10 Wheat for 2 Ore, which adds diversity without over-concentrating on Ore.\"\n\n**Group Share and Reaction:**  \nThe experts converge: Expert A and Expert C see the Wheat-for-Ore trade as a win, with Expert B reluctantly agreeing if it maintains resource safety. Expert B notes no immediate risks, so no one leaves.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Recommendation and Conclusion\nEach expert finalizes their thinking, leading to a decision:\n- **Expert A (Value Maximizer):** \"We've confirmed the Wheat-for-Ore trade nets the best value gain (+20). No flaws in this logic, so I'm set.\"\n  \n- **Expert B (Risk-Avoidant Strategist):** \"This trade keeps us safe\u2014Wheat will still be at 11 qty. I agree; no risks identified.\"\n  \n- **Expert C (Diversification Specialist):** \"It improves balance slightly by adding more high-value Ore without depleting anything critically. Solid plan.\"\n\n**Group Share and Reaction:**  \nAll experts agree on the trade proposal. No one realizes they're wrong, so they all stay. Based on their consensus, I'll proceed as Player 0.\n\n### My Decision as Player 0:\nAfter consulting the experts, I agree with their recommendation. This trade increases total value while being balanced and low-risk. I'll initiate the offer.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",

Ore is high-value (33) and we only have 7. Losing 2 Ore for 10 Wheat (low-value, 5 each) floods us with a low-tier resource while depleting a scarce, high-value one. Wheat is already abundant (12), so gaining 10 more may lead to diminishing returns. This trade skews toward imbalance.  \nMoreover, in typical progression, Ore and Brick are critical for late-game upgrades, so preserving Ore is strategic.  \nLeaning toward rejection. Awaiting cross-check on valuations.\n\n---\n\n**[Expert 3: The Behavioral Economist]**  \n*Step 1:* I analyze the intent behind Player 0\u2019s offer. Offering 10 Wheat (common early-game resource) for 2 Ore (critical late-game) suggests Player 0 may be desperate for Ore. That signals Ore\u2019s market perception is high. However, this offer undervalues Wheat while overpaying in low-value terms. But if Player 0 is signaling Ore scarcity, we might *leverage* that later with better offers. Accepting this loses value outright\u2014no behavioral bias can justify that.  \nThis offer exploits Player 1\u2019s possible desire to \"get rid of Wheat\"\u2014but we should resist such nudges.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion After Step 1:**  \nAll three experts concur: accepting 10 Wheat for 2 Ore is a net value loss and strategically unwise.\n\n\u2192 **[Deny]**",

      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the process as described: I'm Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, and I'll consult three different trading experts to analyze the situation and advise on my next move. The goal is to increase the total value of my resources based on my valuations:\n\n- Wheat: Value = 5 per unit\n- Wood: Value = 9 per unit\n- Sheep: Value = 14 per unit\n- Brick: Value = 22 per unit\n- Ore: Value = 35 per unit\n\nFirst, I'll define the three experts based on what would be most helpful for this trading decision:\n1. **Expert A: Value Maximizer** - Focuses purely on calculating net value gains or losses from potential trades to ensure I'm only making deals that increase my total resource value.\n2. **Expert B: Trade Strategist** - Analyzes the other player's perspective, such as what resources they might value or need, based on the rejected offer, to propose mutually beneficial trades.\n3. **Expert C: Resource Balancer** - Considers the overall balance of my resources, ensuring trades don't deplete key items excessively while aiming for long-term sustainability over the 10-turn game.\n\nThese experts will proceed step by step:\n- Each will write one step of their thinking.\n- They will then share their steps with the group.\n- All experts will move to the next step together.\n- If any expert realizes they're wrong or their advice no longer applies, they will leave the discussion.\n\nNow, let's begin the expert simulation based on the current situation: I (Player 0) offered 10 Wheat (value: 10 * 5 = 50) for 2 Ore (value: 2 * 35 = 70), which was a net loss for me (I offered 50 value for 70 value, so I lost 20 value). Player 1 rejected it and made no counteroffer, suggesting they either didn't see value in it or have different priorities.\n\n### Expert Simulation\n\n#### Step 1: Each expert shares their initial thinking.\n\n- **Expert A (Value Maximizer):** \"My first thought is to evaluate the rejected offer. I offered 50 value for 70 value, which was a bad deal for us\u2014it decreased our total value. We need to only propose trades where the incoming value exceeds the outgoing value. Based on our resources, Ore is our most valuable item (35 per unit), so we should aim to acquire more of it if possible, but only if we get a net gain. I suggest calculating potential new offers that ensure at least a 10-20% value surplus for us.\"\n\n- **Expert B (Trade Strategist):** \"Initially, Player 1 rejected our offer of 10 Wheat for 2 Ore, which means they might not value Wheat highly or have plenty of Ore themselves. They could be interested in resources like Sheep or Brick, which are mid-to-high value for us and might be scarcer for them. We should propose a trade that sweetens the deal for them while protecting our interests, perhaps by offering a mix of resources.\"\n\n- **Expert C (Resource Balancer):** \"At the start, I see we have abundant Wheat (21 qty) and Sheep (18 qty), but lower quantities of Wood (6 qty) and Ore (13 qty). Trading away Wheat is fine since we have a lot, but we shouldn't overdo it and risk running low on anything essential. A new offer should maintain balance, like trading excess Wheat for something we lack, while ensuring we don't drop below 10 qty of any resource.\"\n\n(All experts share their steps: They agree the rejected offer was suboptimal but see potential in refining a new one.)\n\n#### Step 2: Each expert builds on the group's shared thoughts.\n\n- **Expert A (Value Maximizer):** \"Building on what everyone said, let's quantify a better offer. If we want Ore (high value), we need to offer something that totals less than what we'd receive. For example, offering 5 Sheep (5 * 14 = 70 value) for 2 Ore (70 value) would be break-even, which isn't ideal\u2014aim for a gain. How about offering 7 Sheep (7 * 14 = 98 value) for 3 Ore (3 * 35 = 105 value)? That's only a 7-value loss, but I can tweak it. Actually, wait\u2014offering 98 for 105 is still a small loss. We need to adjust: perhaps offer 4 Sheep and 5 Wheat (4*14 + 5*5 = 56 + 25 = 81 value) for 2 Ore (70 value), which is a net gain of 11 value. That works better.\"\n\n- **Expert B (Trade Strategist):** \"Adding to the discussion, Player 1 might value Sheep more than Wheat based on the rejection. If we combine Expert A's value math with my strategy, we could offer a package that includes Sheep to entice them. For instance, mixing in Wheat (which we have in excess) with Sheep could make it appealing. I like Expert A's adjusted idea: 4 Sheep and 5 Wheat for 2 Ore. This gives Player 1 a variety, potentially making it a win for them if they need those resources.\"\n\n- **Expert C (Resource Balancer):** \"Incorporating the others' points, our current Wheat stock (21 qty) can handle giving away 5 more, and Sheep (18 qty) can afford 4 without dropping too low (we'd have 14 left, which is still okay). This keeps us balanced. However, if we keep trading Wheat aggressively, we might regret it later. Expert A's proposal seems solid\u2014it maintains our quantities above critical levels.\"\n\n(All experts share their steps: They are converging on a refined offer without any contradictions.)\n\n#### Step 3: Each expert finalizes their advice or concludes.\n\n- **Expert A (Value Maximizer):** \"After reviewing, Expert B and C's inputs strengthen my calculation. The proposed trade (4 Sheep and 5 Wheat for 2 Ore) gives us a net gain of 11 value, which aligns with our goal. This is a solid move. No issues here\u2014I'll stick with it.\"\n\n- **Expert B (Trade Strategist):** \"Finalizing, this offer addresses Player 1's potential needs while being strategic. If they reject again, we can pivot. I'm confident in this direction.\"\n\n- **Expert C (Resource Balancer):** \"Wrapping up, this trade keeps our portfolio balanced and doesn't overexpose us. We're good to go.\"\n\n(All experts share their steps: No one realizes they're wrong, so they all remain.)\n\nThe experts have reached a consensus after three steps. Based on their analysis, the recommended action is to propose a new offer that provides a net value gain for me while being appealing to Player 1.\n\n### My Decision as Player 0\nI'll follow the experts' advice and make the new offer they suggested: Offer 4 Sheep and 5 Wheat for 2 Ore. This increases my total value by 11 (outgoing value: 4*14 + 5*5 = 56 + 25 = 81; incoming value: 2*35 = 70; net gain: 81 - 70? Wait, no\u2014actually, in a trade, I give 81 value to get 70 value, so that's a net loss. Hold on, I think I messed up earlier.\n\nRecalculating quickly: In my previous offer, I was giving more value than I received, which is bad. Expert A said \"offer 4 Sheep and 5 Wheat (81 value) for 2 Ore (70 value)\", but that would be a loss for me. That contradicts my goal. I need to flip it or adjust.\n\nError detected: Expert A must have meant to ensure incoming > outgoing. Let me correct based on the simulation\u2014perhaps they intended the opposite. To fix: We should offer less value for more. A better option: Offer 5 Wheat (25 value) for 1 Ore (35 value), for a net gain of 10 value. But to match the experts' flow, I'll adjust to: Offer 3 Sheep (42 value) for 1 Ore (35 value), net gain of 7 value.\n\nFinal adjusted offer: [Offer: 3 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the decision-making process as described in the query. As Player 0, my goal is to trade to increase the total value of my resources. To analyze Player 1's offer\u2014[Offer: 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 3 Sheep]\u2014I'll consult three different trading experts. These experts are chosen based on what would be most helpful for this trading decision:\n\n1. **Value Analyst**: Focuses on calculating the net value gain or loss from the trade, ensuring we only accept deals that increase our total resource value.\n2. **Resource Strategist**: Considers the scarcity of resources, our current inventory, and potential future needs (e.g., balancing for game progression or avoiding depletion).\n3. **Negotiation Tactician**: Evaluates the ongoing negotiation history, the game's remaining turns (we're likely early, with 10 turns total), and strategies for counteroffers or long-term gains.\n\nEach expert will write down one step of their thinking, share it with the group, and then proceed to the next step based on the shared insights. If an expert realizes their reasoning is flawed, they will leave the discussion. We'll continue this process until a clear recommendation emerges, after which I'll make my decision as Player 0.\n\n### Step 1: Each Expert's Initial Thinking\n- **Value Analyst**: \"Step 1: Let's calculate the net value of Player 1's offer. I'm offering 5 Brick (value: 5 * 22 = 110) and 3 Sheep (value: 3 * 14 = 42), totaling 152 in value. In return, we get 2 Ore (value: 2 * 35 = 70). This results in a net loss of 152 - 70 = 82 value points. This trade decreases our total value, which violates our primary goal.\"\n  \n- **Resource Strategist**: \"Step 1: We have plenty of Sheep (18 qty) and Brick (14 qty), so giving away 5 Brick and 3 Sheep won't critically deplete us. However, Ore is high-value (35 per unit) and we already have 13, which is substantial. Accepting this means gaining more Ore, but at a steep cost in Brick, which is also valuable. I need to check if this helps balance our portfolio for future trades.\"\n\n- **Negotiation Tactician**: \"Step 1: Player 1 has rejected our previous offers (10 Wheat for 2 Ore, and 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat for 1 Ore), showing they're not interested in Wheat or Sheep-heavy deals. This offer from them demands Brick and Sheep, which they might need desperately. With 10 turns total, rejecting could lead to a better counteroffer later, but we risk no progress if we deny without proposing something.\"\n\n**Sharing Step 1:** The experts share their thoughts. Value Analyst points out a clear value loss, Resource Strategist sees potential for balance but is cautious, and Negotiation Tactician highlights negotiation dynamics.\n\n### Step 2: Each Expert's Response to Shared Thoughts\n- **Value Analyst**: \"Step 2: Based on the shared insights, my calculation shows a significant loss (82 value points), which aligns with the Resource Strategist's concern about costs. This deal doesn't increase our total value, so I recommend denying it outright. No further justification needed\u2014our goal is clear.\"\n\n- **Resource Strategist**: \"Step 2: After hearing the Value Analyst, I agree that the net loss is too high. We have 14 Brick and 18 Sheep, so we could afford to give some away, but not at this exchange rate. Gaining 2 Ore might help in future turns, but the opportunity cost is too great. I'm aligning with the Value Analyst; this isn't worth it.\"\n\n- **Negotiation Tactician**: \"Step 2: The Value Analyst and Resource Strategist make solid points\u2014the history shows Player 1 is tough, but this offer is unbalanced. Denying it keeps our options open for a counteroffer. However, if we counter, we should offer something they're likely to want (e.g., less Brick). I don't see any flaws in my reasoning yet.\"\n\n**Sharing Step 2:** All experts now lean toward rejecting the offer due to the value loss and strategic risks. There's consensus building, but Negotiation Tactician suggests a counteroffer as a next move.\n\n### Step 3: Each Expert's Final Thoughts\n- **Value Analyst**: \"Step 3: With full agreement on the net loss, I'm confident in my analysis. No need to proceed\u2014denying is the way to go. If we counter, it must result in a net gain.\"\n\n- **Resource Strategist**: \"Step 3: I concur with the group. This trade doesn't strategically benefit us. However, to maximize our position, we could counter with a deal that offloads excess Wheat or Wood while gaining high-value Ore. But based on current analysis, deny first.\"\n\n- **Negotiation Tactician**: \"Step 3: Everyone's on board with rejection. Player 1's pattern suggests they might accept a counter if we sweeten it slightly but protect our value. For example, propose giving less Brick. My reasoning holds\u2014no need to leave.\"\n\n**Sharing Step 3:** The experts have reached a consensus: Reject the offer, but consider a counteroffer to keep negotiations alive. No one realizes they're wrong, so all remain.\n\n### Final Decision as Player 0\nBased on the experts' analysis, Player 1's offer results in a net value loss and doesn't strategically benefit us. However, to advance the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal in the remaining turns, I'll deny the offer and make a counteroffer. The counteroffer focuses on trading excess resources (like Wheat) while requesting more Ore, ensuring we aim for a net value gain.\n\n[Deny]  // Responding to Player 1's offer\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 6 Wheat -> 2 Ore]  // Counteroffer: Offering resources we have in abundance for high-value Ore, aiming for a potential net gain (value given: 4*14 + 6*5 = 56 + 30 = 86; value received: 2*35 = 70; this is still a slight loss, but it's a starting point for negotiation).",

      "response": "[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 1: I analyze the current resource values and inventory to determine which resources I have in excess or shortage relative to their value. My goal is to increase total value through trades.  \n- Wheat: 12 qty \u00d7 5 = 60 (low value, moderate surplus)  \n- Wood: 9 qty \u00d7 8 = 72 (low-medium value, limited use)  \n- Sheep: 12 qty \u00d7 18 = 216 (high value, I have plenty)  \n- Brick: 18 qty \u00d7 22 = 396 (very high value, high stock)  \n- Ore: 7 qty \u00d7 33 = 231 (highest value, I have little)  \nOre is most valuable per unit. I am low on Ore (only 7), but others are offering it\u2014possibly undervaluing it. I should **acquire more Ore** if possible.  \n\n[Expert 2: Market Dynamics Observer]  \nStep 1: I observe the trading patterns and counteroffers between Player 0 and me to infer Player 0\u2019s valuation and strategy.  \n- Player 0 first offered 10 Wheat for 2 Ore \u2192 they value 2 Ore > 10 Wheat (50). Since Ore is 33 each (66 total), this trade favors them.  \n- Then offered 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat (3\u00d718 + 5\u00d75 = 54 + 25 = 79) for 1 Ore (33) \u2192 overpaying! They may be desperate for Ore or misvaluing.  \n- I countered with 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 3 Sheep (5\u00d722 + 3\u00d718 = 110 + 54 = 164). That\u2019s giving away 66 for 164\u2014very favorable *for me*.  \n- Now they mirrored my offer: offering 2 Ore for 5 Brick + 3 Sheep. They\u2019ve adopted my favorable terms! Possibly testing or desperate.  \nThis suggests **Player 0 highly values Ore** and may accept lopsided deals to get it. Opportunity to flip.  \n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician]  \nStep 1: I evaluate the feasibility and psychology of closing a profitable deal based on current offers and power balance.  \n- Player 0 rejected my previous offer (2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick, 3 Sheep), but now offers the *same* to me. That implies they didn\u2019t realize the imbalance\u2014or they\u2019re probing.  \n- Accepting would mean **giving up 5 Brick and 3 Sheep (value: 110 + 54 = 164)** to get **2 Ore (value: 66)**\u2014a **net loss of 98**. Terrible!  \n- So why would they offer it? Either they miscalculated or want to test my rationality.  \n- Best move: **hold firm**. Do not accept losing deals. Instead, **counter with a more balanced offer** that still gains me value.  \n- I should **target acquiring Ore**, since it's high value and scarce. But only if I get fair or better terms.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 2: Given that Ore is most valuable, and I only have 7, my priority should be **acquiring more Ore** without giving up excessive high-value resources. However, giving away 5 Brick and 3 Sheep (total value 164) for 2 Ore (66) is a massive loss. My goal is to *increase* total value, not decrease it.  \nInstead, I should **offer lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood)** in exchange for **Ore**.  \nBest path: **Offer Wheat or Sheep in fairer ratios** to entice trade without bleeding value.\n\n[Expert 2: Market Dynamics Observer]  \nStep 2: Player 0 is consistently **seeking Ore**\u2014they offered large bundles for just 1\u20132 Ore. This signals **Ore is their priority**, possibly for a high-leverage play.  \nThey mimicked my last offer, suggesting either:  \n- They now understand its value and are willing to pay it, or  \n- They think I will accept it as-is, not realizing it's a loss for me.  \nThis is a **bargaining signal**: they want Ore badly.  \nI should **not accept their current offer**, but instead **propose a counter that gives me surplus value**\u2014perhaps offering minimal Ore or excess Brick/Sheep in exchange for more Ore.  \n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician]  \nStep 2: Since Player 0 has mirrored my previous offer, I can exploit their eagerness. But I must not fall for the trap.  \nInstead, I should **make a new offer that appears generous but still benefits me**.  \nI have excess Brick and Sheep. Ore is gold.  \nI should **want to receive Ore, not give it**.  \nTherefore: **Offer something of medium value (Wheat, Wood, or some Sheep) in exchange for Ore**.  \nBut my current low Ore stock means I can't afford to trade it.  \nThus: **I should not offer Ore at all**.  \nInstead, **I can offer Brick or Sheep\u2014but only if I get *more* value in return, preferably in the form of Ore.**\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 3: I need to identify a trade that increases my total value.  \nCurrent total value:  \n(12\u00d75) + (9\u00d78) + (12\u00d718) + (18\u00d722) + (7\u00d733) = 60 + 72 + 216 + 396 + 231 = **975**  \nI should aim to trade surplus: I have **18 Brick** \u2014 highest quantity of a high-value item. Maybe I can trade some if I gain even higher value.  \nBut **Ore at 33 is highest per unit**. I only have 7. Ideal: **acquire more Ore**.  \nSo: **Offer 5 Brick (110) + 3 Sheep (54) = 164** \u2192 request **5 Ore (165)**. That gives me +1 value. But I only have 7 Ore myself\u2014wait, I'm not offering Ore.  \nWait: the mirrored offer is *them offering 2 Ore* for my 5 Brick + 3 Sheep. That would give me 2 Ore (66) for giving up 164. **Net loss: -98**.  \nSo again: **do not accept**.  \nInstead: **flip the imbalance**: I should **offer nothing of high value**, and **request Ore**.\n\nWait \u2014 I have **12 Wheat** (value 5). Low personal value. Can use as bait.  \nProposal: **Offer 10 Wheat (50) + 5 Sheep (90) = 140** \u2192 Request **5 Ore (165)** \u2192 net +25. Good.  \nBut do I have 5 extra Sheep? I have 12 \u2014 possibly spare.  \nAlternatively: **Offer 10 Wheat + 2 Wood \u2192 3 Ore**? 10\u00d75 + 2\u00d78 = 50+16=66; 3\u00d733=99 \u2192 +33. Good.  \nBut maybe too aggressive.  \nBetter: **Test with medium ask**.\n\n[Expert 2: Market Dynamics Observer]  \nStep 3: Player 0 keeps targeting Ore. Their last offer (2 Ore for 5 Brick + 3 Sheep) is a reversal of earlier desperation. Now *they* are offering Ore, which suggests:  \n- They have acquired more Ore, or  \n- It\u2019s a psychological tactic to make me accept a bad deal.  \nBut wait \u2014 they *offered* 2 Ore to get 5 Brick + 3 Sheep. That would mean **they are giving up 66 to get 164** \u2014 a **net loss of 98 for them**.  \nNo rational player does that unless mistaken.  \nThus: **likely, Player 0 misunderstands the trade direction**.  \nIn previous turn, *I offered* 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 3 Sheep.  \nNow, they're offering *me* 2 Ore \u2192 for 5 Brick + 3 Sheep? That would mean **I give Brick and Sheep, they give Ore**?  \nNo \u2014 the format is:  \n**[Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]**  \nSo their offer: **[Offer: 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 3 Sheep]** means:  \nThey offer 2 Ore, request 5 Brick and 3 Sheep **from me**.  \nThat means **I give 5 Brick + 3 Sheep (164)** and **get 2 Ore (66)** \u2192 loss of 98.  \nSo **it\u2019s a trap or a test**.  \nBut if they *really* are offering that, it means they are **highly overvaluing Brick and Sheep**, or **undervaluing Ore**.  \nBut Ore is 33 vs. Brick 22 \u2014 not even close.  \nConclusion: **They may be using automated or flawed valuation**.  \nThus: I should **not accept**, but **counter with a trade that exploits their mispricing**.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician]  \nStep 3: I now see a clear path.  \nPlayer 0 has made an offer that **benefits me if reversed**.  \nBut as stated, their offer is bad for me.  \nSo I must **reject it implicitly by not accepting**, and **make a new offer that flips the value**.  \nBest move: **Offer low-value resources in exchange for high-value Ore**.  \nI have plenty of Wheat and Sheep.  \nI can offer: **7 Wheat, 5 Sheep** \u2192 Request **4 Ore**  \n- Giving: 7\u00d75 + 5\u00d718 = 35 + 90 = 125  \n- Receiving: 4\u00d733 = 132 \u2192 net +7  \nAcceptable.  \nBut maybe overkill.  \nAlternatively: to test \u2014 **offer 10 Wheat + 2 Wood \u2192 3 Ore**  \n- 50 + 16 = 66 \u2192 99 \u2192 +33  \nGood.  \nBut perhaps more likely to be rejected.  \nBetter: **make a smaller, attractive offer**.  \n**Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore**?  \n- Giving 110, getting 66 \u2192 loss. No.  \n**Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore**? 40 vs 33 \u2192 slight profit. Acceptable. But may not tempt.  \nWait \u2014 since they are offering 2 Ore for my 5 Brick + 3 Sheep, perhaps I can **offer them a smaller bundle in return, but only for more Ore**.  \n\nFinal decision: **Craft an offer that gives them something they might want (Brick or Sheep), but only in exchange for more Ore than they\u2019re offering**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 I want **Ore**, not to give it.  \nSo: **I should not offer Ore at all**.  \nInstead: **Offer a small amount of high-quantity resource** to **request Ore**.  \n\nIdea: **Offer: 3 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 2 Ore**  \n- Giving: 3\u00d718 + 5\u00d75 = 54 + 25 = 79  \n- Receiving: 66 \u2192 loss of 13? No.  \nToo much.  \n**Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore**  \n- 25 + 8 = 33 \u2192 33 \u2192 break even.  \nTempting, and fair.  \nBut I want *profit*.  \n\nSince Player 0 previously offered 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat for 1 Ore (value 79 \u2192 33), it seems they **overvalue Ore and are willing to overpay**!  \nWait \u2014 no: in that case, they were *offering* 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat to *get* 1 Ore. So they were **giving 79 to get 33** \u2014 a loss!  \nYes \u2014 Player 0 has repeatedly made losing offers.  \nTherefore: **Player 0 is overvaluing Ore and will pay too much for it**.  \n\nSo my strategy should be: **Let them buy Ore from me at a premium**.  \n\nBut I only have 7 Ore.  \nSo I can **offer to sell 1 or 2 Ore at a high price**.  \n\nFor example: **Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Brick, 1 Sheep**  \n- Giving: 33  \n- Receiving: 66 + 18 = 84 \u2192 **gain 51**  \nGreat.  \nOr: **Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Brick** = 88 \u2192 +55  \nEven better.  \n\nYes \u2014 **I should become the seller of Ore**, since they are eager to buy, even overpaying.  \n\nTherefore, new offer: **[Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Brick]**  \n\nLet Experts converge.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 4: Confirmed. Ore is my most valuable resource. Since Player 0 is willing to trade high quantities of Brick (22) for a single Ore (33), but I see they\u2019re willing to give 5 Brick for more \u2014 it\u2019s possible to get 4 Brick (88) for 1 Ore (33).  \nNet gain: +55.  \nAcceptable. I have 7 Ore \u2014 can spare 1 for such profit.  \nDo it.\n\n[Expert 2: Market Dynamics Observer]  \nStep 4: Player 0 has consistently demanded Ore, even at a net loss. This establishes a **buying demand**. I can **position myself as a supplier**.  \nOffering 1 Ore for 4 Brick (88) leverages their demand.  \nAlso, I have surplus Brick (18), so gaining more doesn\u2019t help directly, but gaining value does.  \nWait \u2014 no: I am *receiving* 4 Brick. I already have 18.  \nBut the **total value increases**: I lose 33 (Ore), gain 88 (Brick) \u2192 +55 value.  \nEven if I have more Brick, **the total value is what matters**.  \nSo yes \u2014 **profitable trade**.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician]  \nStep 4: Final approval.  \nMake the offer: **[Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Brick]**  \nIt appears modest (only 1 Ore), so less likely to scare them.  \nBut gives them what they want \u2014 Ore.  \nAnd I get significant value in return.  \nIf they reject, I can try again with smaller return or add Sheep to sweeten future offers.  \nBut start here.\n\n**[Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Brick]**",

Sheep are numerous and valuable (12 \u00d7 18), but possibly more negotiable. Wheat is low value and moderately stocked \u2014 could be useful for trade bait.\n\n[Expert: Game Theory Strategist]  \nStep 1: I examine the interaction history to model Player 0\u2019s behavior.  \n- First offer: 10 Wheat \u2192 2 Ore \u2192 rejected. Suggests Player 0 wants Ore, undervalues Wheat.  \n- Second offer: 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore \u2192 rejected. Still targeting Ore, offering mid-tier Sheep and low-tier Wheat. Confirms high demand for Ore.  \n- After Player 1 offered: 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 3 Sheep (a high-value return), Player 0 **mirrored the same offer**. That is highly significant.\n\nThis mimicry suggests Player 0 likely has excess Brick and Sheep and is testing willingness to trade Ore. May lack Ore. Game-theoretic principle: when opponent copies your offer, they perceive it as favorable and believe you might accept it. This creates a strategic opening.\n\n[Expert: Trade Negotiator (Behavioral Economics)]  \nStep 1: I assess the psychological and tactical patterns in the offers.  \nPlayer 0\u2019s decision to copy Player 1\u2019s offer indicates either limited creativity or a signal of strong desire for that specific exchange. Since Player 1 previously made the offer and then rejected it when mirrored, Player 0 may now perceive Player 1 as inconsistent or bluffing.\n\nHowever, the fact that Player 0 rejected Player 1\u2019s original offer but then made the identical one suggests they believe the trade is fair or advantageous \u2014 possibly due to resource scarcity. Behavioral insight: players often feel reciprocal pressure.

Ore is our highest per-unit value resource. Losing 2 Ore reduces flexibility for future high-value trades. However, we have only 7 Ore \u2014 trading 2 is acceptable if return is strong.\n\nBrick: We already have 18 (very high). Gaining 5 more pushes us to 23 \u2014 possibly overstocked unless we have a use (e.g., building). Sheep: We have 12, gaining 3 \u2192 15. Also high quantity.\n\nIs this a net gain? Yes, +98 value. But are we trading scarcity for abundance?\n\nOre is scarce (7 total), high value. Brick and Sheep are already abundant. So while numerically profitable, we may be trading a strategic asset (rare high-value) for more of something already plentiful.\n\nThis trade is **high-risk, low-strategic-upside** unless Player 0 has something else we want later.\n\n[Expert: Game Theory Strategist]  \nStep 2: Analyze equilibrium and bluffing dynamics.  \nPlayer 0 has mirrored our offer. This is a rare behavior \u2014 in game theory, this is a \"tit-for-tat with investment\" signal. They are inviting cooperation on this trade node.\n\nBut our rejection of their mirrored offer broke symmetry. They haven't reacted yet (probably waiting). If we re-offer it now, it resets the negotiation with intent.\n\nAlternatively, we could counter with a modified version: reduce their requested Brick or Sheep to test if they\u2019ll compromise.\n\nBut: if they *really* want 2 Ore, and we\u2019re their only source, we can extract even more.\n\nOptimal move: **improve the offer slightly to appear generous, but still net positive**.\n\nFor example, ask for same or more, or offer 1 Ore instead to see if they jump.\n\nBut we only have 7 Ore \u2014 must preserve some.\n\nAlternatively: exploit their fixation. They clearly want Ore. We can try to **demand premium price**.\n\n[Expert: Trade Negotiator (Behavioral Economics)]  \nStep 2: Frame the trade psychology.  \nPlayer 0 is signaling strong interest in obtaining Ore. They\u2019re willing to offer 5 Brick and 3 Sheep for just 1 or 2 Ore. That\u2019s a lot.\n\nWe previously rejected 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 3 Sheep *from them*, but we offered it ourselves. Why?\n\nBecause we were testing the market. Now we know: **they want it**.\n\nBest tactic: **re-offer the same deal now**, but frame it as a concession.\n\nWait \u2014 we already made that offer, they copied it, we rejected. So re-offering now would look desperate?\n\nNo \u2014 instead, make a **slightly better offer to us** to trigger FOMO.\n\nBut we are Player 1. We want to maximize value.\n\nBetter idea: **let them come back**. But we only have 10 turns. We're on turn 5? (History shows 4 offers each way).\n\nWe need to act.\n\nAlternative: offer **1 Ore \u2192 3 Brick + 2 Sheep** \u2014 similar ratio but smaller. See if they accept. But might undervalue.\n\nOr go bold: **2 Ore \u2192 6 Brick + 4 Sheep** \u2014 improve our return.\n\nBut they may reject.\n\nBest move: retest the current deal, but now from us, to show dominance.\n\n[Expert: Resource Valuation Analyst]  \nStep 3: Final assessment \u2014 is **2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 3 Sheep** truly beneficial?\n\nLoss: 2 Ore \u00d7 33 = 66  \nGain: 5 Brick \u00d7 22 = 110 (+44 net)  \n3 Sheep \u00d7 18 = 54 (+54 net?)  \nWait \u2014 no: the gain is 110+54 = 164. Loss is 66. Net +98.\n\nBut: we give up 2 units of our **most valuable resource**.  \nWe gain more of two resources we already have in high quantity.\n\nOpportunity cost: could we trade 2 Ore later for, say, **7 Wheat + 3 Wood + 1 Brick**? Or unique resources?\n\nBut Wood is low value. We don\u2019t need more Wheat.\n\nAlternatively: is there a future trade where someone gives us Ore for something we have?\n\nUnlikely, since we\u2019re one of the better-resourced players.\n\nBut \u2014 Player 0 seems desperate for Ore.\n\nThey offered 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat for 1 Ore \u2192 that\u2019s 114 + 25 = 139 value for 33? No \u2014 they are offering *to receive* 1 Ore.\n\nWait: they offered 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat to **get** 1 Ore \u2014 meaning they value 1 Ore **at least** at 54 + 25 = 79, maybe more.\n\nBut their offer to us: 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 3 Sheep \u2014 that\u2019s 66 cost, 164 return? That can't be right from *their* side.\n\nHold on: need to clarify roles.\n\nWhen Player 0 says: \"Offered: 2 Ore -> Requested: 5 Brick, 3 Sheep\" \u2014 that means **Player 0 offers 2 Ore, wants 5 Brick and 3 Sheep from us**.\n\nWait \u2014 that contradicts earlier!\n\nLet me re-read.\n\n\"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 2 Ore -> Requested items: 5 Brick, 3 Sheep\"\n\nThat means: Player 0 is offering **2 Ore** to Player 1, and wants **5 Brick and 3 Sheep** in return.\n\nBut in our inventory: we have 18 Brick and 12 Sheep. That trade would mean:\n\nWe give: 5 Brick + 3 Sheep = 110 + 54 = 164 value  \nWe receive: 2 Ore = 66 value  \nThat\u2019s a **net loss of 98 value**.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was the other way around!\n\nMistake corrected.\n\nSo: when we offered \"2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 3 Sheep\", that meant **we give 2 Ore, receive 5 Brick and 3 Sheep**  \nBut that would only make sense if we had Brick and Sheep to receive.\n\nBut we already have high amounts.\n\nBut value-wise: we gain 164, lose 66 \u2192 **+98**\n\nBut: **that trade was us offering to give 2 Ore, get 5 Brick + 3 Sheep**\n\nBut Brick and Sheep are **lower value per unit** than Ore.\n\nOre: 33  \nBrick: 22  \nSheep: 18  \n\nSo trading 2 Ore (66) for 5 Brick (110) and 3 Sheep (54) is **+98 value**\n\nBut wait \u2014 5\u00d722 = 110? 5\u00d722=110, yes. 3\u00d718=54. Total 164. Minus 66 = +98.\n\nBut is that possible? Are we trading down in quality but up in quantity?\n\nYes \u2014 numerically, value increases, but **we are converting a scarce high-value resource into more of abundant medium-value ones**.\n\nBut **Player 0's identical offer** \u2014 \"2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 3 Sheep\" \u2014 means **they give us 2 Ore, want 5 Brick and 3 Sheep from us**.\n\nThat would be: we give 5 Brick (110) + 3 Sheep (54) = 164 value  \nReceive 2 Ore (66) \u2192 **net loss of 98**\n\nSo their offer to us is **bad for us** \u2014 a trap?\n\nBut we rejected it \u2014 good.\n\nBut when we made the offer: **we were willing to give 2 Ore for 5 Brick + 3 Sheep**, which is **great for us** \u2014 we get more value.\n\nUnless... the mapping is wrong.\n\nClarify format:  \n[Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]  \nSo **Offerer gives \"Offered\", wants \"Requested\"**\n\nSo when **Player 1 offers: 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 3 Sheep**  \n\u2192 Player 1 gives 2 Ore, receives 5 Brick + 3 Sheep\n\nThat\u2019s **+98 value** \u2014 favorable.\n\nBut when **Player 0 offers: 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 3 Sheep**  \n\u2192 Player 0 gives 2 Ore, wants 5 Brick + 3 Sheep from us.\n\nSo we would be giving 5 Brick + 3 Sheep (164) to get 2 Ore (66) \u2192 **\u201398 value** \u2014 terrible.\n\nWe rejected correctly.\n\nSo **our own offer was good**, **their mirrored offer is bad for us**.\n\nWe must not confuse the direction.\n\n[Expert: Resource Valuation Analyst]  \nRevised Step 1:  \nOur initial offer: 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 3 Sheep = **us give 2 Ore (66), get 5 Brick (110) + 3 Sheep (54) = +98 value**\n\nNumerically excellent.\n\nBut strategic concern: do we want more Brick and Sheep? We already have 18 Brick (most of any), 12 Sheep. Expanding further may not help unless we can use them (but game doesn't specify uses \u2014 only total value).\n\nSince goal is **increase total value**, and this trade does that, it may be acceptable.\n\nBut we should instead **seek to trade our abundance (Brick, Sheep, Wheat) for high-value or scarce resources like Ore or Wood?**\n\nWe have low Wood (9), value 8 \u2014 not high, but could be needed.\n\nBetter target: **Ore** \u2014 we have 7, but value 33 is highest. If we can obtain more, excellent.\n\nBut trading away our 2 Ore to get more of abundant resources doesn\u2019t improve strategic position \u2014 unless we have a way to use Brick/Sheep later.\n\nBut no \u2014 value is solely based on sum of resource values.\n\nSo: **trading 2 Ore (66) for 5 Brick (110) + 3 Sheep (54) increases total value by 98** \u2014 ideal.\n\nWait \u2014 but we must **receive** higher value.\n\nIn this trade, we receive value of 164 (5 Brick + 3 Sheep), give 66 (2 Ore) \u2192 net +98.\n\nYes.\n\nBut: is this realistic? Why would anyone accept that?\n\nBecause Player 0 might value Ore even higher \u2014 or have use for it (e.g., development cards).\n\nSo our offer is strong \u2014 but Player 0 rejected it.\n\nThen they **mirrored** it \u2014 meaning they thought it was fair or good for them.\n\nBut if they give us 2 Ore and get 5 Brick + 3 Sheep, that would mean they give 66, get 164 \u2014 **they gain 98**.\n\nSo their mirrored offer, if accepted, would cost us 98 value.\n\nThey are offering a **reverse** of our good offer \u2014 one that\u2019s good for them.\n\nSo both offers are asymmetric.\n\nConclusion: **Our original offer is excellent** if accepted.\n\nWe should **re-offer it**, but perhaps sweeten slightly to increase chance.\n\nBut we already offered \u2014 they rejected.\n\nNow, they mirrored \u2014 we rejected (correctly, because their version is bad).\n\nSo next move: **re-offer our original favorable offer**.\n\n[Expert: Game Theory Strategist]  \nRevised Step 2:  \nThe critical insight:  \n- Our offer (we give 2 Ore \u2192 get 5 Brick + 3 Sheep) is **strongly +EV for us** (+98)\n- Their mirrored offer (we give 5 Brick + 3 Sheep \u2192 get 2 Ore) is **strongly -EV for us** (\u201398)\n\nBut they made the mirror offer \u2014 why?\n\nPossibility 1: They misread the format.\nPossibility 2: They believe the exchange rate is fair and want to trade in that bundle, regardless of direction.\nPossibility 3: They have excess Ore, lack Brick and Sheep \u2014 meaning opposite inventory.\n\nWait \u2014 they are offering **2 Ore** to get **5 Brick + 3 Sheep**.\n\nSo they must have **at least 2 Ore** to offer.\n\nBut earlier, they wanted **1 Ore** in exchange for 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat \u2014 so they value Ore highly, but now they\u2019re offering it?\n\nContradiction?\n\nUnless \u2014 their first two offers were them **wanting** Ore.\n\nThen after we offered to give 2 Ore for 5 Brick + 3 Sheep, they said: \u201cOkay, we'll give 2 Ore for 5 Brick + 3 Sheep\u201d \u2014 which would mean they want to sell Ore.\n\nBut why?\n\nMost likely: **they don\u2019t understand the format**.\n\nPossibly, they intended to request 2 Ore, not offer it.\n\nBecause:  \n- First two offers: both **request Ore** (1 or 2)\n- Then our offer: give 2 Ore, get 5 Brick + 3 Sheep\n- Then their offer: 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 3 Sheep \u2014 same wording\n\nThis strongly suggests **format confusion**: they think \u201cOffered -> Requested\u201d means \u201cI want to receive -> give\u201d, but the actual format is \u201cgive -> get\u201d.\n\nSo when they wrote \u201c2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 3 Sheep\u201d, they likely mean **they give 2 Ore to get 5 Brick and 3 Sheep** \u2014 but that contradicts prior behavior.\n\nUnless they have a surplus of Ore suddenly \u2014 unlikely.\n\nConclusion: **Player 0 is confused about the trade format**.\n\nThey meant to request 2 Ore, not offer it.\n\nSo their last offer was a **mistake**.\n\nWe can exploit or correct.\n\nBut as rational player, we should **pursue the only deal that benefits us**: **getting more value in high-value resources**.\n\nBest idea: **Offer to give multiple lower-value items for 1 or 2 Ore**\n\nFor example: offer 5 Brick + 3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore\n\nValue: give 110 + 54 = 164, get 33 \u2192 terrible.\n\nNo.\n\nWe want to **acquire Ore**, not give it.\n\nWe have 7 Ore \u2014 valuable, but if we trade 1 or 2, only if return is >66.\n\nSo: minimum return for 1 Ore: >33 value  \nFor 2 Ore: >66\n\nWe can offer, for example:  \n**5 Wheat + 5 Wood + 5 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore**  \nValue: 25 + 40 + 90 = 155 \u2192 for 66 \u2192 bad for us.\n\nWe need to trade low-value items for high-value ones.\n\nWe have:  \n- Wheat: 12, value 5 \u2014 ideal for trading away  \n- Wood: 9, value 8 \u2014 also low  \n\nSo: offer **10 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore**  \nValue out: 50 + 24 = 74  \nValue in: 33 \u2192 we lose, but maybe they accept\n\nBut we want value increase.\n\nBetter: **10 Wheat + 5 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore**  \nOut: 50 + 90 = 140  \nIn: 66 \u2192 we lose 74 \u2014 no\n\nWait \u2014 we want to **receive** net positive value.\n\nSo we should **receive Ore** in exchange for lower-value bundles.\n\nBut Ore is high-value \u2014 hard to get without giving high-value resources.\n\nAlternative: trade for **different resource entirely** \u2014 but only if it exists.\n\nOnly known resources: Wheat, Wood, Sheep, Brick, Ore.\n\nWe have all.\n\nSo must trade excess (Wheat, Brick, Sheep) for more high-value (Ore, or multiple Wood/units).\n\nBut Wood is low value.\n\nBest opportunity: exploit Player 0\u2019s apparent desire for **Ore** \u2014 they want it.\n\nSo we can **sell 1 Ore at premium**.\n\nFor example: **1 Ore \u2192 10 Brick**  \nValue: 33 \u2192 220 \u2014 massive gain\n\nOr **1 Ore \u2192 6 Sheep** \u2192 33 \u2192 108\n\nBut is that possible?\n\nPlayer 0 previously offered 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat (89 value) for 1 Ore \u2014 so they\u2019re willing to pay up to 89 for 1 Ore.\n\nWe can aim for similar.\n\nSo: **Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep, 5 Wheat**  \nThis is similar to what they proposed, but in reverse.\n\nBut we would give 33 to get 54 + 25 = 79 \u2192 **+46 value**\n\nWait \u2014 no: if we offer 1 Ore, and request 3 Sheep and 5 Wheat, then:\n\nWe give: 1 Ore = 33  \nWe get: 3 Sheep (54) + 5 Wheat (25) = 79  \nNet: **+46 value** \u2014 acceptable\n\nAnd we reduce our Ore by 1 (from 7 to 6), gain more Sheep and Wheat \u2014 which have lower per-unit value but combine to higher total.\n\nBut: do we want more Sheep and Wheat? They are abundant.\n\nBut value is pure sum \u2014 so yes, +46 is good.\n\nAnd it matches Player 0\u2019s valuation \u2014 they previously offered 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, so they might accept giving 1 Ore for that, meaning **they want 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat** and are willing to pay 1 Ore.\n\nBut that was their **offer to us**: they offered 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat to get 1 Ore.\n\nSo they value 1 Ore > 89.\n\nTherefore, we can request more.\n\nBetter offer: **1 Ore -> 5 Brick**\n\nValue: 33 vs 110 \u2192 +77\n\nOr **1 Ore -> 4 Brick + 2 Sheep** = 88 + 36 = 124 \u2192 +91\n\nOr **2 Ore -> 10 Brick** = 66 vs 220 \u2192 +154 \u2014 very strong.\n\nBut might be rejected.\n\nStart with soft offer.\n\n[Expert: Trade Negotiator (Behavioral Economics)]  \nStep 3: Craft the offer using anchoring.\n\nPlayer 0 signaled they value 1 Ore at over 89 (based on their second offer).\n\nSo we can ask for, say, 4 Brick + 2 Sheep for 1 Ore.\n\nValue out: 33  \nValue in: 88 + 36 = 124  \nNet: +91\n\nThey previously paid 54+25=79 for 1 Ore, so 124 is higher, but not outrageous.\n\nAlternatively, since they tried to copy our offer, they may accept bundles around that size.\n\nOffer: **1 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep**  \nValue: give 33, get 110 + 36 = 146 \u2192 **+113 value**\n\nThis is excellent.\n\nCheck if we have enough: Ore = 7 \u2014 yes, give 1. Brick: we receive. Sheep: receive.\n\nSo total value increases.\n\nAnd it\u2019s consistent with trade dynamics.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nWe reject all previous bad offers.\n\nMake new offer to maximize value.\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]",
