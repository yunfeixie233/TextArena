      "response": "Let's introduce three different trading experts to help you decide on the best trade strategy.\n\n### Expert 1: Resource Value Analyst\nThis expert focuses on the value of resources based on current market trends. \n\n**Step 1:**  \nReview current resources and values to find leverage for a trade. The most valuable resource is currently Ore (value 32), followed by Brick (value 29). Since I have 14 Ore, I could offer some Ore in exchange for Brick, which will enhance my overall resources.\n\n### Expert 2: Market Demand Specialist\nThis expert pays attention to what resources are in demand and which ones the market is oversaturated with.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nEvaluate market trends and potential trading partners. Brick seems to be in high demand, based on recent trades, meaning that I can leverage my surplus Ore to try and acquire more Brick. The focus should be on obtaining resources that are scarce in the market.\n\n### Expert 3: Trade Strategist\nThis expert devises strategies on how to optimize trades for future gains, keeping long-term resource management in mind.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nConsider the long-term value of resources. Wheat and Wood might be less valuable in terms of trading power, but they can be useful for sustaining future trades, especially for a supply of resources. Therefore, I should trade but ensure that I don't deplete these completely.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**  \nNow that each expert has contributed their initial step of thinking about the negotiation game, I will propose my first offer based on their insights.\n\n### Proposed Offer\nCombining the insights from all three experts, I will make the following offer:\n**[Offer: 5 Ore, 3 Sheep -> 5 Brick, 2 Wheat]** \n\nThis would allow me to acquire more Brick while parting with resources that have reached a peak value in the market, as per the analysis of the Resource Value Analyst. The Market Demand Specialist highlighted Brick's demand, making it advantageous to target.\n\nNow, we can await the response to this offer or assess further actions based on feedback.",

The current trade results in a loss, but let\u2019s consider the future:\n\n- Player 1 accepted, meaning they find value in the trade. This could imply they may offer resources later, creating a chance for further beneficial trades.\n- I should also analyze what resources are rare or in high demand among other players since that knowledge may offer an edge.\n\n*Step 2: Propose Next Move*  \nGiven Player 0's diminished Ore and Sheep but an increase in Brick and Wheat, I would consider offering a balanced resource of 3 Brick, 2 Wheat for 4 Ore from another player, which could help recover some lost value.

      "response": "Let's break down the situation and analyze the decision-making process step-by-step through the perspectives of three different experts who offer insights on how to maximize the total value of resources.\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Optimizer\n- **Analysis**: I've noticed that Player 0 currently has a good stockpile of Ore and Brick, both of which are high-value resources. After the first trade with Player 1, Player 0 successfully increased their resource pool, but now they need to be strategic about trades that can be accepted.\n- **Next Step**: I see that Player 1 is looking for Wheat and is offering Sheep. The value of Sheep is lower compared to Wheat, so we need to be cautious. I suggest we consider how many Wheat we are willing to part with versus what we gain in Sheep. \n\n##### Thinking for the next step:\n- Given the current offer from Player 1, it seems reasonable to accept the trade if it increases the total value of my resources, especially since we have excess Wheat. \n\n### Expert 2: The Tactical Trader\n- **Analysis**: The first trade was beneficial for Player 0, but there seems to be an imbalance in resources now. Player 1 is holding out on Wheat and seems hesitant to trade unless the offer is highly favorable to them. This could be an opportunity.\n- **Next Step**: I propose that we consider making an offer that will leverage our current large quantity of Ore and potentially position us to acquire more diverse resources while keeping Brick as a defensive asset.\n\n##### Proposed Action:\n- **Trade Offer**: [Offer: 4 Ore -> 2 Wheat, 3 Sheep]. This could allow us to restock on Wheat and Sheep without losing too many high-value resources since Ore has the potential to be traded again.\n\n### Expert 3: The Cautious Strategist\n- **Analysis**: My outlook leans towards a more cautious approach. Although Player 0 has made beneficial trades, we should be wary of making too many transactions that could compromise our higher-value assets.\n- **Next Step**: Notice that Player 1 rejected the trade for Ore. This suggests they may not value Ore as highly as we need them to. Instead, focusing on trades that involve acquiring more Wheat and balancing Sheep might be more beneficial.\n\n##### Recommended Action:\n- I suggest that we respond to Player 1's offer of 4 Wheat for 2 Sheep by assessing our needs. I\u2019m thinking it might be safer to **[Accept]** this offer since It balances our resource pool while allowing us a slight increase in Sheep\u2014useful for future trades.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWe have a consolidated strategy in place where we can consider trades based on our maximizing values while having varying perspectives to guide our decisions. At this point, I recommend we consider:\n1. Accepting Player 1\u2019s offer of 4 Wheat for 2 Sheep.\n2. Preparing an offer based on optimal resources for the next turn.\n3. Always keeping in mind the total value we aim to achieve with each trade, focusing on Wheat and maintaining a buffer in high-value resources like Ore and Brick.\n\nIn turn, I will take the action: **[Accept]** Player 1\u2019s offer of 4 Wheat for 2 Sheep.",

Possibly deny any offers that do not come with substantial benefit.\n\n**Proposed Action:**  \n`[Deny]` (if Player 1's offer appears unfavorable for my resource balance)\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: The Value Walker**  \n*Focus: Evaluating trades based on the comparative value of resources and the overall market status.*\n\nCurrent Inventory Analysis:\nValue of my current resources seems stable, but without future trades, I could miss out on opportunities to convert lesser-valued resources into higher-valued ones.\n\nTo growth my resource value beyond what I currently have, I should look for opportunities where I can offer low-value resources (like Wheat) for collective resource wins (like Brick or Wheat). \n\n**Next Action:** Should Player 1 offer resources, I might consider the potential through value evaluation.\n\n**Proposed Offer:**  \n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 3 Brick]` (Looking to maximize value per trade with essential balance)\n\n---\n\n### Summarized Actions to Proceed:\n\n- **Offer by Expert 1:** `[Offer: 3 Ore -> 5 Sheep]`\n- **Decision by Expert 2:** `[Deny]` any low-value trade unless necessary.\n- **Offer by Expert 3:** `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 3 Brick]`\n\nFinalize based on what Player 1 proposes and evaluate responses for strategic increases in total resource value.",

      "response": "In the Negotiation Game, it's crucial to make strategic trades to enhance your resource value. Below are the evaluations and suggestions from three different types of experts.\n\n### Expert 1: The Broker\n**Analysis:** \nThe Broker focuses on making trades that offer more total value, considering both what you give and receive. \n\n1. Currently, your resources are:\n   - Wheat: 5 x 10 = 50\n   - Wood: 11 x 15 = 165\n   - Sheep: 13 x 8 = 104\n   - Brick: 29 x 5 = 145\n   - Ore: 32 x 14 = 448\n   - **Total Value: 912**\n\n2. The last trade with Player 1 (3 Ore for 5 Sheep) increases your sheep count but notes:\n   - Value decrease from 3 Ore (3 x 32 = 96) while gaining 5 Sheep (5 x 13 = 65). Net loss of 31 value.\n\n3. Conclusion: To enhance value, consider reversing sheep trade by offering excess resources or strategizing with those who have valuable bricks or wood.\n\n**Action Proposal:** \n- Offer 5 Wheat for 2 Brick, based on observing Players trading more valuable resources in the market.\n- **Proposed Action:** [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Brick]\n\n### Expert 2: The Analyzer\n**Analysis:**\nThe Analyzer focuses on maximizing value exchange and resource balance.\n\n1. Current resources have solid value; however, backup Ore is needed for potential future trades.\n2. Observing Player 1's stack shows they value Brick highly, making it a strategic priority.\n3. Notably, after trading for Ore and Sheep, you may create a surplus of Wheat.\n\n4. **Recommendation:** Maintain a balance of Ore and Sheep while growing Wheat - leverage for trades needing immediate replenishment. \n\n**Action Proposal:**\n- Accept Player 1\u2019s offer of 1 Sheep for 3 Wheat if it's immediate, allowing the acquisition of more sheep for potential bigger trades.\n- **Proposed Action:** [Accept]\n\n### Expert 3: The Risk-Taker\n**Analysis:**\nThe Risk-Taker focuses on high-reward, high-risk trades aiming to acquire fewer but more potent resources.\n\n1. You've traded many Ore resources, losing potential value. High-value players will go for low bids if need be.\n2. Therefore, leverage lesser-used resources like Sheep; they branch out their potential.\n3. Want to accumulate Ore back while engaging in fewer Wheat trades, focusing on capitalizing on your Brick while obtaining varied resource types.\n\n**Action Proposal:**\n- Trade 2 Wheat for 1 Ore, increasing your safeguard against other players trying to bank on your low Ore count.\n- **Proposed Action:** [Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\n### Summary of Proposals\n1. **Broker's Proposal:** [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Brick]\n2. **Analyzer's Proposal:** [Accept]\n3. **Risk-Taker's Proposal:** [Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nAs Player 0, you can consider these offers strategically, weighing risks and values before making a choice!",

      "response": "### Expert Analysis for Player 0's Trading Strategy\n\n**Expert 1: Resource Analyst**\n- **Step 1:** Analyze the current resource values and balance which resources are resembling an oversupply or demand in my inventory.\n- Wheat: 5 (10 total), Wood: 11 (15 total), Sheep: 13 (8 total), Brick: 29 (5 total), Ore: 32 (14 total).\n- High-value items: Ore and Brick. With lower quantities of Sheep but a higher value per unit. \n\n**Expert 2: Negotiation Specialist**\n- **Step 1:** Focus on past offers to assess the trading trends. Player 1 has been inclined to accept trades that offer better unit values for resources they need. \n- Analyze what Player 1 is lacking based on their trades and current offers; they might need more sheep or wheat based on their accepted and rejected offers.\n\n**Expert 3: Market Strategist**\n- **Step 1:** Look at market trends in trading and assess what Player 1's responses indicate about their strategy.\n- Player 1 has shown hesitance in paying 5 Wheat for low-value Brick. This might mean they perceive Wheat as a more vital resource. \n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Initial Strategy Discussion**\n\n**Expert 1:**\n- I suggest prioritizing trades that give me high-value bricks and ores while boosting my sheep resource as I'm down to 8 remaining. Trading resources I have in surplus, like Wood and Wheat, will be key.\n\n**Expert 2:**\n- I recommend offering 2 Wheat or Sheep in trades that focus on increasing Ore or Brick. This has been accepted before by Player 1, indicating they may value those resources.\n\n**Expert 3:**\n- Focus offers towards gaining resources that are overvalued in the current inventory while offloading excess resources. If they perceive my Wheat as valuable, it could warrant a better offer.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Preparing Future Offers**\n\n**Expert 1:**\n- I propose we should look into a deal that offers a significant surplus of Ore or Brick; for instance, something along the lines of '[Offer: 5 Ore, 2 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 3 Sheep]'.\n\n**Expert 2:**\n- I\u2019d recommend keeping track of Player 1's needs with each trade as a strategic negotiation play. They might hesitate on something high in quantity unless it\u2019s low in their inventory.\n\n**Expert 3:**\n- Since Player 1 is showing return trades on Ore, I could swap out my lesser valuable Wood or repetitively show demand for Ore. \n\n---\n\n### Next Moves\n\n- Player 0 should carefully curate offers to maintain pressure while optimizing for both value and supply. Emphasizing trades that empower the resource base by capitalizing on Player 1's trading behavior will likely yield better resource value adjustments.\n\n#### Example Trade Offer Prepared\n- **[Offer: 5 Ore, 2 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 3 Sheep]** (Aligning with insights from experts, focusing on current supply and demand efficiency).\n\n### Conclusion\nBy collaborating with the insights presented by these experts, an optimized offer can be crafted to enhance the total value of resources possessed by Player 0.",
