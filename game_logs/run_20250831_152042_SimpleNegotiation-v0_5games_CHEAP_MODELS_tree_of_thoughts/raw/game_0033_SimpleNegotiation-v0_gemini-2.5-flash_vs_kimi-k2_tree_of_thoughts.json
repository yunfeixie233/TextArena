      "response": "I\u2019ll choose three complementary experts:\n\n1. Value Maximizer \u2013 obsessed with measurable surplus.  \n2. Rarity Analyst \u2013 cares only about relative scarcities and leverage.  \n3. Marginal Utility Strategist \u2013 focuses on the last unit of each type rather than total stock.\n\nStep-1 thoughts\n\nValue Maximizer (VM): \u201cMy portfolio total is 7\u00b75+20\u00b79+6\u00b712+23\u00b729+7\u00b737 = 1 425. Because Brick\u2019s value (29) is tied for 2nd-highest with a huge quantity, any net gain in Brick for less than 29-value-per-unit is a win. Conversely, Wheat has the lowest marginal value (5). Initial play: seek 1-for-1 trades giving up Wheat for nearly anything useful.\u201d\n\nRarity Analyst (RA): \u201cScarcity is the inverse of the natural-resource abundance curve. Opponents, thought of collectively, have a median stock of each resource too; if I\u2019m rich in a resource, they\u2019re scarce in it, granting leverage. I\u2019m flush with Brick (23) and Wood (20) but tight in Sheep (6) and Ore (7). I should dangle my excess Brick as if it were plentiful for them and use it to corner scarcer resources (mainly Ore).\u201d\n\nMarginal Utility Strategist (MUS): \u201cValue per unit \u2260 value of the marginal unit when you already have 23 Brick. Extra Brick past ~20+ means one more sheep-pasture enclosure; marginal value tanks.

Prioritize trading away lower-value items for higher-value items.\n*   **Step 1:** \"Our highest value resource per unit is Ore (39), followed by Brick (22). Our lowest are Wheat (6) and Wood (9). My primary goal is to acquire more Ore and Brick, and divest resources like Wheat and Wood if we can get a good return.\"\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Balancer**\n*   **Focus:** Maintain a healthy diversity of resources while still aiming for value. Avoid becoming too reliant on a single resource or completely depleting one.\n*   **Step 1:** \"We have a decent quantity of all resources, with Wood being our most abundant. However, our quantities of Brick (10) are relatively low compared to others. While value is key, we should also consider acquiring more Brick to maintain balance and potential future flexibility.\"\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\n*   **Focus:** Identify potential favorable exchanges based on initial observations and the relative value of my resources compared to what others *might* need or offer. Look for immediate opportunities.\n*   **Step 1:** \"Given our high quantity of Wood and relatively high quantity of Sheep, but lower quantity of Brick, I'm thinking of packaging some lower-value items we have in abundance for higher-value items we want more of. Specifically, I'm eyeing Brick and Ore. Player 1 made no offer, so we have the initiative.\"\n\n---\n\n**Consolidated Strategy based on Expert Input:**\n\n*   **Primary Goal:** Acquire more high-value resources (Ore, Brick).\n*   **Secondary Goal:** Reduce quantity of lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) if the trade yields a significant value increase.\n*   **Specific Target:** Increase Brick quantity, given its good value and our relatively lower stock. Ore is always a priority.\n*   **Resources to Offer:** Wood, Sheep, Wheat (due to quantity and/or lower per-unit value).\n\n---\n\n**Next Step for Experts (Considering what to offer/request):**\n\n**Expert 1 (Value Maximizer):**\n*   **Step 2:** \"Let's quantify potential offers. If we offer, say, 3 Sheep (3*13=39) and 2 Wood (2*9=18) for a total value of 57, what could we ask for? We'd ideally want 2 Brick (2*22=44) and perhaps 1 Ore (1*39=39), for a total of 83. This would be a gain of 26 value. That's a good target.\"\n\n**Expert 2 (Resource Balancer):**\n*   **Step 2:** \"I agree that Brick should be a focus. We have 20 Sheep, which is a fair amount, and its value isn't so low that we'd take a huge hit trading it. It's often requested. I'd lean towards offering Sheep to get Brick, rather than depleting our Wood too much if we can avoid it, especially since Wood is often needed for buildings.\"\n\n**Expert 3 (Opportunistic Trader):**\n*   **Step 2:** \"Based on our high Sheep quantity and its mid-range value, it's a good candidate to put on the table. Everyone needs Sheep for settlements and development cards. I'm thinking of starting with an offer that includes Sheep, aiming for Brick specifically, as Player 1 might value Brick differently than we do.\"\n\n---\n\n**Decision based on Expert Input:**\n\nOffering Sheep seems agreeable to all. It's abundant, mid-value, and likely to be desired. Requesting Brick aligns with both value maximization and resource balancing. Ore is always a good addition if possible.\n\nLet's try a balanced offer that gives up some quantity but gains higher value resources.\n\n**Considering an offer:**\n*   Offer: 3 Sheep (3 * 13 = 39 value) + 2 Wood (2 * 9 = 18 value) = 57 value\n*   Request: 2 Brick (2 * 22 = 44 value) + 1 Ore (1 * 39 = 39 value) = 83 value\n*   Net Gain: 83 - 57 = 26 value. This is strong.\n\nLet's simplify for the first offer, making it appealing and testing the waters. Perhaps offering a slightly higher quantity of Sheep for a direct Brick/Ore exchange.\n\nWhat if we offer a significant amount of a moderately valuable resource (Sheep) for slightly less of a higher value resource (Ore/Brick)?\n\n**Another consideration:**\n*   Offer: 5 Sheep (5 * 13 = 65 value)\n*   Request: 2 Brick (2 * 22 = 44 value) + 1 Ore (1 * 39 = 39 value) = 83 value\n*   Net Gain: 83 - 65 = 18 value. Still good, and it's a cleaner offer (fewer resource types given).\n\nLet's try this specific offer. It directly targets our high-value needs (Brick, Ore) by leveraging our high Sheep quantity.\n\n**[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]**",

      "response": "Here's a breakdown of the experts' thinking process, following your instructions:\n\n### Expert 1: Resource Scarcity & High Value (The \"Hoarder\")\n\nThis expert focuses on holding onto high-value resources and acquiring more of them, especially those that are perceived as rarer or more difficult to obtain.\n\n**Thought Process - Step 1:** \"My current total value is: (12 * 6) + (22 * 9) + (20 * 13) + (10 * 22) + (18 * 39) = 72 + 198 + 260 + 220 + 702 = 1452. The recent offer from Player 1 was: 3 Sheep (Value: 3 * 13 = 39) for 2 Brick (Value: 2 * 22 = 44) + 1 Ore (Value: 1 * 39 = 39) + 1 Wheat (Value: 1 * 6 = 6). The proposed value gain for me is (44 + 39 + 6) - 39 = 50. This looks like a positive trade in terms of total value. However, I need to consider my strategic holdings. Sheep is relatively abundant for me, Ore and Brick are high-value resources. I previously offered 5 Sheep for 2 Brick and 1 Ore. This offer is somewhat similar but Player 1 is asking for more in return for their Brick and Ore. My previous offer was better for me from a value perspective (5 Sheep = 65, 2 Brick + 1 Ore = 44 + 39 = 83, gain of 18). This current offer gives me a larger value gain (50) but for less of the high-value resources I want to acquire. I need to get more high-value resources, not just a numerical value increase.\"\n\n### Expert 2: Strategic Resource Balancing & Efficiency (The \"Optimiser\")\n\nThis expert aims to balance resource quantities, reducing excess low-value resources and acquiring needed high-value resources efficiently.\n\n**Thought Process - Step 1:** \"Current resources: Wheat (low value, sufficient quantity), Wood (mid-value, sufficient quantity), Sheep (mid-value, abundant quantity), Brick (high-value, decent but could use more), Ore (very high-value, good quantity but always want more). My prior offer of 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore aimed to shed excess Sheep for high-value Brick and Ore. Player 1 rejected this. Their latest offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore, 1 Wheat. This is interesting. It still lets me shed Sheep and gain Brick and Ore, which are my targets. The addition of Wheat means I reduce my high-value gain slightly for a low-value resource I already have. However, the value exchange is positive for me. I\u2019m giving up 39 value and gaining 44 + 39 + 6 = 89 value. A net gain of 50. This is a very good numerical gain, even if Wheat isn't my primary target. Compared to my previous offer where I only gained 18 value, this is significantly better. It's an efficient way to increase my total value, and reduce my abundant Sheep.\"\n\n### Expert 3: Opportunistic Trading & Immediate Value (The \"Trader\")\n\nThis expert focuses on identifying and executing trades that offer an immediate and significant positive value gain, regardless of long-term strategy as much as the other experts.\n\n**Thought Process - Step 1:** \"My current total value is 1452. Player 1 just offered: 3 Sheep (my resources) for 2 Brick, 1 Ore, 1 Wheat (their resources).\nValue of what I give up: 3 * 13 = 39.\nValue of what I receive: (2 * 22) + (1 * 39) + (1 * 6) = 44 + 39 + 6 = 89.\nNet value change for me = 89 - 39 = +50.\nThis is a straightforward positive value trade. It increases my total wealth significantly. My previous offer of 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore had a much smaller value gain (+18). This offer from Player 1 is much more favorable to me in terms of pure numerical value increase per trade. I should accept trades that clearly increase my wealth.\"\n\n---\n**Decision:**\n\nThe advice from all three experts points towards accepting this offer due to the significant positive value gain. While Expert 1 acknowledges the gain might not be ideal for resource *types*, the sheer value increase is hard to ignore, especially compared to previous rejected offers. Expert 2 sees it as an efficient value increase and a way to shed abundant Sheep. Expert 3 sees it as an immediate and undeniable gain.\n\n[Accept]",

Ore (37) is worth 6.2 Wheat. Sheep (12) is worth 2.4 Wheat or 1.3 Wood. My marginal value for every extra Sheep is lower than when I had 6 left.\n\nStep-2: \u201cSpot where that hurts most.\u201d  \nI just gave up 3 Sheep (-36 value) to gain 2 Brick (58) + 1 Ore (37) + 1 Wheat (5) = +100-36 \u2192 +64 overall. That was still slightly positive because Brick/ Ore/Wheat were scarcer in my mix.\n\nStep-3: \u201cNew slate math.\u201d  \nAfter the accepted trade, amounts are:\nWheat: 8 (value 40)  \nWood: 20 (value 180)  \nSheep: 3 (value 36)  \nBrick: 21 (value 609) \u2192 twice the Wheat total value.  \nOre: 6 (value 222)\n\nConclusion: Brick is mildly oversupplied; my next deal should convert Brick into higher-marginal-return resources: Ore (biggest gap) and maybe some Wood or Wheat for faster play.\n\n\u2500\u2500 Expert 2: Supply-Scarcity Strategist \u2500\u2500  \nStep-1: \u201cRelative inventory size.\u201d  \nPost-trade counts: Wheat 8 \u2248 27 % of your non-Wood items; Wood is still 20 (largest single pile but mid-value). Ore sits at only 6 (low relative to its 37 value).\n\nStep-2: \u201cAsk what Player 0 demands.\u201d  \nEarlier, Player 0 wanted 2 Brick + 1 Ore for 5 Sheep. We denied that, then made the 3-Sheep-for-more swap. Player 0\u2019s appetite for Brick was clear; their own supply in Brick looks low.\n\nStep-3: \u201cFind overlaps with own needs.\u201d  \nI have 21 Brick\u2014plenty. However, I only have 6 Ore\u2014dangerously thin. Player 0 clearly values Brick highly. Therefore any new offer should export Brick and import Ore, not export Ore.\n\n\u2500\u2500 Expert 3: Psychological / Turn-Timer Mapper \u2500\u2500  \nStep-1: \u201cClock says turn 7 of 10\u2014edge of late game.\u201d  \nLast turns are perfect for two-move forced plays: (1) dump surplus to a willing partner, (2) lock in marginal maximums so AI opponents cannot steal value with last-second swings.\n\nStep-2: \u201cTrack their expressed will.\u201d  \nPlayer 0 already signaled they\u2019ll accept any deal that gives them at least 1 Brick per 1.7 Sheep value exchanged. So low friction exists now.\n\nStep-3: \u201cOffer construction.\u201d  \nMake one strong reciprocal offer rather than many small ones. Anchoring late with a single clear, unequal trade keeps surprises off the table and cements perceived generosity.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nI synthesize their lessons:\n\n- My glaring scarcity is Ore (only 6) \u2013 maximal priority.  \n- Player 0 has proven Brick appetite and willing to give Sheep for it.  \n- My Brick is at a small oversupply; one more conversion doesn\u2019t hurt.  \n- The late turn means you want to close step-wise trades quickly.\n\nProposed offer:\nI offer 5 Brick to Player 0 in exchange for 2 Ore.\n\nValue check (marginal-value logic):  \n5 Brick \u2192 5 \u00d7 29 = 145 (I give away)  \n2 Ore \u2192 2 \u00d7 37 = 74 (I gain)  \n\n\u2192 Net 74 - 145 = -71 for me, clearly negative.  \nSo I must instead offer export of a mid-tier good.\n\nRedo: trade Wood (value 9) and Brick (29) in a bundle.\n\nMini-iteration:\nWilling to give 2 Brick (58) + 2 Wood (18) \u2192 76 total outflow  \nLikely target ask: 3 Ore (111) \u2192 111 - 76 = +35 net gain.  \nBut the player pattern suggests they want Sheep more than Ore; I should leverage Brick-to-Sheep conversion directly to free value gap for subsequent Ore purchase.\n\nSimpler, higher-odds path: offer pure Brick for Ore in smaller ratios to pass psychological filter.\n\n[Offer: 4 Brick -> 2 Ore] value export 116 -> gain 74 \u2192 -42 net \u21d2 still negative.\n\nThat won\u2019t clear expert 1\u2019s margin test.\n\nRefocus on Wood-to-Ore swap:\n4 Wood (36) ->  1 Ore (37). Net +1, trivial.\n\nExpert 2 advises leveraging Brick over-supply not just minor Wood crate.  \n\nBundle approach:  \nOffer 3 Brick + 2 Wood \u2192  2 Ore  \nValue: 87 + 18 = 105 away \u2192  74 back \u2192 -31 gain. Not enough.\n\nOnly way to net positive on this player requires Sheep on their side.  \n\nCurrent best single trade combo for positive absolute value increment with Player 0:\n\nOffer 6 Brick (174) \u2192 2 Ore (74) + 3 Sheep (36) \u2192 110 vs 174, net -64.\n\nThus nothing with Player 0\u2019s known tastes gives immediate increment on totals in pure Brick-for-Ore form.\n\nTherefore the experts recommend:\n\nShift to acquire Wood/Wheat via Brick first, then retrade Wood/Wheat towards Ore with another opponent (but only Player 0 is available here\u2014single opponent at hands, so we must do direct swap).\n\nWe therefore confess that with the single opponent already highly Brick-desirous and Ore-scarcity unmet by their roster, no pure Brick-for-Ore gain play actually nets positive. Hence expert 1 withdraws secondary offer attempt to wait for final move passive spike (step-pass), merely making trivial dual item swap:\n\nExecute \u201cclean up value late\u201d:\n\n[Offer: 4 Brick, 1 Wood -> 3 Ore] \u2192 net gain: 3\u00d737 = 111; give 4\u00d729 = 116 + 1\u00d79 =9 grand total 125 invest \u2013111 return \u2192 still net -14.\n\nEven best near-linear swap fails marginal test.\n\nConsequently, experts unanimously:\n\nNone imparts sustainable positive value under strict marginal count for given inventory ratios with available trade partner.

I also need to consider player 1's previous offers and acceptances to understand what they are trying to achieve.\n\n**Expert 3: Opponent Profiler**\n*Initial Thought:* Player 1's last offer was 3 Sheep for 2 Brick, 1 Ore, 1 Wheat, which I accepted. This suggests they are valuing Sheep highly, or seeking to offload them while getting Brick and Ore. Now they are offering 4 Brick for 2 Ore. This confirms their interest in Ore and potentially their willingness to part with Brick. They are consistently targeting my high-value resources.\n\n---\n**Expert 1: Value Maximizer**\n*Step 1:* Calculate the value of the offered items (4 Brick) and the requested items (2 Ore) in the new offer.\nOffer: 4 Brick * 22 = 88\nRequest: 2 Ore * 39 = 78\nThis is a net loss of 10 value if I accept.\n\n**Expert 2: Resource Strategist**\n*Step 1:* I have 10 Brick and 18 Ore. Brick is valued at 22, Ore at 39. Ore is my most valuable abundant resource. Giving up 2 Ore for 4 Brick means giving up high value for a relatively lower value resource. I have a decent amount of Brick, so acquiring more isn't my priority.\n\n**Expert 3: Opponent Profiler**\n*Step 1:* Player 1 is offering 4 Brick (value 88) for 2 Ore (value 78). From a pure value perspective for me, this is a loss of 10. However, Player 1 might see this as beneficial for them. They've consistently pursued Ore.

I want to trade my abundant, low-value resources.\n\n## Expert 2: The Market Strategist\n*Step 2: Determine Player 0's likely inventory and needs.*\n\nBased on trading pattern:\n- Player 0 seems to have excess Brick\n- Player 0 wants Sheep but may now have less (just received 3)\n- Player 0 probably has Ore but doesn't want to give it away cheaply\n\nTarget: Use my excess Wood as trade material since it has the lowest value density.\n\n## Expert 3: The Resource Balance Expert\n*Step 2: Determine sustainable trading ratio targets.*\n\nCurrent inventory after trade:\n- Wheat: 8 (just gained 1)\n- Wood: 20\n- Sheep: 3 (lost 3)\n- Brick: 21 (lost 2, gained 2)\n- Ore: 6 (lost 1, gained 1)\n\nI should use Wood (180 total value, 0.45 value/unit) as my primary trade bait to get more high-value resources.\n\n---\n\n## Expert 1: The Value Analyst\n*Step 3: Calculate optimal Wood-to-premium resource exchange rate.*\n\nWith Wood at 9 value each:\n- Trading 4 Wood (36 value) for 1 Ore (37 value) would be marginally profitable\n- Trading 3 Wood (27 value) for 1 Sheep (12 value) loses value\n- Trading 5 Wood (45 value) for 2 Ore (74 value) nets +29 value\n- Trading 6 Wood (54 value) for 1 Ore + 1 Sheep (49 value) loses value\n\n## Expert 2: The Market Strategist\n*Step 3: Design an offer Player 0 will likely accept based on their known preferences.*\n\nPlayer 0 likes Sheep but now has 3 more from our last trade. They may want Wood to balance their inventory. Since they rejected 4 Brick for 2 Ore, they value Ore more highly.\n\nBetter approach: Offer Wood for Sheep or mixed premium resources.\n\n## Expert 3: The Resource Balance Expert\n*Step 3: Create a balanced trade proposal that improves my position.\n\nI have too much Wood and not enough Sheep/Ore.

Giving up 2 Sheep and 2 Wheat would leave me with 15 Sheep and 11 Wheat. I also have 22 Wood, so gaining 5 more would put me at 27 Wood. This trade increases my volume of a low-value resource but gives me a net positive value gain. Given that I have ample supply of resources to make this trade, it seems acceptable.\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\n*Next thought:* This is a clear win for me in terms of value. I need to accept this offer. It's an immediate gain without negotiation effort.\n\n---\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\n*Next thought:* The trade clearly adds value to my inventory (45 received vs 38 given). I should accept.\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Manager**\n*Next thought:* From a resource management perspective, while I gain more of a low-value resource (Wood), the overall value gain is positive, and I still maintain sufficient quantities of Sheep and Wheat. This trade doesn't hinder future high-value trades.\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\n*Next thought:* No downsides, only upside. Accept.\n\n---\n[Accept]",

I should deny this.\n\n---\n**Expert 1: Value Maximizer**\n*Initial Thought:* My primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I need to carefully evaluate every trade offer by calculating the net value change. I should prioritize acquiring high-value resources like Ore and Brick, and be willing to part with lower-value resources like Wheat and Wood, as long as the trade is profitable. I also need to ensure I don't deplete resources critical for future, potentially larger, profitable trades.\n\n**Expert 2: Resource Balancer**\n*Initial Thought:* While value is important, having a balanced set of resources can also provide strategic flexibility. Being too specialized might limit future trading options. I should identify which resources I have in surplus (high quantity, lower value) and which I am low on, to guide my offers. I also need to consider if holding onto certain quantities of high-value resources is better than trading them for a small profit, especially if they can be used for larger, more profitable exchanges later.\n\n**Expert 3: Opponent Profiler**\n*Initial Thought:* I need to understand Player 1's trading patterns. What resources do they offer frequently? What do they request? By analyzing their past offers, I can infer what resources they might value highly or need, and tailor my offers to them. They accepted my offer of 3 Sheep for Brick/Ore/Wheat, and then offered to give me Wood for Sheep/Wheat. This suggests they might be trying to get rid of Wood, or need Sheep and Wheat. Their last offer of Wood for Ore/Brick/Wheat is potentially them trying to offload Wood for higher value items from me. If they are willing to accept a loss or break-even, that might indicate desperation or a strategic need.\n\n---\n**Expert 1: Value Maximizer**\n*Step 1:* Evaluate the current offer from Player 1: \"9 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat\".\nValue of 9 Wood = 9 * 9 = 81.\nValue of 1 Ore + 1 Brick + 1 Wheat = 39 + 22 + 6 = 67.\nSince the value of what I give (81) is greater than the value of what I receive (67), this trade would result in a net loss of 14 value. I should reject this offer.\n\n**Expert 2: Resource Balancer**\n*Step 1:* Analyze my current resource quantities and values:\nWheat: 15 (Value 6) - Moderate quantity, low value.\nWood: 17 (Value 9) - High quantity, low value.\nSheep: 19 (Value 13) - High quantity, moderate value.\nBrick: 12 (Value 22) - Moderate quantity, high value.\nOre: 19 (Value 39) - High quantity, very high value.\nPlayer 1's offer (9 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat) involves giving away a good chunk of my Wood surplus. While I might want to reduce Wood given its low value, getting back less value overall, and specifically giving 9 Wood for only 1 Ore and 1 Brick, isn't optimal for balancing. I have a good amount of Ore and Sheep, so maybe I could offer those for more Brick or even more Wheat to avoid having too much of one resource.\n\n**Expert 3: Opponent Profiler**\n*Step 1:* Player 1's recent offers:\n- 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore, 1 Wheat (I accepted)\n- 4 Brick -> 2 Ore (I rejected - bad value)\n- 5 Wood -> 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat (I accepted - bad value, my mistake!)\n- 9 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat (Current offer)\nPlayer 1 clearly wants to acquire Sheep and Wheat, and seems willing to offload Wood and sometimes Brick. They might be trying to get rid of Wood because it's a low-value item for them, or they have a surplus. Their requests for Ore and Brick indicate they value them. The current offer (9 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat) looks like another attempt to offload Wood for valuable resources. I should deny this as it's not favorable to me.\n\n---\n**Expert 1: Value Maximizer**\n*Step 2:* Confirm rejection of Player 1's offer, then formulate a counter-offer that guarantees a positive value gain for me. I have plenty of Sheep and Ore, both valuable resources. I also have a lot of Wood that I could trade if I get good value back. My goal is to get more Brick, as it has a good value and my quantity is moderate, or even more Ore.\nI could offer low-value items for high-value items. For example, offering Wood or Wheat for Brick or Ore. Or, if Player 1 truly values Sheep, I could offer Sheep for an even better return of Brick/Ore/Wheat.\n\n**Expert 2: Resource Balancer**\n*Step 2:* Reject the current offer. I have a relatively good quantity of Ore (19) and Sheep (19). Wood is also high (17). Brick (12) and Wheat (15) are moderate. I should consider offering a combination of my high-quantity, lower-value resources (Wood, Wheat) for higher-value ones (Brick, Ore), or even trade some Sheep for Brick if the ratio is favorable. I want to avoid situations like the last accepted trade where I lost value.\n\n**Expert 3: Opponent Profiler**\n*Step 2:* Reject the current offer from Player 1. Given Player 1's consistent attempts to acquire Sheep and Wheat, and their willingness to offer Wood, I can use this information. I could try to offer them some Sheep or Wheat (but at a good exchange rate for me) in exchange for Brick or Ore, knowing they seem to have a demand for these. Perhaps they have excess Brick or Ore that they might be willing to part with for their desired Sheep/Wheat.\n\n---\n[Deny]\n---\n**Expert 1: Value Maximizer**\n*Step 3:* Given that Player 1 appears to be shedding Wood, and wants Sheep and Wheat, I will offer a small amount of Sheep for high-value Brick and Ore. I have 19 Sheep, losing a few won't hurt.\nA good offer might be 2 Sheep (value 26) for 1 Brick (value 22) and 1 Wheat (value 6). This is a net gain of 2 on paper for me (26-22-6 = -2) but could lead to bigger trades. Oh wait, this is a loss of 2. I need a gain.\n\nLet's try to gain value. I want Brick and Ore.\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (value 26) for 1 Brick (value 22) and 1 Ore (value 39), it's a huge loss for me.\nLet's think about offers that give me a clear value increase and exploit Player 1's known desires.\nIf Player 1 wants Sheep and Wheat, I can give them that, but I must get *more* value in return.\nOffer: 3 Wheat (value 18) -> 1 Brick (value 22). Net gain of 4. This seems reasonable. I have 15 Wheat.\nOr 2 Wood (value 18) -> 1 Brick (value 22). Net gain of 4. I have plenty of Wood.\n\n**Expert 2: Resource Balancer**\n*Step 3:* I'm still strong on Ore and Sheep, and have a fair amount of Wood and Wheat. Brick is decent but I could use more. Let's try to trade away some of my lower-value, higher-quantity resources for higher-value resources. Wheat and Wood are good candidates to offer.\nI'll try to get more Brick.\nOffer: 3 Wood (value 27) -> 1 Brick (value 22), 1 Wheat (value 6). Net gain for me of 1. This is marginal.\nLet's try to get Ore.\nOffer: 3 Sheep (value 39) -> 1 Ore (value 39) and 1 Wheat (value 6). Net gain of 6. This might be too much for Player 1.\nConsider Player 1's apparent desire for Sheep and Wheat. Could I offer them these high-demand items for a favorable exchange?\nOffer: 2 Sheep (value 26) + 2 Wheat (value 12) -> 2 Brick (value 44). Net gain of 6. This seems good and offers what Player 1 wants. My Sheep and Wheat quantities are high enough.\n\n**Expert 3: Opponent Profiler**\n*Step 3:* Player 1 wants Sheep and Wheat, and is trying to offload Wood. I can make an offer where I give them a modest amount of Sheep/Wheat in exchange for a high-value item like Brick or Ore, ensuring I gain value. I need to tempt them enough to accept.\nMy earlier good trade was 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore, 1 Wheat (value gain 50!). This suggests Player 1 is willing to pay high for Sheep/Ore/Wheat.\nLet's try to get more Brick, as it is a good intermediary value item.\nOffer: 2 Sheep (value 26) -> 1 Brick (value 22) and 1 Wheat (value 6). Wait, this is a loss for me.\nI need to offer something Player 1 wants, for something I want, with a positive value difference.\nWhat if I offer a mix of items they want, for items I want.\nOffer: 1 Sheep (value 13) + 1 Wheat (value 6) -> 1 Brick (value 22).\nValue offered: 19. Value requested: 22. Net gain of 3. This is small but positive and caters to their known needs. I have 19 Sheep and 15 Wheat, so this is sustainable.\n\n---\n**Player 0's decision based on Expert advice:**\nAll experts agree on denying the current offer. The Value Maximizer and Opponent Profiler both suggest offering a combination that caters to Player 1's apparent desire for Sheep and Wheat while gaining value for me, specifically targeting Brick. The Resource Balancer also aligns with this strategy.\n\nConsidering the offers:\n- Expert 1 (Value Maximizer): 3 Wheat (18) -> 1 Brick (22). **Net gain of 4.**\n- Expert 2 (Resource Balancer): 2 Sheep (26) + 2 Wheat (12) -> 2 Brick (44). **Net gain of 6.** This offers both resources P1 seems keen on.\n- Expert 3 (Opponent Profiler): 1 Sheep (13) + 1 Wheat (6) -> 1 Brick (22). **Net gain of 3.** This is a smaller trade but still positive.\n\nThe offer from Expert 2 seems promising as it offers a higher net gain and provides Player 1 with more of the resources they seem to want (Sheep and Wheat). Let's go with that.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",
