      "response": "### Expert Analysis: Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nThree experts collaborate to advise Player 0. Each provides one step of reasoning per round, sharing insights before proceeding. Experts leave if they realize their approach is flawed.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Expert 1: Value Optimization Specialist**  \n*Focus: Maximize immediate value gain using Player 0\u2019s resource valuations.*  \n**Step 1:**  \n\"Our resources have fixed values per unit (Wheat: 6, Wood: 12, Sheep: 16, Brick: 25, Ore: 33). To increase total value, trade low-value resources for high-value ones. Wheat (6) is worst; Ore (33) is best. Optimal trade: *10 Wheat for 4 Ore*. We lose 60 value but gain 132\u2014net +72. Proposal: [Offer: 10 Wheat -> 4 Ore].\"  \n\n**Step 2 (after seeing others' inputs):**  \n\"Expert 2\u2019s mutual-benefit argument makes sense\u2014my offer is too aggressive (low acceptance chance). But Expert 3\u2019s 10 Wheat for 3 Ore only yields +33. Compromise: *10 Wheat for 3 Ore and 1 Wood*. Value given: 60 + 12 = 72; value received: 99; net +27. However, adding Wood reduces gain unnecessarily. Revised: stick with [Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Ore] for +33 gain. Still safer than original.\"  \n\n**Step 3 (consensus building):**  \n\"Expert 2\u2019s 5 Wheat for 2 Ore (gain +36) is strong\u2014high acceptance probability. If accepted, we can repeat it later with remaining Wheat. No flaw in this; my initial offer was overambitious. *I adopt Expert 2\u2019s recommendation.*\"  \n\n---\n\n#### **Expert 2: Negotiation Dynamics Expert**  \n*Focus: Prioritize mutually beneficial offers for high acceptance rates.*  \n**Step 1:**  \n\"Player 0\u2019s valuation is irrelevant to others\u2014trades must benefit *both* parties. Market dynamics suggest valuations differ (e.g., a player needing Wheat might value it higher). Optimal: *5 Wheat for 2 Ore*. Player 0 gains 36 (66 - 30). Opponent gains if they value Wheat >9.9/unit and Ore <25/unit (plausible: Wheat at 10, Ore at 20 \u2192 opponent gains 10). Proposal: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Ore].\"  \n\n**Step 2 (after seeing others' inputs):**  \n\"Expert 1\u2019s 10 Wheat for 4 Ore would lose 72 value for an opponent\u2014they\u2019ll reject it. Expert 3\u2019s *all-in* approach ignores acceptance risk. My offer remains best: 5 Wheat for 2 Ore has asymmetric appeal (low-value Wheat for high-value Ore suits both sides). *No change needed.*\"  \n\n**Step 3 (validation):**  \n\"Expert 1 conceded; Expert 3 agrees multiple small trades are safer. This offer maximizes *expected* value: +36 gain at 70%+ acceptance chance beats rare +72. *Final endorsement: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Ore].*\"  \n\n---\n\n#### **Expert 3: Strategic Resource Allocator**  \n*Focus: Balance short-term gains with long-term flexibility.*  \n**Step 1:**  \n\"Wheat is low-value (6) and excess (10 units), but holding *some* ensures future trade options. Trading all 10 risks missing better later opportunities. Propose *10 Wheat for 3 Ore*: net +33 gain. Retains optionality\u2014Ore is high-value (33), and we keep Wood/Sheep for diversification.\"  \n\n**Step 2 (after seeing others' inputs):**  \n\"Expert 1\u2019s +72 fantasy ignores reality; opponents won\u2019t accept lopsided deals. Expert 2\u2019s *5 Wheat for 2 Ore* is smarter: gain +36 *and* preserve 5 Wheat for future trades. Aligns with 10-turn game\u2014small frequent trades beat risky single moves. *Adopt this approach.*\"  \n\n**Step 3 (refinement):**  \n\"Splitting Wheat into two trades (5 now, 5 later) could yield +72 total if both succeed. First trade tests market appetite; if rejected, we adjust. Expert 2\u2019s offer is optimal first move. *Support: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Ore].*\"  \n\n---\n\n### Conclusion  \nAll experts converge on **[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Ore]** as the optimal first move:  \n- **Value gain**: +36 (from 1,522 \u2192 1,558 if accepted).  \n- **High acceptance probability**: Mutually beneficial under common valuation differences (e.g., opponent needs Wheat).  \n- **Strategic safety**: Preserves 5 Wheat for future trades, leveraging the game\u2019s 10-turn limit.  \n\nExperts unanimously recommend this offer.

      "response": "[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 1: My role is to evaluate the intrinsic value of each resource based on current holdings and market efficiency.  \n- Current total value:  \n  - Wheat: 10 \u00d7 6 = 60  \n  - Wood: 19 \u00d7 12 = 228  \n  - Sheep: 18 \u00d7 16 = 288  \n  - Brick: 22 \u00d7 25 = 550  \n  - Ore: 12 \u00d7 33 = 396  \n  \u2192 Total = 60 + 228 + 288 + 550 + 396 = **1,522**  \n- Ore has the highest individual value (33), followed by Brick (25). Wheat is lowest (6).  \n- I note that Player 1 is offering 5 Brick (value 125) for 10 Wheat (value 60). That\u2019s a net gain of 65 in raw value\u2014potentially beneficial *if* we have surplus Wheat.  \n\n[Expert 2: Inventory Flow Analyst]  \nStep 1: I analyze inventory dynamics and opportunity cost.  \n- We have 10 Wheat\u2014minimal stock. Trading all 10 away eliminates Wheat buffer, which could hinder future trades or developments requiring balanced portfolios.  \n- We have 22 Brick\u2014high stock. Giving 5 Brick reduces surplus without crippling availability.  \n- But Player 1 wants **10 Wheat \u2192 5 Brick**, while earlier *we* tried to trade 10 Wheat for 4 Ore\u2014showing we value Ore more than Brick.  \n- Therefore, accepting a trade that gives up high-opportunity Wheat for less-desired Brick seems suboptimal.  \n- Caution advised.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 1: I assess behavioral patterns and counterparty incentives.  \n- Player 1 rejected our initial offer (10 Wheat \u2192 4 Ore). Why? Possibly because 4 Ore is too high for 10 Wheat, or they lack Ore.  \n- Now, Player 1 offers 5 Brick for 10 Wheat\u2014an unusual move. Since Brick is valuable (25) and we\u2019re rich in it, this may be a bid to exploit our surplus.  \n- But they\u2019re *giving* 5 Brick (125 value) for 10 Wheat (60 value)\u2014a generous offer unless they\u2019re low on Wheat or trying to manipulate inventory flow.  \n- Their reversal suggests desperation or strategic bluffing. Need to probe.  \n- However, if they\u2019re low on Wheat, we might leverage that in future trades.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 2: Re-evaluating trade value.  \n- The offer: -10 Wheat (+60 value loss), +5 Brick (+125 value gain), net: **+65 value**.  \n- Even though we value Ore more, this still increases total valuation.  \n- However\u2014strategic value matters: Ore enables higher-tier advancements. Brick may be less scarce in market context.  \n- But *we have 22 Brick*\u2014well above average. Trading 5 is feasible. Losing *all* Wheat limits flexibility.  \n- Proposed compromise: Offer *partial* Wheat (e.g., 5) for better return.\n\n[Expert 2: Inventory Flow Analyst]  \nStep 2: Assess trade impact on future options.  \n- Depleting Wheat to 0 is risky. Even low-value resources are needed for balanced trade portfolios.  \n- Receiving more Brick (now 27) increases already high concentration\u2014overstocking reduces marginal utility.  \n- Better to trade excess Brick *away* for higher-value or scarce resources (e.g., Ore).  \n- Therefore, **we should not accept 10 Wheat \u2192 5 Brick as-is**.  \n- Instead, counter with: Offer 5 Brick \u2192 Request 3 Ore or similar.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 2: Detect intentions and shape response.  \n- Player 1 may be inventory-constrained on Wheat. Their willingness to accept 10 Wheat suggests scarcity.  \n- We can exploit this: instead of accepting their offer directly, flip the script\u2014**offer a small amount of Wheat for higher-value return**.  \n- Example: Offer 5 Wheat \u2192 Request 2 Ore. They may accept, preserving some Wheat while gaining vital Ore.  \n- This builds trust and keeps dialogue open.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 3: Synthesizing.  \n- Net value gain is tempting, but resource balance trumps short-term gain.  \n- Best path: **Do not accept the current offer**.  \n- Instead, **make a counter-offer** that uses *some* Wheat to acquire **Ore**.\n\n[Expert 2: Inventory Flow Analyst]  \nStep 3: Confirming\u2014reject offer. We must preserve Wheat diversity and target Ore acquisition.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 3: Recommend counter-offer to test Player 1\u2019s limits.

Brick (25) is high value; they\u2019re willing to spend it on Wheat \u2014 so Wheat must be *very* valuable to them.\n\nThis is our leverage.\n\nInstead of accepting their weak Sheep offer, we should **counter with a profitable Wheat-for-Ore deal**.\n\nWe have 10 Wheat \u2014 we can afford to trade some.  \nBest use: get Ore.\n\nLet\u2019s make a new offer: **Offer 6 Wheat \u2192 Request 2 Ore**\n\nCost to us: 6\u00d76 = 36  \nValue gained: 2\u00d733 = 66  \nNet gain: +30 \u2014 excellent.\n\nAnd since Player 1 clearly desires Wheat, this should be attractive to them.\n\nBut wait \u2014 will they accept? Possibly better to start slightly more generous to close the deal.\n\nAlternative: **Offer 7 Wheat \u2192 Request 2 Ore**  \nStill, cost = 42, gain = 66 \u2192 net +24. Still good.\n\nOr, flip it: can we get *more*?\n\nThey offered 3 Sheep for 2 Wheat \u2014 so their internal Wheat value is > (3\u00d7Sheep)/2 = 48 / 2 = 24 per Wheat? That can\u2019t be right. More likely, they\u2019re bluffing or testing.\n\nBetter to stick with value-positive trades.\n\nBest path: **Make a new offer: 5 Wheat \u2192 2 Ore**, same as before. They rejected it last time \u2014 but we can retry if no better options.\n\nBut we already did that. Now, to break deadlock, perhaps bundle.\n\nNew idea: **Bundle Wheat with low need for us but high trade appeal.**\n\nWe have plenty of Brick (22) and Wood (19). But Brick is high value (25) \u2014 don\u2019t give it freely.\n\nWait \u2014 they offered Brick for Wheat. They *have* Brick and want Wheat.\n\nSo: **They want Wheat, will trade Brick or Sheep for it.**\n\nBut we don\u2019t want Brick \u2014 we already have 22. We want Ore.\n\nNo sign that Player 1 has Ore or wants to trade it.\n\nHmm.\n\nIs there a way to **trade Wheat \u2192 Sheep**, at least, to build toward a three-player trade later? But this current offer gives only 3 Sheep for 2 Wheat \u2014 absurdly favorable to them.\n\nNo. This is a trap.\n\nBest move: **Deny. Then make a new offer: 6 Wheat \u2192 Request 1 Ore and 1 Sheep**  \nValue: Pay 36 \u2192 Gain 33 + 16 = 49 \u2192 Net +13. Still positive.\n\nOr: **Offer 10 Wheat \u2192 Request 3 Ore**  \nPay 60 \u2192 Gain 99 \u2192 Net +39 \u2014 excellent.\n\nLet\u2019s aim high.\n\nFinal thought: **We should [Deny] this offer. Then make a strong counter.**\n\nCurrent advice: **[Deny]**",

      "response": "I\u2019m starting the negotiation mid-game (after 5 exchanges that all ended in rejection) and the clock is running: five more turns until the game ends.  \nBecause of that, I want to assemble advisers who focus on quick, high-impact gains rather than long-game speculation.\n\nChosen panels of advisers  \n1. The Value Analyst \u2013 specializes in converting every resource into my own point system and finding strictly positive net-gain moves.  \n2. The Exchange Prospector \u2013 looks at relative quantities and market-level ratios to identify mutually-priceable deals Player 0 might finally prefer.  \n3. The Turn Tracker \u2013 enforces scarcity-of-time and ensures we don\u2019t get trapped in endless counter-offers.\n\n[Turn 6 \u2013 Adviser Step 1]\n\nValue Analyst:  \nMy point ledger right now  \n- Wheat 12@-6.    Net -72  \n- Wood 16@-10.   Net -160  \n- Sheep 9@-13.   Net -117  \n- Brick 16@-29.  Net -464  \n- Ore 19@-32.    Net -608  \n\nAny deal must yield strictly more than zero incremental value under these numbers.  \nValue weight of 1 Brick = 29, 1 Ore = 32. Profit margin on an Ore \u2192 Brick swap is tiny, but my currently highest-valued resource (Ore) is also my largest stockpile, so I\u2019m actually willing to part with small packets of Ore to round up lower-valued goods, provided I clear at least +1 value each.  \nTry a \u201cslivers of Ore\u201d package.\n\nExchange Prospector:  \nLooking at prior rejections, Player 0 did offer Wheat-for-Ore at 5:2, then at 10:4 \u2013 both rejected by me.  \nThey apparently want Ore quite badly, but at 2.5 Wheat per Ore. I want Wheat at \u22640.5 Ore per Wheat (since 4 Ore \u2264 10 Wheat value-wise). The direct conversion gap is 5\u00d7 apart, so open trades that give them Ore more cheaply (say 1:1 Wheat-for-Ore) may finally secure a mutually acceptable deal. I can spare 4-6 Ore to pick up 4-6 Wheat and still net positive value.\n\nTurn Tracker:  \nFive turns left. Two have already gone by with zero completed trades. Let\u2019s not blow another one.\n\n[Turn 6 \u2013 Adviser Step 2]\n\nValue Analyst:  \nCompute smallest Ore chunk that gives me \u2265 +1 value.  \nIf I give 2 Ore (value 64) and take 5 Wheat (value 30 \u2192 5\u00d76 = 30) I lose 34. Bad.  \nNeed 6 Wheat for 2 Ore to break even (value 36), which is exactly 3 Wheat/Ore. That isn\u2019t on their past offers, but it\u2019s still far below their previously-stated 2.5 Wheat / Ore. Maybe they cap at 5:2 (2.5 ratio). 5 Wheat = 30 points; cost of 2 Ore = 64 \u2192 net -34. Untenable.  \nOffset Ore loss by adding Sheep or Wood with positive margins.\n\nExchange Prospector:  \nLet\u2019s propose a combo where Player 0 perceives \u201cOre bargain\u201d but my surplus Brick actually carries the value load. Could ask them to supply Wheat plus minor extra in return for Ore+Brick.\n\nTurn Tracker:  \nGo package-style on this turn itself.\n\n[Turn 6 \u2013 Adviser Step 3]\n\nConsensus emerges: bring in a 3\u2013party bundle anchored on their strong pursuit of Ore, but label it as \u201cBrick for Wheat\u201d while sneaking in an Ore.\n\nProposed move:  \nOffer:  \nGive 2 Brick (58 points) + 2 Ore (64 points) \u2192 Receive 7 Wheat (42 points) + 1 Wood (10 points)  \nNet to me: -58-64+42+10 = -70 (negative) \u2013 kill that.\n\nTweak: reduce Ore to 1, Brick to 2, but demand 5 Wheat.  \n- Offer: 2 Brick + 1 Ore \u2192 5 Wheat  \nValue to me: Brick 58 + Ore 32 = 90 ; 5 Wheat = 30 ; net -60 \u2013 still worse.\n\nTry 2 Ore \u2192 3 Wheat (I lose) and ask for side-item.\n\nShift target: acquire more volume of low-tier goods rather than squeezing margins \u2013 stack Wheat/Sheep until marginal value to me flips positive.\n\nSimpler idea: pick up 4 Wheat at lowest feasible cost using my pile of Sheep where my ratio is already high.\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep (value 26) \u2192 3 Wheat (value 18) ; net = -8 still not acceptable.\n\nWe\u2019re stuck. Let\u2019s reverse: sell my Brick which I value at 29 to gain Wood or Ore.\n\nOffer 3: 1 Brick \u2192 3 Wood (value 30) \u2013 net +1, lowest margin gain possible, but Player 0 rarely sends Wood offers. Scrap.\n\nValue Analyst leaves only when gain \u2265 +1 with high probability. Let\u2019s instead pivot strictly to pure brick-for-sheep where Brick 29 < Sheep 39 absolute, yet in messaging I frame it as \u201ceven\u201d.\n\nOffer construct: I give 1 Brick (29) + 1 Ore (32) \u2192 get 2 Sheep (52).  \nNet to me: -29-32+52 = -9 ouch. Never.\n\nTry 1 Brick \u2192 1 Sheep. Net: +10. Decent.\n\nExchange Prospector: Player 0 historical behavior often values Wheat heavily and Sheep lightly. Direct Brick-for-Sheep at 1:1 might clear.\n\nTurn Tracker: Burn no more thoughts, put an offer out this turn.\n\n[Final output for Turn 6]\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Sheep]",

Trading 1 Brick for 1 Sheep is a loss for us. Do **not** accept.\n\n[Expert C - Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 1: Assessing Player 1's behavior:  \n- Quick succession of small offers suggests impatience or probing.  \n- First counter with 5 Brick for 10 Wheat implies high demand for Wheat.  \n- Now offering 1 Brick for 1 Sheep \u2013 possibly fishing for irrational acceptance.  \n- May be low on Brick or trying to devalue it.  \n\nPlayer 0 appears eager to convert Wheat into Ore (high-value resource).  \nBest strategy: use excess Wheat (lowest value/quantity ratio) as bait, aim to extract Ore or high-value items.\n\n\u2014\n\n[Expert A - Value Optimization Specialist]  \nStep 2: Evaluate Player 1's current offer: 1 Brick \u2192 1 Sheep  \n- We lose 25 - 16 = 9 value per trade.  \n- Strong **rejection** advised. We should never trade down in value without strategic gain.  \nBut we must make a counteroffer soon.

But note: they *have* Brick.  \nWe have 22 Brick \u2014 high quantity, high value. But if we can trade surplus for Ore, better.  \nPlayer 1 seems Brick-constrained. May be willing to trade Ore for Wheat?  \nOur prior 5 Wheat \u2192 2 Ore was fair (60 \u2192 66 value). Was rejected. Maybe they want more Wheat?\n\nTry scaling up: 10 Wheat \u2192 3 Ore? Still favorable for us (60 \u2192 99). Or add small bonus to entice.\n\n[Expert C - Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 2: Player 1 rejected 5 Wheat \u2192 2 Ore. But accepted trading *up* in value when offering 5 Brick \u2192 10 Wheat.  \nSo: Player 1 values Wheat highly. May be starving for it.  \nWe should **leverage our 10 Wheat** as a bundle. Scarcity perception: instead of small trades, offer a \"package\".  \n\nNew tactic: Propose 10 Wheat \u2192 3 Ore. Feels like a closure. \"Bulk for bulk.\"  \nAvoid breaking into small pieces \u2014 makes Wheat seem more abundant and less valuable.\n\n\u2014\n\n[Expert A - Value Optimization Specialist]  \nStep 3: Final calculation.  \nCurrent best move: Offer 10 Wheat \u2192 3 Ore  \n- We give: 10 \u00d7 6 = 60  \n- We gain: 3 \u00d7 33 = 99  \n- Net gain: +39 value  \nEven 2 Ore (66) is worth it, but 3 makes it more enticing as a \"round\" trade.\n\nWe still have zero Ore incoming.

Let's analyze Player 0's current inventory and values:\n\n- Wheat: 10 units \u00d7 6 = 60  \n- Wood: 19 \u00d7 12 = 228  \n- Sheep: 18 \u00d7 16 = 288  \n- Brick: 22 \u00d7 25 = 550  \n- Ore: 12 \u00d7 33 = 396  \n\nTotal current value: 60 + 228 + 288 + 550 + 396 = **1,522**\n\nOre has the highest individual value (33), followed by Brick (25), Sheep (16), Wood (12), and Wheat (6).  \nSince Wheat is lowest value, it's optimal to trade away Wheat for higher-value resources, especially Ore or Brick.  \nHowever, previous offers trading 10 Wheat for 3\u20134 Ore were rejected. Player 1 may undervalue Wheat or want different ratios.\n\n[Expert 2: Behavioral Trade Analyst]  \nStep 1: I analyze the counterparty\u2019s behavior. Player 1 has:\n- Repeatedly rejected offers of Wheat for Ore.\n- Made two identical offers: 5 Brick \u2192 10 Wheat.\n- Also offered 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Wheat and 1 Brick \u2192 1 Sheep.\n\nThis suggests:\n- Player 1 has surplus Brick and possibly needs Wheat.\n- They value 10 Wheat at ~5 Brick (i.e., 2 Wheat = 1 Brick in their mind).\n- Small offers (1:1) indicate they might prefer balanced or incremental trades.\n\nThey consistently reject high-Ore-for-Wheat trades \u2014 likely, they don\u2019t value Wheat highly enough to give up Ore, but they *do* want Wheat, as they keep offering Brick for it.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Dynamics Expert]  \nStep 1: I focus on building trade rapport and shaping perception.  \nPlayer 0\u2019s repeated offers of Wheat \u2192 Ore suggest desperation for Ore, making Player 1 less inclined to concede.  \nPlayer 1 keeps offering Brick for Wheat \u2014 they may be\u8bd5\u63a2 (testing) whether Player 0 will accept a fair market trade.\n\nCurrent market inference:\n- 10 Wheat \u2248 5 Brick \u2192 so 2 Wheat = 1 Brick (value ratio: 12 vs 25 \u2192 favorable for us if we give Wheat)\n- But 1 Ore (33) is worth more than 1 Brick (25), so we should avoid trading Ore for Brick.\n\nWe should pivot: stop offering large Wheat\u2192Ore trades. Instead, accept or mirror Player 1\u2019s pattern: trade Wheat for Brick, which is *still* a net gain (giving low-value Wheat, getting high-value Brick).\n\n[Expert 1: Value Maximization Strategist]  \nStep 2: Re-evaluating \u2014 even if we can't get Ore, trading Wheat for Brick is still value-positive.\n\nExample: Giving 10 Wheat (value 60) for 5 Brick (value 125) \u2192 net gain +65.\n\nOur last offer: 10 Wheat \u2192 3 Ore (value 99) was good, but rejected.  \nPlayer 1 might not have Ore to spare.\n\nBetter to accept their offer: 5 Brick \u2192 10 Wheat?  \nNo \u2014 that\u2019s what they\u2019re offering to us. We would give 10 Wheat (60) and gain 5 Brick (125). That\u2019s a +65 value gain.\n\nWait \u2014 we\u2019ve been rejecting it. Why?\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Dynamics Expert]  \nStep 2: We rejected their 5 Brick \u2192 10 Wheat offer earlier, possibly due to desire for Ore. But Ore isn't forthcoming.\n\nRejecting favorable offers damages goodwill. Player 1 may stop making offers.\n\nWe should **accept their current offer**: 5 Brick for 10 Wheat.\n\nNet effect:\n- Lose 10 Wheat (60 value)\n- Gain 5 Brick (125 value)\n- Net gain: +65\n- Our total value becomes 1,522 \u2192 1,462 (after losing Wheat) + 125 = **1,587**\n\nAlso, we free up Wheat, which is low-value and possibly in excess.\n\n[Expert 2: Behavioral Trade Analyst]  \nStep 2: Player 1 has made the same offer twice: 5 Brick \u2192 10 Wheat.  \nIn negotiation psychology, repeated offers signal importance or openness.\n\nThey may accept if we reciprocate or accept. We\u2019ve rejected once \u2014 rejecting again may signal disinterest, ending trade flow.\n\nGiven our failed attempts to get Ore, this is the best live opportunity.\n\n[Expert 1: Value Maximization Strategist]  \nStep 3: Correction \u2014 I miscalculated.  \nCurrent total value: 1,522  \nAfter accepting 5 Brick \u2192 10 Wheat:\n- Remove 10 Wheat: -60\n- Add 5 Brick: +125\n- New total: 1,522 - 60 + 125 = **1,587**\n\nYes, +65 gain. Optimal under current constraints.\n\nWe should **accept the offer**.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 10 Wheat] was made by Player 1 to Player 0.  \nWe have not yet responded.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[Accept]",

Problem: total EV increase small (+3).  \nOption B2: [Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Ore \u2192 3 Sheep] yields larger EV bump (Sheep jump from 13 to 14-15 still okay), yet Player 0 already rejected close packaging resembling this.  \nConclusion: Brick still the cleanest excess to move; dual-item bundling with Ore looks resilient.\n\nExpert C  \nStep 2 \u2013 Synthesize pattern and salience.  \nPlayer 0 accepted 5 Brick only when the return was ultra-compressed (10 Wheat). A multi-unit Ore ask will likely be rejected unless back-loaded with Wheat. A symmetric trade coded in Brick-Wheat ratio invites acceptance. Refinement: sweet-spot ratio may be 1 Brick : 2 Wheat (last acceptance) or 5 Brick : 10 Wheat. So I should test the 1-for-2 threshold again, but this time ask for an extra marginal unit to pressure acceptance: make it 6 Brick \u2192 12 Wheat.
