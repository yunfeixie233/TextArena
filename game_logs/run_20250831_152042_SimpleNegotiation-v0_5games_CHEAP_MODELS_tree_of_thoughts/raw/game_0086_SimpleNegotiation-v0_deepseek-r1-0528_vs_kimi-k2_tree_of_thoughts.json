      "response": "### Expert Discussion on the Negotiation Game\n\nI'll assume the roles of three experts with different perspectives to advise on the trade decision. Each expert will write one step of their thinking at a time, building from their expertise. The experts are:\n1. **Value Maximizer**: Focuses on immediate value gains based on per-unit valuations.\n2. **Resource Strategist**: Considers supply and demand synergies and long-term implications.\n3. **Negotiation Tactician**: Focuses on practical trading psychology and likelihood of acceptance.\n\nThese experts will deliberate over three rounds of discussion.\n\n**Round 1: Initial Analysis**\n- **Value Maximizer**: \"Wheat has the lowest per-unit value (6) and we have a surplus (23). Trading it for high-value resources (like Brick: 22 or Ore: 39) is ideal. Target a net value gain per trade of at least 10. Don't trade Wood (11), Sheep (13), or Ore (39), as we\u2019re low in Wood and higher-value resources.\"\n- **Resource Strategist**: \"Agreed. Wheat is abundant but unimportant. Excess could be risky if values change later. Ore (39) is the peak target, but hard to get with in-value trades today. Brick (22) is a safer start\u2014we have 15, so more won\u2019t dilute strategic needs. Avoid trading Sheep\u2014it\u2019s moderately valued but has potential for token trades.\"\n- **Negotiation Tactician**: \"First offer must be realistic to avoid rejection. Since no opponent data, base choices on common scenarios: players undervalue surpluses. Offering Wheat for higher-value resources makes sense. Start small: 3\u20134 Wheat for 1 Brick has a shot at acceptance and builds rapport for bigger asks like Ore later. Avoid Ore bids now\u2014high value makes players protective.\"\n\n**Round 2: Evaluating Offers**\n- **Value Maximizer**: \"2. Proposing 3 Wheat for 1 Brick gives 18 value out and 22 in\u2014net +4. That\u2019s acceptable. Or 4 Wheat (24) + 1 Sheep (13) for 1 Ore (39): 37 out, 39 in\u2014a small net +2. But Sheep trading is risky: losing 13 unit-value on a middle-resource could hurt if Ore gains dry up. Stick to Wheat-heavy offers.\"\n- **Resource Strategist**: \"2. Brick is better than Ore here. We have 15 Brick versus only 12 Ore; it\u2019s less critical and we can hand it. 3 Wheat (18) to 1 Brick (22) gains us +4 and leverages surplus. Plus, it avoids touching Sheep\u2014which has synergy in potential bundles but low-medium value. Ore trades wait until we test the market with brick.\"\n- **Negotiation Tactician**: \"2. Prioritize likability. Players reject lopsided offers, so over-asking for Ore (e.g., 6 Wheat) fails unless we overpay, which hurts our value. 3 Wheat for 1 Brick feels 'fair': humans misvalue small quantity differences. If denied, we gather data for tweaking. Always details matter: be with Brick first to stability perception.\"\n\n**Round 3: Consensus and Recommendations**\n- **Value Maximizer**: \"3. Final Recommendation: Offer  Wheat for Brick only. Make it low-risk to cement gains: 3 Wheat (18) \u2194 1 Brick (22) nets +4. Endorse.\"\n- **Resource Strategist\": \"3. Long-term agree. Wheat depletes safely, Sheep untouched, Brick gains modestly. This sets us up later targeting Ore. Perfect.\"\n- **Negotiation Tactician\": \"3. Lower rejection risk, raises opponent goodwill and avoids seeming greedy. Proposal: [Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]. Execute now to test response. If accepted, great; if denied, we adapt.\"\n\n**Final Decision**:  \nBased on expert consensus, Player 0 will propose:  \n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick] to bait for small net value gains in early trades.",

I should aim to keep Brick above 10 while shedding some of my over-supplied Sheep and Wheat.\n\n**Market Reader**: Player 0 just gave away 2 Brick for 3 Ore.

Net: **+12 value**. Immediate gain supports acceptance.  \n\n**Step 2:** Risk assessment.  \n- Brick loss reduces stock to 10 (still abundant). Ore gain increases highest-value asset (post-trade Ore total: 17). No downside if this aligns with long-term accumulation of high-value resources.  \n\n### Expert 2 (Resource Strategist)\n**Step 1:** Scarcity and future trade utility.  \n- Ore (value 39) is your top-priority resource. Acquiring more without loss of Wood/Sheep/Ore is ideal.  \n- Brick (value 22) is less critical. 10 remain post-trade, sufficient for future deals. Wheat (23 units, low value) is better to offload than Brick. Opportunity cost is low.  \n\n**Step 2:** Player 1's pattern suggests Brick demand.  \n- They rejected your Wheat-for-Brick offer earlier but proposed Ore-for-Brick twice. Leverage this! Next, counter with Wheat or Sheep if they seek more Brick. Accept now to encourage deals favoring high-value Ore.  \n\n### Expert 3 (Behavioral Analyst)  \n**Step 1:** Decode opponent incentives.  \n- Player 1 values Brick highly (originally rejected 1 Brick for 3 Wheat, now offering Ore twice). They might be building (e.g., settlements requiring Brick) or have an Ore surplus. Exploit this.  \n- Accepting signals openness to future trades, potentially triggering more favorable offers. Refusing risks halting negotiations.  \n\n**Step 2:** Accept fast to maintain momentum.  \n- If Ore exceeds your needs, trade it later for Wood/Sheep. Brick hoarding is inefficient: Wood is scarcer for you (5 left, value 11), but Ore\u2019s value dominates.  \n\n---  \n**Consensus:** All experts agree\u2014**accept the trade**.

Too much further brick skews risk. I should seek diversification while still targeting marginal value gains.\n\n- **Step 2** Thought: Wood, valued 8, is currently scarce (only 9). Wood/Brick demand strongly from other players; a 2-Wood-for-3-Brick swap would improve port-shipping potential. Net value change: (2 Wood got \u2192 16) \u2013 (3 Brick given \u2192 84) = \u201368; this is negative. Reject.

      "response": "### Expert Analysis for Trade Decision\n\n**Expert 1 (Value Analyst):**  \nI focus strictly on net value changes. Our current resources are: Wheat (23, 6 ea), Wood (5, 11 ea), Sheep (13, 13 ea), Brick (10, 22 ea), Ore (17, 39 ea). Total value: (23\u00d76) + (5\u00d711) + (13\u00d713) + (10\u00d722) + (17\u00d739) = 138 + 55 + 169 + 220 + 663 = 1,245. Player 1's offer is to give 3 Ore (value: 3\u00d739 = 117) for 6 Brick (value: 6\u00d722 = 132). Net change: 117 - 132 = -15 (a loss). This reduces total value. **Recommendation: Reject to avoid value loss.**\n\n**Expert 2 (Resource Strategist):**  \nI consider long-term resource utility and risk. Ore is high-value (39), and we have a healthy stock (17), but Brick is also critical (22, only 10 left). Player 1 is aggressively targeting Brick, but we must preserve resources that generate the most value. Trading 6 Brick (a large 60% of our stock) for 3 Ore risks leaving us Brick-poor for future opportunities. Since the game ends soon and no follow-up trades are possible, we should safeguard Brick. Player 1 has a pattern of offering unfavorable Ore/Brick ratios (e.g., forced losses or breakeven in past trades). **Recommendation: Reject to conserve Brick for higher-value deals.**\n\n**Expert 3 (Negotiation Specialist):**  \nI analyze Player 1's behavior. They have made 5 offers: 4 for Brick using Ore/Wheat as leverage. All accepted trades marginally benefited us (e.g., Turn 2: +64 net value; Turn 4: +12 net value), but recent offers (Turn 6, 8, 10) have escalating demands for Brick (from 4 to 6) with poorer returns. This final offer is the worst ratio yet (6 Brick:3 Ore vs. our fair value threshold of ~5.5 Brick:3 Ore). Since this is Turn 10/10, a counter-offer is impossible\u2014we only have time to respond. Accepting would reward their exploitation. **Recommendation: Reject to avoid setting a precedent, given no time for counter-negotiation.**\n\n### Consensus  \nAll experts agree: The offer (3 Ore for 6 Brick) reduces value, depletes critical Brick, and provides no strategic upside. We should **deny** it.\n\n[Deny]",
