      "response": "The game is about to begin. You are Player 1.\nThe following experts are available to advise you:\n- **The Strategist**: Focuses on long-term goals, resource diversification, and identifying high-value exchanges.\n- **The Valuator**: Specializes in calculating precise resource values and identifying profitable trades based on quantitative analysis.\n- **The Negotiator**: Focuses on understanding the opponent's likely needs, framing offers, and maximizing the perceived value of your resources.\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> Requested: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\n\n***\n\n**The Strategist:** My first step is to assess our current inventory's total value and identify resources we have in abundance versus those that are relatively scarce or highly valued. This will inform which resources we are willing to trade away and which we should aim to acquire.\n\n**The Valuator:** My first step is to calculate the current total value of our resources.\nWheat: 12 * 5 = 60\nWood: 6 * 10 = 60\nSheep: 17 * 17 = 289\nBrick: 24 * 20 = 480\nOre: 7 * 38 = 266\nTotal current value = 60 + 60 + 289 + 480 + 266 = 1155.\n\n**The Negotiator:** My first step is to analyze the opponent's offer to understand what they are seeking and what they are willing to give. This helps me infer their immediate needs and resource priorities, which is crucial for crafting counter-offers or accepting.\nPlayer 0 is offering 3 Sheep and 2 Ore, and asking for 5 Brick and 2 Sheep. They are effectively asking for 5 Brick and a net of -1 Sheep in exchange for 2 Ore.\n\n***\n\n**The Strategist:** Now, let's analyze the current offer in light of our resource distribution. We have a very high quantity of Brick (24) and Sheep (17), while our Ore (7) and Wood (6) quantities are lower. Brick is also quite valuable per unit compared to Wheat, Wood, and Sheep. Ore is our most valuable per unit resource. We should be cautious about giving up too much Ore.\n\n**The Valuator:** Let's calculate the value of Player 0's offer.\nResources offered to us: 3 Sheep + 2 Ore\n3 Sheep * 17 value/Sheep = 51\n2 Ore * 38 value/Ore = 76\nTotal value offered to us = 51 + 76 = 127\n\nResources we would give: 5 Brick + 2 Sheep\n5 Brick * 20 value/Brick = 100\n2 Sheep * 17 value/Sheep = 34\nTotal value we would give = 100 + 34 = 134\n\nThe offer is (127 - 134) = -7 in net value for us. This is a bad deal in purely quantitative terms.\n\n**The Negotiator:** Player 0 is asking for a net of 5 Brick and effectively 1 Sheep (5 Brick + 2 Sheep - 3 Sheep offered). They are offering 2 Ore. This suggests they value Ore more than Brick/Sheep, or perhaps have an abundance of Brick and Sheep or a need for Ore. Given our high quantity of Brick and Sheep, we might be positioned to fulfill their request, but the current offer is not balanced for us.\n\n***\n\n**The Strategist:** Given the current offer's negative value and our abundance of Brick and Sheep, we should consider a counter-offer. We ideally want to increase our total value, not decrease it. We also want to diversify our lower quantity resources or acquire more higher-value-per-unit resources if possible, without overpaying. Brick is a good candidate for trade as we have a large surplus.\n\n**The Valuator:** Based on the calculations, we should not accept this offer as it results in a net loss of 7 value. Any counter-offer or acceptance must result in a positive change in our total value for it to be worthwhile from a purely quantitative perspective. If we were to accept, our total value would decrease from 1155 to 1148.\n\n**The Negotiator:** Player 0 wants Brick and is willing to give up Ore and Sheep. We have a surplus of Brick and Sheep. We don't want to accept an offer that reduces our total value. We can try to modify their offer to make it profitable for us, leveraging our excess Brick. We could propose giving less Brick, or demanding more Ore, or a combination. Taking into account the Valuator's assessment, we need to ensure our proposed output value is less than or equal to our preferred input value.\n\n***\n\n**The Strategist:** We should try to leverage our surplus Brick while acquiring more valuable resources like Ore or even Wood/Wheat if the exchange rate is favorable. The current offer is not favorable. We should deny this offer and prepare a counter-offer that maintains our strategic goals.\n\n**The Valuator:** The current offer is a net loss of 7 value. We must propose a counter-offer where the value of what we receive is greater than the value of what we give. We have plenty of Brick and a fair amount of Sheep, while Ore is high value and we have less of it. We should explore scenarios where we give Brick and receive Ore, aiming for a net positive value. For example, giving 3 Brick for 2 Ore would be a 60 value outgoing for a 76 value incoming, a +16 gain.\n\n**The Negotiator:** We should deny this offer. Player 0 has indicated a need for Brick and willingness to part with Ore. We have a strong position with Brick. We can propose a revised trade focusing on getting more value from our Brick. Perhaps reducing the quantity of Brick they receive, or asking for more Ore, or asking for a different resource that benefits us more.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "In this negotiation scenario, I will utilize three different types of experts who will offer diverse perspectives and strategies to maximize the total value of resources through trading. These experts are: \n\n1. **The Market Analyst**: Focuses on market demand and supply.\n2. **The Value Optimizer**: Concentrates on the inherent value of resources and seeks to trade up for more valuable items.\n3. **The Risk Assessor**: Analyzes the risk associated with trades and looks for balanced trades that minimize losses.\n\n### Step 1: Expert Contributions\n\n**Market Analyst**: \n\"Player 0, looking at the current market, I see that Brick is in high demand as it is crucial for building and has a higher trading value than most of your resources. Focus on trading your lower-value resources, like Sheep, for Brick, as demand may lead to continuing good offers. \n\n**Value Optimizer**: \n\"You have a strong stack of Ore, which has a high value of 35. Trading 2 Ore seems fair in most scenarios, but perhaps increasing that number to 3 might fetch a better return. Consider packing them with 2 or 3 lower-value resources to enhance trade offers. \n\n**Risk Assessor**: \n\"I notice that you have rejected a trade offer already. This could set a precedent that you\u2019re not willing to trade at all. Avoid being too rigid; accepting slightly lower-value trades can lead to greater benefits later on if you can accumulate more valuable resources down the line.\"\n\n### Move Forward with a New Offer\n\nBased on my experts' insights, I will make a new offer that aims to balance my currently lower-value resources while also leveraging my valuable Ore.\n\n**New Trade Offer by Player 0**: \n\"[Offer: 3 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 5 Brick, 2 Ore]\"\n\n- Offering resources: 3 Wood and 3 Sheep (with values of 9 and 16 respectively, total = 25).\n- Requesting resources: 5 Brick and 2 Ore (with values of 26 and 35 respectively, total = 61).\n\nThis is an optimal strategy as I am trading for higher-value resources while still parting with surplus items. \n\n### Next Steps\nNow it would be crucial to wait for Player 1's response and be prepared to negotiate further, depending on their acceptance or denial of this new offer. \n\nI will continue to engage with the experts to refine further offers based on responses received.",

      "response": "Welcome to the negotiation game! I am Player 1.\nMy current resources and their values are:\n  - Wheat: 12 (Value: 5)\n  - Wood: 6 (Value: 10)\n  - Sheep: 17 (Value: 17)\n  - Brick: 24 (Value: 20)\n  - Ore: 7 (Value: 38)\n\nThe total value of my current resources is (12*5) + (6*10) + (17*17) + (24*20) + (7*38) = 60 + 60 + 289 + 480 + 266 = 1155.\n\nPlayer 0's last offer was: Offered items: 3 Wood, 3 Sheep -> Requested items: 5 Brick, 2 Ore.\nLet's analyze the value of this trade for me.\nValue of resources I would give up: (3 * Wood_Value) + (3 * Sheep_Value) = (3 * 10) + (3 * 17) = 30 + 51 = 81.\nValue of resources I would receive: (5 * Brick_Value) + (2 * Ore_Value) = (5 * 20) + (2 * 38) = 100 + 76 = 176.\nThis trade would increase my total resource value by 176 - 81 = 95. This seems like a good offer!\n\nI will consult with three experts: a 'Value Maximizer', a 'Strategic Resource Analyst', and a 'Negotiation Tactician'.\n\n***\n\n**Value Maximizer:** My primary goal is to increase the total numerical value of your resources. I will evaluate every trade offer based solely on the net change in your total value.\n\n**Strategic Resource Analyst:** I will assess how this trade impacts your overall resource portfolio, considering not just immediate value but also balance and potential future needs.\n\n**Negotiation Tactician:** I will consider Player 0's apparent preferences and past offers to anticipate their willingness to trade, aiming to secure the best possible terms for you.\n\n***\n\n**Value Maximizer:** Player 0's offer of (3 Wood, 3 Sheep) for (5 Brick, 2 Ore) has a direct value gain for you. You would be giving away 3 Wood (3 * 10 = 30) and 3 Sheep (3 * 17 = 51) for a total value of 81. You would receive 5 Brick (5 * 20 = 100) and 2 Ore (2 * 38 = 76) for a total value of 176. This results in a net gain of 176 - 81 = 95. This is a positive value transaction.\n\n**Strategic Resource Analyst:** This trade shifts away from Wood and Sheep, which are mid-to-lower value resources for you, towards Brick and Ore, which are higher value per unit. You currently have a very large quantity of Brick (24), so acquiring 5 more Brick further increases your concentration in this resource. However, increasing your Ore quantity from 7 to 9 is beneficial as Ore is your highest per-unit value resource. Overall, it seems to align with moving towards higher-value resources, albeit further concentrating your Brick.\n\n**Negotiation Tactician:** Player 0 previously offered (3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep), which I rejected. That offer implied they wanted Brick and Sheep, and were willing to give up Sheep and Ore. Their current offer still requests Brick, but now offers Wood and Sheep for it, dropping the previous request for Sheep. They are consistent in wanting Brick. They offered a significant amount of Ore in the previous trade, and are now asking for it. The fact they've adjusted their offer significantly might indicate a strong desire for Brick. Given the positive value for us, accepting this trade seems like a good move without immediate counter.\n\n***\n\n**Value Maximizer:** The calculation indicates a robust positive gain of 95 in total value. From a pure value perspective, this is an excellent trade.\n\n**Strategic Resource Analyst:** While the increased concentration in Brick is noted, the substantial acquisition of high-value Ore, coupled with shedding lower-value Wood and Sheep, generally strengthens your resource portfolio's overall quality. The move towards more high-value resources is strategically sound.\n\n**Negotiation Tactician:** Given the clear value increase for us and Player 0's consistent desire for Brick, accepting this improved offer seems tactically sound. It builds a positive trading relationship by accepting a favorable offer, rather than immediately pushing for more, especially when the current offer is already very good.\n\n***\n\n[Accept]",

Now, assessing the new total values:\n- Updated Resources:\n  - Wood: 18 (21 - 3)\n  - Sheep: 6 (9 - 3)\n  - Brick: 22 (17 + 5)\n  - Ore: 12 (10 + 2)\n- Updated Values:\n  - Wheat: 100\n  - Wood: 162 (18 * 9)\n  - Sheep: 96 (6 * 16)\n  - Brick: 572 (22 * 26)\n  - Ore: 420 (12 * 35)\n  \n**Updated Total Value:**  \n**1,350** (+125 from previous total).  \nThe expert recommends looking for trades that can increase either Brick or Ore values, as they hold the highest value.\n\n### Expert 2: The Risk Assessor\n**Analysis:** \nThis expert evaluates the risk versus reward of trades to ensure maximizing gains without overcommitment.\n- The previous deals were beneficial but the expert encourages caution, especially since Player 1 is less likely to trade after rejecting two offers.\n\n**Next Step:**\nThe expert suggests waiting for the next turn to see if Player 1 re-engages and offers something beneficial. However, if Player 0 receives no offers, propose smaller, safer trades that can still increase overall resource tracking based on the types of resources Player 1 might need.\n\n### Expert 3: The Market Analyst\n**Analysis:**\nThis expert studies market demand and supply aspects of resources. Since many players might favor bricks given their utility in construction, the value of resources will fluctuate.\n\n**Next Step:**\nGiven Player 1's acceptance of the previous trade, the Market Analyst recommends making a conservative offer based on what is in excess. With bricks gained, consider:\n- Offering 4 Sheep for 5 Wood or 3 Ore, as it leverages excess Sheep without depleting too much from the inventory.\n\n### Summary of Next Steps:\n- **Expert 1**: Look for trades to further increase Brick or Ore resources.\n- **Expert 2**: Wait for Player 1 to make an offer before making more aggressive trades.\n- **Expert 3**: Consider smaller trades that maintain resource levels while capitalizing on market demands.\n\nTaking these advices into account, Player 0 could wait for Player 1's response or create a new offer utilizing strategies from the experts, for example:\n- `[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 5 Wood]` if Player 1 appears interested in Wood resources or similar reflective offers.\n\nThis careful strategy could ensure maximizing resource values while keeping players engaged.",

Wheat is moderate.\n3.  **Evaluate the incoming offer from a strategic perspective:** Player 0 is offering 4 Sheep for 5 Wood.\n4.  **Check immediate feasibility (must be done first):** I only have 3 Wood. I cannot give 5 Wood.\n5.  **Strategic implication if it *were* possible:** If I had enough Wood, taking more Sheep (which I have a decent amount of and are good value) for Wood (which I have little of and is lower value than Sheep) would generally be a good value exchange. However, since I have so little Wood, giving it up would make me even more scarce in a potentially useful resource.\n6.  **Final decision based on feasibility:** The offer is not executable. It *must* be denied. In the future, I should aim to acquire more Wood, especially if it's cheap, to balance my resource portfolio.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "In the Negotiation Game, let's introduce three different types of trading experts to analyze the situation and guide Player 0 through the next steps:\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Maximizer\n**Thought Process:**\nThis expert focuses on maximizing the total value from trades. Evaluating the current situation, the expert notices that Player 0 has a good amount of high-value resources (like Ore and Brick) and needs to negotiate trades that yield higher value back. The expert calculates the offer and sees that while Brick has a high value, it's essential to ensure that trades do not deplete the quantity of high-value Ore.\n\n### Expert 2: The Market Analyst\n**Thought Process:**\nThis expert analyzes the current market trends and demand for the available resources. They recognize that Brick and Ore typically have a much higher market demand compared to Sheep or Wood. This expert suggests focusing on trades that involve Brick as a primary resource due to its high value and possible need by other players. They propose to continue offering smaller quantities of lower-value resources such as Sheep or Wood for higher quantities of Brick or Ore.\n\n### Expert 3: The Risk Manager\n**Thought Process:**\nThis expert is concerned with maintaining a balanced inventory. They assess what Player 0's current stock will look like after potential trades. Since Player 0 initially has 9 Sheep and 10 Ore but needs to ensure longevity in available resources, they advise against giving away too many Sheep, which might leave Player 0 vulnerable in future trades. The expert suggests retaining a minimum stock of the highest value resources while making small but strategic exchanges.\n\n### Next Steps\nNow, taking insights from all three experts' analyses, Player 0 should consider their next trading actions. The goal is to continually increase resource value while maintaining a well-balanced inventory.\n\n#### Proposed Action:\n- **Offer the following trade to Player 1**: \n  - **[Offer: 2 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]**\n- This trade ensures Player 0 is not surrendering too much of their high-value resources while targeting the valuable Brick that has high demand.\n\nThe next round will be driven by how Player 1 reacts to this new offer.",

However, it's essential to consider the strategic implications and potential future trades of acquiring more Brick, which is a high-value resource.\n\n**Expert 2: The Strategic Trader**\n\n*Step 1: Assess the desirability of the resources being offered and requested in the context of my inventory.*\n\nI have a relatively high quantity of Brick (24), which is my most valuable resource by unit. Player 0 seems to be trying to acquire more Brick from me. I also have a significant amount of Sheep (17) and Wheat (12). Wood (6) and Ore (7) are in lower quantities. The offer of Wheat and Wood for Brick might be a way for Player 0 to acquire my high-value Brick, which is generally not in my interest unless I get significant overpay. I have enough Brick to be comfortable, but losing 5 Brick for low-value resources is not ideal.\n\n**Expert 3: The Market Watcher**\n\n*Step 1: Observe Player 0's past trading patterns and inferred resource needs.*\n\nPlayer 0 has consistently tried to acquire Brick from me (first offer 5 Brick, 2 Sheep, then 5 Brick, 2 Ore, and now 5 Brick). This strongly suggests Player 0 needs Brick. They've also offered Sheep and Wood in previous offers. My acceptance of previous offers suggests I'm open to trading away resources other than Brick, or that I was getting a good deal on those trades. Player 0 seems to be trying to offload lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for high-value Brick. They're trying to leverage my current high quantity of Brick against me.\n\n---\n**Expert 1: The Resource Analyst**\n\n*Step 2: Re-evaluate the offer based on my current resource quantities and potential for future profitable trades.*\n\nI have 24 Brick. Giving up 5 leaves me with 19 Brick. I have 12 Wheat and 6 Wood. Receiving 4 Wheat and 2 Wood increases those quantities to 16 Wheat and 8 Wood. While the direct value trade is unfavorable, if I need to offload lower-value resources, this could be a way to move them for something I might need later, or to simply signal that I'm willing to trade certain resources. However, my goal is to *increase* my total value, and this offer, on its face, decreases it. I need to get more value out than I put in.\n\n**Expert 2: The Strategic Trader**\n\n*Step 2: Determine if there's an immediate strategic advantage to accepting or denying, beyond direct value.*\n\nThere is no immediate strategic advantage to accepting this particular offer. I have a lot of Brick, but that just means I'm a target for Player 0. I don't need Wheat or Wood urgently, and they have low value. Accepting this offer would set a precedent that I'm willing to trade my most valuable resource for significantly lower value resources, which is not a good strategy. I want to build up my total value, not deplete it. This offer is a clear loss for me.\n\n**Expert 3: The Market Watcher**\n\n*Step 2: Predict Player 0's likely next move if I accept or deny this offer.*\n\nIf I accept, Player 0 will likely continue to target my Brick, possibly offering even less valuable resources in the future, as they'll see me as a willing supplier of Brick at a discount. They might also try to drain my Wheat and Wood. If I deny, Player 0 will understand that I'm not willing to give up Brick for such an unfavorable trade. They might then try to offer more valuable resources for Brick, or pivot to trying to acquire other resources from me. Denying signals a strong valuation of my Brick.\n\n---\n**Expert 1: The Resource Analyst**\n\n*Step 3: Make a recommendation based on the value proposition.*\n\nGiven that the direct value exchange is -60 (40 offered value vs. 100 requested value), and my primary goal is to increase total resource value, accepting this offer would be contrary to my objective unless there's a strong strategic reason. There is no such reason here. Recommend **Deny**.\n\n**Expert 2: The Strategic Trader**\n\n*Step 3: Make a recommendation based on long-term strategy and inventory management.*\n\nMy high quantity of Brick is valuable, and I should not be trading it away for low-value resources unless I receive significant overpayment. This offer is a significant underpayment. Accepting would weaken my overall resource portfolio. It's better to hold my Brick or trade it for resources that genuinely increase my total value. Recommend **Deny**.\n\n**Expert 3: The Market Watcher**\n\n*Step 3: Make a recommendation based on influencing Player 0's future behavior.*\n\nBy denying this offer, I can communicate to Player 0 that my Brick is highly valued and not available for cheap trades. This might encourage Player 0 to offer more favorable terms for Brick in the future, or to shift their focus to other resources I might be willing to trade for better value. Accepting would set a bad precedent. Recommend **Deny**.\n[Deny]",

Resource Valuator's Perspective**\nThe Resource Valuator focuses on the values and quantities of provided and requested resources.\n\n- **Current Inventory Value:**\n    - Wheat: 20 (5 each) = 100\n    - Wood: 21 (9 each) = 189\n    - Sheep: 9 (16 each) = 144\n    - Brick: 17 (26 each) = 442\n    - Ore: 10 (35 each) = 350  \n\n    **Total Value = 100 + 189 + 144 + 442 + 350 = 1225**\n\n- **Key Offer Analysis:**\n    - **Initial Offers:**\n        - 3 Sheep (48) + 2 Ore (70) = 118 offered for 5 Brick (130) + 2 Sheep (32). Total = 162.\n    - **Accepted Offer:**\n        - 3 Wood (27) + 3 Sheep (48) for 5 Brick (130) + 2 Ore (70).\n        - Current total value from this trade is positive as you gain 130 + 70 against 27 + 48.\n    \n- **Next Steps:**\n  - Keep an eye on trades balancing between high-value Ore/Brick and mid-value Sheep/Wood.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Market Analyzer's Perspective**\nThe Market Analyzer evaluates the current trading landscape and market conditions.\n\n- **Market Trends:**\n    - Brick is a high-value resource that Player 0 needs. Offering mid-tier resources (Sheep/Wood) for Brick is viable.\n    - Observing that Players 1 and others predominantly deal with mid and high-value items, Player 0 should aim to trade lower-value resources for more.\n  \n- **Current Offerings & Future Strategy:**\n    - Current offers are met with a mix of acceptance and rejection.\n    - Steer away from too many offers of Sheep, which seem saturated or undervalued. Focus on leveraging Wood or lower-value Wheat to secure more Brick or Ore.\n  \n---\n\n#### **3. Negotiation Strategist's Perspective**\nThe Negotiation Strategist looks at tactics and negotiation skills.\n\n- **Negotiation Dynamics:**\n    - Players are often rejecting trades that seem to undervalue their assets. \n    - Employ tactics of bundling lower-value resources with small quantities of high-value resources to create perceived value.\n    \n- **Future Offers:**\n    - Propose trades with larger quantities of lower-value resources to offset high-value requests.\n    - Aim to combine resources more attractively, such as 2 Wheat + 5 Wood for 3 Brick, to get a better response.\n    \n---\n\n### Next Trade Action\nAfter assessing the perspectives of the three experts, I will propose the next trade offer:\n\n**Trade Offer:**\n- **[Offer: 3 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 4 Brick]** \n\nThis offer aims to combine lower-value resources to fetch higher-value Brick, assessing the market's need for substantial quantities in trades.",
