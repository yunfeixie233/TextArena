I will focus on trading away resources we have in abundance, especially those with lower individual value, for resources with higher individual value, or those we have less of. I see we have a good quantity of Brick, which has a moderate value, and a very strong quantity of Ore, which has the highest value. Wheat has the lowest value but we also have a substantial amount.\n\n### Expert 2: The Scarcity Exploiter\n\n**Step 1:** I'll analyze our current inventory from a scarcity perspective. While value is important, perceived scarcity (either by us or by other players) can create leverage. We have a fair amount of all resources, but our Wheat and Wood are not as abundant as Brick or Ore. If we can identify a resource that other players might be short on, but we have in abundance, that allows us to dictate terms. Our high quantities of Brick and Ore could be strategic bargaining chips.\n\n### Expert 3: The Market Trend Forecaster\n\n**Step 1:** I need to consider what resources other players might covet. Assuming typical game progression, players often need Wood and Brick early for expansion, and Ore later for development. Our high quantity of Brick might attract offers for rarer (to others) resources. Our large Ore holding is a powerful endgame asset, but also a potential target for those desperate for high-value trades. I will prioritize understanding the potential \"demand\" from other players based on this common progression.",

      "response": "Here's how my three hypothetical experts would analyze the situation, step by step:\n\n**Expert 1: The Quantity Maximizer**\n*   **Step 1:** My primary goal is to increase the *number* of resources I possess. This gives me more options for future trades and a larger base to draw from. I'll always prioritize acquiring more items, even if their individual value isn't the highest, especially when I have an abundance of a particular resource.\n\n**Expert 2: The Value Optimizer**\n*   **Step 1:** My main objective is to maximize the *total value* of my resources. I will focus on trading away low-value items for high-value items, aiming for a net gain in monetary worth. I need to calculate the current value of the incoming offer against my resources.\n\n**Expert 3: The Strategic Balancer**\n*   **Step 1:** I need to consider both quantity and value, but also the overall \"balance\" of my inventory. Having a diverse set of resources is strategically advantageous, as it reduces vulnerability to price fluctuations or specific trade partner demands. I will evaluate the offer in terms of how it affects my resource distribution and future trading flexibility.\n\n---\n\nHere's how they'd respond to the offer:\n\n**Expert 1: The Quantity Maximizer**\n*   **Step 2:** The incoming offer asks for 3 Sheep and 2 Wheat, in exchange for 1 Ore and 1 Brick. I currently have 15 Sheep and 13 Wheat, so I have plenty to spare. I would gain 2 items. This seems like a good deal for increasing my raw count.\n\n**Expert 2: The Value Optimizer**\n*   **Step 2:** Let's crunch the numbers for the incoming offer:\n    *   Resources offered *by Player 1*: 1 Ore (Value: 38) + 1 Brick (Value: 23) = Total Value: 61\n    *   Resources requested *from Player 0*: 3 Sheep (Value: 17 each) + 2 Wheat (Value: 5 each) = 3 * 17 + 2 * 5 = 51 + 10 = Total Value: 61\n    *   The values are equal. This trade offers no direct value gain.\n\n**Expert 3: The Strategic Balancer**\n*   **Step 2:** This offer involves trading away Sheep (medium value, high quantity) and Wheat (low value, high quantity) for Ore (high value, medium quantity) and Brick (medium value, high quantity). I have plenty of Sheep and Wheat, so losing a few won't hurt my ability to trade them later. Getting more Ore, which is high value, is good for my overall value and diversity. Getting more Brick adds to a resource I already have substantial amounts of, but it's not a bad resource. The quantities seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\nHere's the final decision based on their combined insights:\n\n**Expert 1: The Quantity Maximizer**\n*   **Step 3:** While the net item gain is small (+2 items), I'm giving up a total of 5 items for 2, actually a net loss of 3 items. My mistake in calculation. I initially thought I was gaining items, but I'm losing 3 items from my inventory. This goes against my primary objective of maximizing quantity. I leave the game.\n\n**Expert 2: The Value Optimizer**\n*   **Step 3:** Since the offer presents exactly equal value (61 for 61), there is no direct value gain. My strategy is to increase total value, and this trade does not achieve that goal. Therefore, I advise against accepting this specific offer.\n\n**Expert 3: The Strategic Balancer**\n*   **Step 3:** Given that the value is neutral (as highlighted by Expert 2) and Expert 1's realization that we are *losing* quantity, this offer, while not terrible, doesn't significantly improve our strategic position or resource balance. We have plenty of Sheep and Wheat, so moving some wouldn't hurt, but gaining more Brick (which we also have in abundance) isn't ideal. While Ore is valuable, the overall deal is not compelling enough to accept without a clear gain.\n\n---\n**Player 0 Action:**\n[Deny]",

The values are precisely equal (61 for 61). This trade provides no immediate gain in total value for us. While a value-neutral trade can sometimes be part of a larger strategy, my primary directive is to increase total value.\"\n\n**Expert 2 (Resource Manager) - Step 1:**\n\"We have good quantities of all resources. Giving up 1 Ore and 1 Brick, even for 3 Sheep and 2 Wheat, reduces our stock of two of our most valuable individual resources (Ore at 38, Brick at 23). We have plenty of Sheep and Wheat, but trading away high-value items for equally-valued lower-value items, even if it increases our quantity of lower-value items, doesn't align with optimizing our resource composition upwards.\"\n\n**Expert 3 (Market Analyst) - Step 1:**\n\"Player 1 offered a strictly value-equal trade. This suggests they might be looking to diversify, or perhaps they have an immediate need for Ore and Brick. They are not offering any 'deal' to entice us. Given the strict equality, I'd expect them to be willing to make a concession if they truly need these resources. Rejecting this sets a precedent that we are not desperate for trades and will only accept beneficial ones.\"\n\n---\n\n### Turn 2: Rejection of Player 1's Second Offer\n\n**Player 1's Second Offer:** Offered: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep (Value: 4*5 + 1*17 = 20 + 17 = 37) -> Requested: 1 Ore (Value: 38)\n\n**Expert 1 (Value Maximizer) - Step 2:**\n\"Player 1's second offer is even worse from a value perspective. We would be giving up 38 value (1 Ore) to receive only 37 value (4 Wheat, 1 Sheep). This is a net loss of 1 value. Reject categorically.\"\n\n**Expert 2 (Resource Manager) - Step 2:**\n\"We would be trading away our most valuable individual resource (Ore) for a collection of our least valuable ones (Wheat and Sheep), and at a loss. This goes against the principle of improving our resource composition. We have ample Wheat and Sheep. Holding onto Ore is strategically sound.\"\n\n**Expert 3 (Market Analyst) - Step 2:**\n\"Player 1 is still testing the waters, trying to get Ore. They've shifted from a value-neutral offer to a slightly disadvantageous one for us. This re-confirms their probable need for Ore but also indicates they are not yet desperate enough to offer a significant premium. We should still hold our ground. We haven't offered anything ourselves, so we're not perceived as needing a trade either.\"\n\n---\n\n**Player Action for Turn 2:**\n\nPlayer 0 made no new trade offer.\nPlayer 1 rejected the trade offer. // This refers to Player 0's previous lack of offer, not an incoming offer\nPlayer 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n\n**Decision:**\nBased on the unanimous advice, this incoming offer is detrimental.\n\n```\n[Deny]\n```",

We have less Wood and Wheat, which are our lowest value items.\n\n### Expert 3: The Opportunist\n\n**Step 1:** I'll analyze incoming offers to see if they present an immediate opportunity for a profitable trade, even if it's not a perfectly optimized one. The last offer is: *8 Sheep, 4 Wheat -> 2 Ore, 3 Brick*. I need to calculate its direct value impact.\n\n---\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Maximizer\n\n**Step 2:**\n*   **Highest Value:** Ore (38), Brick (23), Sheep (17)\n*   **Lowest Value:** Wheat (5), Wood (11)\nTo maximize value, we should aim to trade away lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or trade low quantities of high-value resources for equivalent or better high-value resources.\n\n### Expert 2: The Resource Manager\n\n**Step 2:** We have 25 Brick and 23 Ore, both high-value and high-quantity. This means we have a surplus of valuable resources, which puts us in a strong negotiating position. We have less Wheat (13) and Wood (12), our lowest value items. We can afford to trade some of our high-quantity, high-value items if the trade is very favorable, but should prioritize trading away low-value items.\n\n### Expert 3: The Opportunist\n\n**Step 2:** Let's calculate the value of the last offer:\n*   **Offered (from Player 1 to us):** 8 Sheep + 4 Wheat\n    *   Value = (8 * 17) + (4 * 5) = 136 + 20 = 156\n*   **Requested (from us to Player 1):** 2 Ore + 3 Brick\n    *   Value = (2 * 38) + (3 * 23) = 76 + 69 = 145\n\nPlayer 1 is offering 156 value to receive 145 value from us. This is a net gain of 11 value for us. This seems like a good offer.\n\n---\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Maximizer\n\n**Step 3:** The Opportunist's calculation shows a net gain of 11 value. Even though we would be giving up high-value resources (Ore, Brick), we are receiving an even higher value in return (Sheep, Wheat). This aligns with value maximization; we get more value than we give.\n\n### Expert 2: The Resource Manager\n\n**Step 3:** We have 15 Sheep and 13 Wheat, while we have 23 Ore and 25 Brick. We are trading away 2 Ore and 3 Brick, leaving us with 21 Ore and 22 Brick. We would gain 8 Sheep (for a total of 23 Sheep) and 4 Wheat (for a total of 17 Wheat). This trade increases our overall quantity of two lower-value items, which isn't ideal for resource management, *but* the Value Maximizer and Opportunist show a net *value gain*. The quantities we're giving up are sustainable for us.\n\n### Expert 3: The Opportunist\n\n**Step 3:** This is the best incoming offer we've seen so far in terms of raw value gain. No need to overthink it; accept the profitable deal.\n\n---\n\n[Accept]",

Post-trade, Wheat drops to 23% of inventory (from 28%), Ore/Brick rise to 43% (from 41%). Repeating the same trade amplifies this rebalancing without depleting key reserves.

      "response": "Here are my three experts:\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nThis expert focuses solely on increasing the total value of your resources. They will try to identify the most undervalued resources you possess and the most overvalued resources you can acquire, aiming for trades that yield the highest possible value gain.\n\n**Expert 2: The Scarcity Strategist**\nThis expert considers not just absolute value, but also the relative scarcity and demand for resources. They will try to acquire resources that are generally harder to come by or are likely to be highly sought after by other players, even if their immediate value gain isn't the absolute highest. They might also aim to offload abundant resources.\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\nThis expert is less about a grand strategy and more about identifying and capitalizing on immediate favorable opportunities. They will react to current offers and market conditions, looking for quick, profitable trades without sticking rigidly to a pre-defined plan. They are good at identifying \"good deals\" when they appear.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nMy first step is to calculate the current total value of all your resources to establish a baseline. Then, I will determine the current average value per unit for each resource to identify potential under/overvalued items in your inventory.\n* Wheat: 13 * 5 = 65\n* Wood: 12 * 11 = 132\n* Sheep: 15 * 17 = 255\n* Brick: 25 * 23 = 575\n* Ore: 23 * 38 = 874\nCurrent Total Value: 65 + 132 + 255 + 575 + 874 = 1901\n\n**Expert 2: The Scarcity Strategist**\nMy first step is to analyze the quantities of each resource you currently hold. This gives us an idea of what we have in abundance and what might be relatively scarce. We have a lot of Brick (25) and Ore (23), a moderate amount of Sheep (15), and less of Wheat (13) and Wood (12).\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\nMy first step is to review the most recent trades and offers to understand the current \"market\" sentiment and what Player 1 seems to be interested in. Player 1 previously offered 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat for 1 Ore, 1 Brick (rejected). Then 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep for 1 Ore (rejected). Most recently, Player 1 offered 8 Sheep, 4 Wheat for 2 Ore, 3 Brick and *you accepted*. This indicates Player 1 values Ore and Brick highly and is willing to pay with Sheep and Wheat.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nNow that we have the baseline value, my next step is to identify resources that are relatively abundant and have lower individual values, making them good candidates to offer. Conversely, resources with higher individual values are good targets to acquire. Currently, Wheat (5) and Wood (11) have the lowest values per unit. Ore (38) and Brick (23) have the highest.\n\n**Expert 2: The Scarcity Strategist**\nGiven our current holdings, and the fact that we just traded away 8 Sheep and 4 Wheat (decreasing our quantities to 7 Sheep and 9 Wheat, assuming the accepted trade went through), our relative scarcity has shifted. We're still rich in Brick and Ore. Our Wood and Wheat are now scarcer. My next step is to consider what resources other players might need \u2013 typically, higher-value resources like Ore and Brick are widely sought after. We also need to assess if we want to lean into our abundance or try to diversify.\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\nThe last accepted trade was 8 Sheep, 4 Wheat for 2 Ore, 3 Brick. This signals that Player 1 is very keen on acquiring Ore and Brick, as they paid a significant amount of lower value resources to get them. Our strategy should capitalize on this, either by offering more Ore/Brick for things we want, or by demanding high value for our Ore/Brick. My next step is to prepare an offer that leverages Player 1's apparent demand for Ore and Brick.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nConsidering the last trade where we exchanged 8 Sheep (value 136) and 4 Wheat (value 20) for 2 Ore (value 76) and 3 Brick (value 69), we paid 156 value to receive 145 value. This trade resulted in a small *loss* of 11 value. While it may have seemed good for other reasons, from a pure value maximization standpoint, this was not ideal. My next step is to craft an offer that strictly increases your net value. We have abundant Brick (25-3=22) and Ore (23-2=21). We're now relatively lower on Wheat (13-4=9) and Sheep (15-8=7). We should look to trade our high-value resources for resources that offer a significant gain in value, or trade low-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n**Expert 2: The Scarcity Strategist**\nAfter the last trade, our updated quantities are now:\nWheat: 9\nWood: 12\nSheep: 7\nBrick: 22\nOre: 21\nWe have an abundance of Brick and Ore, which are also high-value and likely in demand. Sheep and Wheat are now scarcer for us. My next step is to propose a trade that capitalizes on our surplus high-demand resources (Ore, Brick) to acquire resources we are now low on, or to acquire even more high-value resources at a favourable rate, further cementing our strong position. Given Player 1's clear demand for Ore and Brick, we can command a good price.\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\nPlayer 1 has shown a strong desire for Ore and Brick. They keep making offers to acquire them. Since we just accepted a trade where we gave them some, they might be willing to pay even more for them now, thinking we are open to such trades. My next step is to immediately make an offer, before Player 1 does, that builds on their established preference. We should offer a quantity of either Ore or Brick (or both) for a combination of resources we want, ensuring we get more than what they offered last time, value-wise. We can leverage their perceived urgency.\n\n---\n**Player 0:**\n**[Offer: 2 Ore, 3 Brick -> 6 Sheep, 10 Wheat]**",

However, this small gain is marginal against our total value (~1621).

This erodes flexibility for future trades\u2014e.g., we couldn't propose deals requiring substantial Wheat. Ore/Brick values are high but stacking them risks imbalance. Preserving baseline resources is essential for strategic leverage.\n\n**Expert 3 (Opponent Analyst):**  \nPlayer 0's identical offer to our previous successful trade (with inflated sheep/wheat demands) suggests they value these resources highly now. We may exploit this later by counter-offering with better terms (e.g., lower wheat quantities). Denying maintains pressure to negotiate favorable deals while protecting scarcity.\n\n***Final Decision:*** Reject to safeguard resources for higher-value opportunities. Wheat depletion (to 1) is particularly prohibitive. Player 1 can propose a counter-offer next turn focused on incremental, sustainable trades.\n\n```[Deny]```",

This means I want to trade away lower-value items for higher-value items, or consolidate many low-value items for fewer high-value ones, as long as the total value gained exceeds the total value lost. I will calculate the current total value of my resources to establish a baseline.\n\n**Action:**\nCurrent total value: (15 * 5) + (12 * 11) + (10 * 17) + (28 * 23) + (26 * 38) = 75 + 132 + 170 + 644 + 988 = 2009. My aim is to make offers that result in a higher total value than this.\n\n---\n### Expert 2: The Resource Manager\n**Thought Process:**\nI will analyze past trades to understand Player 1's preferences and my own resource flow. I accepted Player 1's last offer, which involved giving away Sheep and Wheat for Ore and Brick. This increased my Ore and Brick quantities, which are higher value resources. My last offer to Player 1, however, was rejected. I need to consider what Player 1 might actually want and what I have in surplus relative to future needs or current value. My inventory of Wheat, Wood, and Brick is quite high.\n\n**Action:**\nPlayer 1 recently traded 8 Sheep and 4 Wheat for 2 Ore and 3 Brick from me. My rejected offer was 2 Ore, 3 Brick for 6 Sheep, 10 Wheat. This indicates Player 1 wants Ore and/or Brick, and perhaps doesn't value Sheep and Wheat as highly, or simply wasn't getting enough value for their Ore/Brick. I have plentiful Brick and Wheat.\n\n---\n### Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader\n**Thought Process:**\nGiven the rejection of our last offer, we need to make a more appealing proposition to Player 1. They clearly want Ore and Brick. We have a good supply of both, but we also want to gain value. Instead of just offering our high-value items, we should try to trade our plentiful lower-value items (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) for what they want, or to improve the value ratio if we are trading high-value items. Since Player 1 rejected an offer where we asked for Sheep and Wheat, it suggests they value these less or don't need them as much. Let's try to offer them something they want (Ore/Brick) but get a better return in terms of total value, perhaps by bundling a lower-value resource.\n\n**Action:**\nPlayer 1 has shown a willingness to give Sheep and Wheat for Ore and Brick. My last offer was probably too greedy on the Sheep and Wheat side for them. I will formulate a new offer that acknowledges Player 1's apparent desire for high-value resources while still ensuring a net value gain for Player 0. I have a lot of Brick. Let's consider offering Brick, possibly combined with a smaller amount of Ore, for their lower-value resources that I can still profit from.\n\n---\n**Thought Process for all experts:**\nThe previous offer was rejected. We need to find a sweet spot where Player 1 gets what they want (Ore/Brick), and we improve our total value. We have a lot of Brick and Wheat. Perhaps we can make a slight concession on the quantity of Ore/Brick we offer, or ask for a different mix of their lower-value resources.\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Maximizer\n**Thought Process:**\nOur last offer (2 Ore, 3 Brick -> 6 Sheep, 10 Wheat) would have resulted in a value change of (6*17 + 10*5) - (2*38 + 3*23) = (102 + 50) - (76 + 69) = 152 - 145 = +7. This was a positive value change for us, but it was rejected. Player 1 must have seen negative value for themselves, or they simply don't need that much Sheep and Wheat. We need to find a new offer where the value proposition for Player 1 is more attractive, while still maintaining, or gaining, value for us. Let's try to increase our requested value or decrease our offered value *while still being appealing to Player 1*.\n\n**Action:**\nWe have an abundance of Brick. Let's consider leveraging our Brick for some of Player 1's resources. We still want high-value items if possible, or a large quantity of lower-value items to convert later.\n\n---\n### Expert 2: The Resource Manager\n**Thought Process:**\nPlayer 1 has consistently offered Sheep and Wheat for Ore and Brick. My rejected offer was the opposite. This suggests I should reconsider taking Sheep and Wheat in a large quantity unless the value is extremely compelling. I have 15 Wheat and 10 Sheep. I still have significant amounts of Brick (28) and Ore (26). It makes sense to continue using my high quantities of certain resources to acquire items I need or to convert them into higher value.\n\n**Action:**\nGiven that Player 1 values Ore and Brick, and I have a surplus of Brick, I should try to trade away Brick for something I may need or that is valuable to me. I need to be careful not to deplete my high-value resources too much without a significant gain.\n\n---\n### Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader\n**Thought Process:**\nPlayer 1's acceptance of the earlier offer (8 Sheep, 4 Wheat -> 2 Ore, 3 Brick) indicates they are willing to trade away Sheep and Wheat for Ore and Brick. Our rejected offer was trying to reverse this. We should try to leverage our surplus Brick to get something valuable in return, or something we can easily convert later. Perhaps giving up some Brick for Wood or even more Wheat would be good if the value is right since our Wheat is low value and we have a lot of Brick. It seems Player 1 wants Ore and Brick, so let's offer some of those. Can we get something else valuable that we don't have a lot of, like Wood? Or perhaps consolidate our low-value assets?\n\n**Action:**\nI will propose an offer where we offer a modest amount of our high-value resources (Ore/Brick) and ask for a significant quantity of their low-value resources, but ensure that the total value received is higher than the total value offered. Since Player 1 rejected our last offer wanting Sheep and Wheat, perhaps the quantities were too high. We have plenty of Brick, so let's try to get rid of some for something of reasonable value.\n\n---\n**Thought Process for all experts:**\nWe need to make an offer. Player 1 values our Ore and Brick. We have a lot of Brick. Let's try offering a moderate amount of Brick for a reasonable quantity of a resource Player 1 has in surplus, ensuring we gain value.\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Maximizer\n**Thought Process:**\nMy goal is positive value. Let's craft an offer involving some of our high-quantity but still valuable Brick. Perhaps we can target a lower-value resource from Player 1, but in a quantity that makes the trade worthwhile. For example, trading Brick for Wood, or even more Wheat if the ratio is very favourable.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's try to offer 5 Brick (value 5*23 = 115) and ask for something. What do we lack? Wood isn't high, and Wheat is our lowest value. What if we offer a specific amount of high-value items and ask for specific low-value items in a favorable ratio?\n\n---\n### Expert 2: The Resource Manager\n**Thought Process:**\nI have 28 Brick currently. This is a very high quantity. I can afford to trade some. Player 1 seems to want Brick and Ore. My Wheat is 15. Sheep is 10. Wood is 12. My Ore quantity is good (26) but I should protect it for now unless I get a huge return. I can trade my plentiful Brick for something that could increase my total value or set me up for future trades.\n\n**Action:**\nI will propose an offer using Brick as the primary offered resource, aiming to obtain something that improves my overall value while still being palatable to Player 1.\n\n---\n### Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader\n**Thought Process:**\nGiven Player 1's desire for Ore and Brick, and our surplus of Brick, we should make an offer that is clearly beneficial to us, but also attractive enough for Player 1. If we offer only Brick, it's simpler. What would be a good return? Since our lowest value is Wheat (5), we could target acquiring a lot of Wheat if our offer is appealing enough.\n\n**Action:**\nI will propose an offer: [Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Wood, 5 Wheat].\nValue offered: 5 * 23 = 115\nValue requested: (2 * 11) + (5 * 5) = 22 + 25 = 47.\nThis results in a *loss* of value. This is not good. I made a mistake here by trying to get too many low-value items. I need to ensure an *increase* in value for my side.\n\n*Self-correction*: My previous action was incorrect. I need to make offers that *increase* my total value. Offering a high-value item for a low-value item, even in quantity, might not be a value gain. I need to ask for higher value than I give. Let's rethink. If Player 1 wants Ore/Brick, and I have Brick, I should give them Brick, and ask for a higher value back.\n\nLet's try: [Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore].\nValue offered: 3 * 23 = 69\nValue requested: 1 * 38 = 38. This is also a value loss. This is wrong.\n\nOkay, let's reverse. What if I leverage my *low* value items to get high value items?\nPlayer 1 offered Sheep and Wheat for Ore and Brick before. They clearly want Ore and Brick. We have a lot of Wheat and Wood.\n\nRevised Action: I will try to offer some of our lowest-value, high-quantity resources to get something more valuable, or at least consolidate.\nThink about player 1's known preference. They offered 8 Sheep, 4 Wheat for 2 Ore, 3 Brick. This is an exchange we accepted.\n\nMy rejected offer was 2 Ore, 3 Brick -> 6 Sheep, 10 Wheat. Player 1 said no. So they don't want to give up Ore/Brick for that amount of Sheep/Wheat.\n\nLet's try to reverse the previous successful trade, but make it more appealing to Player 1, and still profitable for us.\n\nPlayer 1 gave (8 * 17) + (4 * 5) = 136 + 20 = 156 value.\nWe gave (2 * 38) + (3 * 23) = 76 + 69 = 145 value.\nWe gained 11 value.\n\nWe want to *gain* value. We have plenty of Brick and Wheat. Let's offer some low-value items for a smaller quantity of their higher-value items.\nIf Player 1 wants Ore/Brick, and gives Sheep/Wheat, maybe we can give *more* Sheep/Wheat for *less* Ore/Brick?\n\nThis is getting complex. Let's simplify. I want more value. I have plenty of Brick (28) and Wheat (15).\nPlayer 1 demonstrated they value Ore and Brick from me.\nMy current total value is 2009.\n\nLet's focus on offloading some of my Brick for *something* that increases my total value.\n\n**Finalized Action:**\nI will offer a reasonable amount of my overstocked resource (Brick) for a resource from player 1 that helps me consolidate or gain value, or that they have in surplus.\nI will try to make an offer that gives Player 1 some of what they want, but is overall better for Player 0 in terms of value.\n\nLet's offer: 3 Brick (Value: 69) and ask for 1 Ore (Value: 38). This is a net value *loss* of 31 for us. This is not good.\n\nOkay, I'm stuck on making an action that is profitable and attractive. I need a clear value gain from the perspective of Expert 1.\nLet's reverse the thought. What if I *ask* for something I need (Ore or Wood) and *offer* something I have a LOT of (Brick or Wheat)?\n\nPlayer 1 rejected my previous offer of 2 Ore, 3 Brick -> 6 Sheep, 10 Wheat. They apparently didn't value the Sheep and Wheat for their high-value Ore/Brick.\nSo, I need to offer them less of my high-value for their low-value, or offer them low-value for their high-value.\n\nLet's pivot and try to trade Wheat/Sheep/Wood for Ore/Brick. I have plentiful Wheat.\nI have 15 Wheat value 5 (75 total). 12 Wood value 11 (132 total). 10 Sheep value 17 (170 total).\nI want more Ore (value 38) or Brick (value 23).\n\nA common ratio for my low value to high value is roughly 5-6 Wheat for 1 Brick or 8-9 Wheat for 1 Ore.\nOr perhaps 2 Wood for 1 Brick.\n\nLet's try: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick].\nValue offered: 6 * 5 = 30\nValue requested: 1 * 23 = 23\nThis is a small value loss. Still not what I want.\n\nMy previous accepted trade was Player 1: 8 Sheep, 4 Wheat -> Player 0: 2 Ore, 3 Brick.\nValue gained for Player 0 was +11.\n\nI need to make an offer that results in a net positive value for me.\n\nMy resources are: Wheat: 15 (5), Wood: 12 (11), Sheep: 10 (17), Brick: 28 (23), Ore: 26 (38).\n\nLet's consider an offer that's attractive to Player 1 (offering them Brick/Ore) but where I receive higher overall value.\nPerhaps by accepting a lower individual value, but a higher quantity, for subsequent conversion.\n\nI have 28 Brick. I can spare some.\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (value 23) for 3 Wheat (value 15) and 1 Wood (value 11)? Total value 26. This is +3 for me.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wheat, 1 Wood]. This seems small.\n\nLet's retry the initial strategy from Expert 3, but with corrections to ensure value gain.\nPlayer 1 wants Ore and Brick. I have plenty of Brick.\nCan I trade a small amount of Brick for a lot of something else?\nWhat if I give 1 Brick and 1 Wheat (Value 23+5=28) and get 3 Wood (Value 33)? This is a +5 gain.\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Wheat -> 3 Wood]. This is promising.\n\nLet's check with Expert 1's goal: Value Maximizer.\nOffer: 1 Brick (23) + 1 Wheat (5) = 28\nRequest: 3 Wood (3*11) = 33\nNet value change = +5. This is\na positive value change for me (Player 0).\n\nCheck with Expert 2's goal: Resource Management.\nI have 28 Brick, 15 Wheat, 12 Wood.\nTrading 1 Brick and 1 Wheat reduces my quantities slightly, but the gain of 3 Wood increases my Wood quantity to 15. This seems reasonable.\n\nCheck with Expert 3's goal: Opportunistic Trader.\nThis offers Player 1 a Brick, which they like. It also takes Wood, which they might have. We're offering low quantity, low value to them for a slightly higher value.\n\nThis seems like a solid offer.\n\nI made a logical error in the prior turn for Player 0 regarding the rejected offer. That's why the last action was \"no new trade offer\".\nNow, I need to make an offer.\n\nLet's make the proposed profitable offer.\n**[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Wheat -> 3 Wood]**",
