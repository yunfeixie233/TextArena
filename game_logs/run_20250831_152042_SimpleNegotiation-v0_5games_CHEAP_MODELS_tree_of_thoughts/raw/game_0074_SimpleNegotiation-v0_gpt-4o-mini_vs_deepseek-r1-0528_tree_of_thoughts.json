      "response": "### Expert Analysis\n\n**Expert 1: Resource Value Maximizer**\n- **Step 1**: I analyze the current resources and their values. Currently, my most valuable resource is Ore, which has a total value of 273 (7 Ore x 39). Brick has a good value as well with 21 (6 Brick x 21).\n- **Step 2**: I want to maximize my resource value. I propose that trading some of my Ore for Brick can be beneficial since I can leverage the Brick in other trades or for future utilization.\n\n**Expert 2: Supply and Demand Strategist**\n- **Step 1**: Examining the resources and their quantities, I notice that a lot of Wheat and Wood might be abundant in our trading circle or are needed by different players.\n- **Step 2**: I conclude that trading some Sheep might have potential since I have 18 Sheep (plenty). Perhaps I can trade them for some high-demand Brick or Ore.\n\n**Expert 3: Balanced Trade Advocate**\n- **Step 1**: I see the need to maintain a balanced resource pool. Although Ore and Brick are valuable, I shouldn't focus solely on them as it may lead to scarcity in flexibility.\n- **Step 2**: I consider trading a mix of resources. Offering 3 Sheep and 2 Ore for 5 Brick and 2 additional Sheep could improve my position while maintaining a good range of resources.\n\n### Collective Decision\n- **Expert 1** suggests trading Ore for Brick to capitalize on value maximization.\n- **Expert 2** pushes for trading Sheep, targeting Brick or Ore, emphasizing supply and demand dynamics.\n- **Expert 3** proposes a balanced trade, using both Sheep and Ore to receive Brick and Sheep.\n\n**Consensus Step**: There's a potential trade-off involving multiple resources, focusing on a combination of Ore and Sheep for Brick could work.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n- **Action**: [Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]\n\n### Turn Processing\n- Assuming this offer is presented, we'll see how it's received in the next turn. If accepted, it increases my total resources, thus improving overall value. If denied, we'll reevaluate the next best offer based on direct feedback from other players. \n\n### Turn 1 Recap\n- Current Offering: [Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]\n- Awaiting response from other players for acceptance or denial. \n\n### Turn Summary\n- The game is shaping up to maximize the values, with focus on flexibility, demand/supply, and overall resource strategy.",

Immediate value loss of 8. **Deny this offer.**\"\n\n2. **Resource Strategist's Analysis (Step 2 - Long-term Resource Strategy):**  \n   \"After trade:  \n   - Brick reduced from 10 to 5 (high-value resource at 20/unit).  \n   - Sheep increases by 1 (7 to 8), Ore increases by 2 (24 to 26).  \n   We already have excess Ore (24) and Sheep isn\u2019t a priority. Losing 50% of our Brick stock is too costly, depleting a scarce high-value resource. Accumulating more Ore/Sheep offers no strategic upside. **Deny.**\"\n\n3. **Trade Negotiator's Analysis (Step 3 - Counteroffer Potential):**  \n   \"No viable counteroffer here; Player 0 didn\u2019t request low-value resources (Wood/Wheat). Initiating a counter is possible but risky without knowing Player 0's valuation. Best to deny and propose a new trade later when we control terms.

Example: 3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore (gain 14 value). **Deny now, initiate optimized trade next turn.**\"\n\n**Final Decision:** The experts unanimously advise denying Player 0's offer due to immediate value loss and no strategic benefit.  \n\n`[Deny]`",

Our Wood is abundant but low value (23 units at 8 each), and Ore is scarce but high value (38 each). Player 0's offer requires us to give Brick (our second-highest value) and Wood. This fails to leverage our surplus effectively and weakens our position.\n\n**Expert 3 (Negotiation Specialist)**  \nStep 1: Player 0 consistently requests Brick and Wood, indicating high demand. We should counter by offering our excess Wood for their Ore\u2014our priorities to increase value. A trade like 3 Wood (24 value) for 1 Ore (38 value) would net us +14 value. They may accept given their demand for Wood.\n\n**Final Decision**:  \nPlayer 0's offer is rejected ([Deny]) because it reduces our total value by 34.

They undersold their resources.\n  - The current offer from Player 1 of \"3 Wood for 1 Ore\" is also not beneficial since Ore has a higher value than Wood.\n  \n- Recommendation: Player 0 should consider trading some Sheep (more surplus and 18 available) for higher value resources like Brick or employment of more Ore for higher value trades.\n\n### Market Dynamics Expert:\n- Market Behavior:\n  - The rejection of Player 0\u2019s offers indicates a potential misalignment between resource value perception or strategy from Player 1.\n  - Player 1 may not value Wood highly, which is supported by their offer of 3 Wood for 1 Ore. This suggests a need for Player 0 to adjust negotiation tactics.\n\n- Recommendations:\n  - Engage Player 1 with a more appealing counter-offer that emphasizes the value of the resources being exchanged.\n  - Perhaps offer a combination of resources that is easier for Player 1 to accept. Something like \"2 Ore + 3 Sheep for 4 Brick\" could be tempting due to the immediate gain of bricks.\n\n### Strategy Expert:\n- Strategic Analysis:\n  - Both players seem to be offering trades with low success; repeated rejections could suggest a stalemate.\n  - Understanding that Player 1 targeted 1 Ore illustrates their likely focus on maintaining higher-value commodities.\n\n- Suggested Action:\n  - Instead of maximizing resource quantity in trade, focus on the quality of each trade. Since Player 1 has only made players to acquire cheaper resources, Player 0 should consider that the willingness may be swaying towards fulfilling their lacking ore resources.\n  - Propose an offer with a higher perceived net gain to Player 1, such as \"2 Ore and 3 Sheep for 1 Wood and 4 Brick.\" This could maximize immediate gains for both players while preserving Player 0's higher-value commodities.\n\n### Conclusion for Next Move:\nBased on insights from all experts, Player 0 should respond to Player 1\u2019s latest offer (\"3 Wood for 1 Ore\") while crafting a new counter-proposal that aims at boosting value. \n\n**Action:** [Offer: 3 Sheep, 4 Brick -> 1 Ore, 3 Wood] \n\nThis offer aims to optimize Player 0's resource management in terms of value while addressing Player 1's needs for Wood and Ore.",

Given that Player 0's current resources are relatively high in quantity, I will focus on trades that maximize their value.\n- *Next Move*: Player 0 gained 1 Ore and 3 Wood but lost 3 Sheep and 4 Brick due to the acceptance of the trade with Player 1. Since the Brick has a high value, it would be wise to focus on acquiring more resource quantities that can have a higher trade value. I suggest finding offers that convert more Sheep or Wood into Ore or Brick.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Utilizer**\n- *Thinking*: My strategy will be around utilizing resources optimally. Player 0 has a surplus of Sheep and Wood, which could be better leveraged for more valuable resources.\n- *Next Move*: I recognize that Player 0 could propose an offer that trades excess Sheep for Brick, which is valued at 21. Additionally, Player 0 should consider trading some Wood as they have 12, which could be converted into Ore. A balanced offer could be something like: \n  - '[Offer: 4 Sheep -> Requested: 3 Brick]'\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: The Risk Assessor**\n- *Thinking*: I need to evaluate the trade risks involved. It seems Player 0's previous offers were not accepted. The current market trends indicate a slow movement of lower-value resources.\n- *Next Move*: To ensure viability in trading, I would suggest Player 0 focus on more appealing offers to Player 1. If needed, we may have to gauge Player 1\u2019s current resource availability and adjust our strategy accordingly. I would recommend opening a dialogue by making a conservative offer that Player 0 is comfortable with, such as:\n  - '[Offer: 2 Sheep, 2 Wood -> Requested: 1 Ore]'\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\nPlayer 0 should consider making a new offer that strategically leverages the insights provided by all experts. Adjusting the resources being offered based on expert feedback can lead to a better bargaining position. \n\n**Suggested New Offer**: \n- '[Offer: 4 Sheep -> Requested: 3 Brick]'\n\nThis offer aligns with the goal of maximizing resource value while also taking into account the available resources of both parties.",

      "response": "### Expert Analysis\n\n**Expert 1: The Resource Maximizer**\n- **Step 1:** Analyzing the resources, the goal is to identify potential trades that can yield a higher overall value. It looks like Brick and Ore have high value compared to Sheep and Wood. \n- **Step 2:** I notice that trading Sheep (which I have in abundance) for higher-value resources like Ore or Brick could be beneficial. However, since Player 1 is not accepting offers for Ore, I will focus on Brick trades instead.\n\n**Expert 2: The Strategic Negotiator**\n- **Step 1:** My strategy is to understand Player 1's trading goals as well as my own. Observing the trades, Player 1 requires both Brick and Wood. This means they may be more flexible with Brick trades.\n- **Step 2:** Since Player 1 accepted my Brick offer earlier, I will propose more trades that capitalize on their need for Brick, while also attempting to gain Ore or Wood which will improve my resources.\n\n**Expert 3: The Risk Assessor**\n- **Step 1:** I evaluate the risk of over-trading valuable resources. It's important to ensure that I retain enough valuable resources while negotiating. \n- **Step 2:** Player 0 currently has a good stack of Ore, but I see the trends: Player 1 is reluctant to give up Ore. Hence, I should be careful not to trade away too much Ore, focusing instead on lower-value resources like Sheep and Wood for Brick trades.\n\n### Expert Actions\n**Expert 1\u2019s Action:**\n- Proposes: \n  - '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 4 Brick -> 1 Ore, 2 Wood]'\n\n**Expert 2\u2019s Action:**\n- Proposes: \n  - '[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 4 Brick, 1 Wood]'\n\n**Expert 3\u2019s Action:**\n- Proposes: \n  - '[Offer: 2 Wheat, 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]'\n\n### Expert Progression\n- **Turn Results:** \n  - Each expert presents their offers.\n  - Awaiting Player 1's responses. Given the analysis, I expect a possibility of acceptance due to the previously established demand for Brick by Player 1.\n\n### Closing the Turn\n- Depending on requests from Player 1, I will adapt the strategy moving forward. It's critical to ensure that the trades enhance my resource value and not deplete essential items. \n\nLet\u2019s proceed with these offers and see what trades materialize!",

The trade significantly boosts total value with no downside.  \n\n2. **Resource Balancer (Focus: Inventory stability)**  \n   - Step 1: Assess resource diversity.  \n     - Ore (23) and Wood (20) are abundant; Sheep (14) and Brick (11) are moderate.  \n     - Post-trade: Wood drops to 18 (still plentiful), Ore to 22 (still high), Sheep rises to 17 (healthy), Brick to 15 (improved). No resource is depleted.  \n   - Step 2: Recommendation: Accept. Trade maintains balance and leverages surplus (Wood/Ore) for higher-value resources.  \n\n3. **Strategic Trader (Focus: Long-term leverage)**  \n   - Step 1: Evaluate Player 0\u2019s behavior.  \n     - Player 0 consistently offers Sheep/Brick for Ore/Wood, suggesting they need these urgently (e.g., for crafting or quests).  \n     - Accepting exploits their desperation; we gain while draining low-priority resources (Wood) and minimally impacting high-value Ore.  \n   - Step 2: Risk: While Ore is valuable, we retain 22 post-trade. Counter-offers risk Player 0 withdrawing. Recommendation: Accept, then test a conservative new offer targeting Sheep.  \n\n**Consensus after deliberation:**  \nAll experts agree to **accept** the offer due to high immediate gains, resource stability, and tactical advantage.  \n\n---\n\n### Decision  \n- **Response to Player 0's offer:**  \n  `[Accept]`  \n\n- **New trade offer to Player 0:**  \n  Proposed: **5 Wood \u2192 1 Sheep**  \n  Rationale:  \n  - Wood surplus (20 \u2192 18 after trade) is low-value (8 each).  \n  - Sheep is high-value (16 each). Net gain: 1 Sheep (16) vs. 5 Wood (40) \u2192 **+24 value**.  \n  - Player 0\u2019s history reveals interest in Wood (e.g., past requests for Wood in trades), increasing acceptance odds.  \n  Offer token:  \n  `[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Sheep]`  \n\n**Updated resources after accepting Player 0's offer:**  \n- Wheat: 11  \n- Wood: 18 (20 - 2)  \n- Sheep: 17 (14 + 3)  \n- Brick: 15 (11 + 4)  \n- Ore: 22 (23 - 1)  \n**Total value:** 1,544 + 74 = 1,618 (+4.7%).",

      "response": "To maximize your total resource value in the Negotiation Game, I will introduce three trading experts that represent different strategies or perspectives on trading:\n\n### Expert 1: The Resource Evaluator\nThis expert focuses on the current resource values and suggests trades that increase total value.\n\n1. **Analysis**: Let's evaluate the current total values of Player 0's resources: \n   - Wheat = 6 * 5 = 30\n   - Wood = 12 * 12 = 144\n   - Sheep = 18 * 14 = 252\n   - Brick = 6 * 21 = 126\n   - Ore = 7 * 39 = 273\n   - **Total Value** = 30 + 144 + 252 + 126 + 273 = 825\n\n   The most valuable resource is Ore and least valuable is Wheat.\n\n2. **Potential Trade Review**: Since Ore is highly valued, the goal should be to maintain or increase its quantity while maximizing value through other trades.\n\n3. **Next Suggestion**: I recommend trading Sheep or Wood for high-value resources. For instance, if Player 1 offers anything that maintains the value or allows for an increase based on future trades, I suggest accepting.\n\n---\n\n### Expert 2: The Demand Expert\nThis expert concentrates on understanding supply and demand dynamics and the potential future needs of the game.\n\n1. **Analysis**: Trading should reflect not just immediate value but also future utility. Player 1 seems to be reluctant to accept trades and might be looking to gain necessary resources they lack.\n\n2. **Current Offer Evaluation**: \n   - Player 0 has numerous Sheep, and although they are valuable, their quantity might allow for trade-offs.\n   - Player 1\u2019s interest in Wood suggests they might require it for their strategy.\n\n3. **Next Suggestion**: As a strategy, I propose offering a combination of Sheep and another low-value resource (like Wheat) for a more balanced resource set with bigger potential returns in the future.\n\n---\n\n### Expert 3: The Opportunist\nThis expert focuses on seizing immediate opportunities, is aggressive in negotiations, and seeks to push more trades.\n\n1. **Analysis**: You have had some successful trades but need to capitalize on Player 1's interest in Wood and their acceptance of previous offers.\n\n2. **Trade Strategy**: Keep the pressure on Player 1; they seem reluctant, but their eventual acceptance indicates they\u2019re needing resources. \n\n3. **Next Suggestion**: I advise offering multiple Sheep in lower quantities to divide the trade and increase chances of acceptance. For example: \n   - Offering 2 Sheep for 1 Brick, and continuously providing value-filled trades, could incrementally elevate your totals.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Next Steps\nNow, synthesizing the suggestions from all three experts, I would propose a new trade offer that balances risk and maximizes both immediate and future potential:\n\n- **Proposed Offer**: [Offer: 5 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 4 Brick, 2 Wood]\n\nThis offer attempts to leverage surplus Sheep while obtaining immediate values in the form of Brick and Wood, which are more high-demand and will bolster your total resource value strategically. It encourages further negotiation without leaving you resource-light. \n\nPlease proceed and make your move based on this analysis!",
