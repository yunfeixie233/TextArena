My total value is calculated as follows:\n  - Wheat (9 Qty x 6 Value) = 54\n  - Wood (25 Qty x 8 Value) = 200\n  - Sheep (10 Qty x 12 Value) = 120\n  - Brick (6 Qty x 22 Value) = 132\n  - Ore (6 Qty x 38 Value) = 228\n  - **Total Value = 54 + 200 + 120 + 132 + 228 = 734**.\n- We should aim to get more high-value resources, especially focusing on maxing out Brick and Ore since they have higher values.\n\n**Trade Efficiency Expert:**\n- I propose looking to trade some of the lower-value resources, like Wheat. We have 9 Wheat but may not need that much of it. \n- Since Brick is quite valuable (22 each), I suggest proposing a trade to increase Brick supply without losing much value.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:**\n- It\u2019s essential to consider the liquidity of our resources. Ore and Brick are stronger investments compared to Wheat and Wood. \n- I recommend that we avoid trading away too many Ore, as they have the highest value, and focus on either Wood, which is more abundant or Wheat.\n\n### Next step proposals for this turn\n\n**Resource Maximizer Expert:** \n- Propose: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 5 Brick, 2 Ore]\n\n**Trade Efficiency Expert:**\n- Propose: [Offer: 6 Wood -> 4 Brick, 1 Ore]\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** \n- I don\u2019t see enough value in trading our highest resources right now, so I suggest to hold back and assess offers from others. \n- Propose: [Deny any incoming offers and assess trade needs first.]\n\n### Summary of Current Offers\n\n- [Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 5 Brick, 2 Ore]\n- [Offer: 6 Wood -> 4 Brick, 1 Ore]\n- [Deny any incoming offers] (from Risk Management)\n\nWe will wait to see if we receive any offers from the negotiating partners.\n\n### Turn 2\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate any incoming offers and finalize our trading strategies based on the feedback gathered from our experts.",

It might be that Player 1 values their bricks more and is unwilling to part with them for what they perceive as a lower value.\n\n2. **Next Strategy**: We should focus on creating an offer more appealing to other players.

      "response": "Let's analyze the trading situation step by step with insights from three different types of experts: an Economist, a Strategic Planner, and a Resource Manager.\n\n1. **Economist's Perspective**: \n   - The economist checks the value of current resources. \n   - Current total value of Player 0's resources:\n     - Wheat: 9 qty x 6 value = 54\n     - Wood: 25 qty x 8 value = 200\n     - Sheep: 10 qty x 12 value = 120\n     - Brick: 6 qty x 22 value = 132\n     - Ore: 6 qty x 38 value = 228\n   - Total Value = 54 + 200 + 120 + 132 + 228 = 734.\n   - Looking at Player 1's offer of 5 Brick and 2 Ore for 3 Wheat and 5 Wood (which is what Player 0 has just offered), the economist believes that Player 0 should accept the trade if the net value gained is positive. However, they must first calculate the value trade-offs. With both offers on the table, the economist will analyze whether turning 3 Wheat and 5 Wood into 5 Brick and 2 Ore increases the total value.\n\n2. **Strategic Planner's Perspective**:\n   - The strategic planner suggests looking beyond immediate trades and considering long-term positioning. \n   - Player 0 may be trading away valuable resources (Wood and Wheat), which can play a critical role in future trading scenarios. The concern is that Player 1 seems resistant to trading, indicating either a strong position or a lack of interest. \n   - Their strategy is to wait for Player 1 to make a weaker offer or to engage other players who might be willing to negotiate better terms. Therefore, they might suggest rejecting Player 1's latest offer and holding out until Player 1 makes a more favorable one. \n\n3. **Resource Manager's Perspective**:\n   - The resource manager focuses on the resource quantities and their potential utility. \n   - They note that Wheat (6) and Wood (8) are essential in large quantities for civilization building or future trading. Brick and Ore, though valuable, are fewer in quantity.\n   - They evaluate that Player 1's offer does not significantly add to the total resource diversity for Player 0, which could limit strategic options in future trades. They would recommend against the trade regardless of current resource values unless it secures a vital resource that Player 0 lacks.\n\n### Current Action:\nAfter analyzing from these perspectives, Player 0 has decided on their response:\n\n- Given the analysis:\n  - The economist likes the value seen overall but highlights different paths.\n  - The strategic planner sees a better opportunity ahead by waiting.\n  - The resource manager thinks the trade does not change the diversity of Player 0's resources enough.\n  \nPlayer 0 decides to **[Deny]** the last offer from Player 1: \n- Player 0 maintains their resources and waits for a better opportunity to trade. \n\nNext, Player 0 will consider new offers or attempts to engage other players for better trades.",

      "response": "Let's analyze the trading options using three different experts who will provide their insights based on their perspectives. \n\n### Expert 1: The Analyst\n**Step 1:** Let's assess the value of current resources. \n\n- Wheat: 9 x 6 = 54\n- Wood: 25 x 8 = 200\n- Sheep: 10 x 12 = 120\n- Brick: 6 x 22 = 132\n- Ore: 6 x 38 = 228 \n\n**Total Value:** 54 + 200 + 120 + 132 + 228 = 734\n\n**Proposal from Player 1:** They offered 5 Brick and 2 Ore for 3 Wheat and 5 Wood. I would analyze this as follows: \n- 5 Brick (5 x 22 = 110) and 2 Ore (2 x 38 = 76) have combined value of 186.\n- 3 Wheat (3 x 6 = 18) and 5 Wood (5 x 8 = 40) have combined value of 58.\n\nThis offer would provide a total value increase of 186 - 58 = 128. \n\nHowever, since Player 1 rejected my proposal initially, their offer of 2 Wheat and 4 Wood for 2 Brick and 1 Ore needs to be evaluated similarly:\n- 2 Wheat (2 x 6 = 12) and 4 Wood (4 x 8 = 32) = 44\n- 2 Brick (2 x 22 = 44) and 1 Ore (1 x 38 = 38) = 82.\n\nHere, I need to consider: \n- They would gain 82 - 44 = 38.\n\nIn this situation, I would **[Deny]** the last offer from Player 1, as it does not increase the total value adequately compared to our current inventory.\n\n### Expert 2: The Value Maximizer\n**Step 2:** Focusing strictly on maximizing resource value\u2026\n\nAfter breaking down all offers, I suggest going back to the key resources we have and strategizing a counter-offer. Since Player 1 seems to prioritize Brick and Ore, I can leverage this.\n\nI would propose the following:\n**[Offer: 5 Wood, 4 Sheep -> 4 Brick, 2 Ore]**\n- This represents my higher-value resources (as Sheep offers a total of 120).\n\nIf Player 1 accepts, I assess that I will have: \n- Gained a total of 4 Brick (4 x 22 = 88) and 2 Ore (2 x 38 = 76) = 164.\n- I would be trading away 5 Wood (5 x 8 = 40) and 4 Sheep (4 x 12 = 48) = 88.\n\nResulting in a net gain of 164 - 88 = 76.\n\n### Expert 3: The Diplomat \n**Step 3:** Evaluating the relational dynamics\u2026 \n\nIt's clear that neither side is making progress currently. So instead of a strict value increase, I will focus on establishing a willingness to trade that benefits both.\n\nTo keep negotiations moving forward, I would propose:\n**[Offer: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 4 Brick, 1 Ore]**\n- I would aim to involve more of our resources and assert that I\u2019m willing to part with Wheat and Wood, which might seem less critical than Brick and Ore to Player 1.\n\nThis allows for a broader discussion, opening the floor for further trades. I would not offer a trade directly since Player 1 seems reluctant currently. Instead, I would emphasize the potential for future collaboration after these exchanges.\n\n### Summary:\nAll experts agree that Player 0 should keep seeking trades that either maximize immediate value or open up negotiation avenues. Based on varying perspectives, our final action is critical \u2013 we should **[Deny]** the last incoming offer from Player 1, maintaining our current resource positioning while strategizing future offers that integrate insights from each expert.",
