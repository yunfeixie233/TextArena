      "response": "### Expert 1: Resource Optimizer\n**Thinking:** My goal is to maximize the value of resources by evaluating what I have and what I can potentially gain. Given the values of the resources, it\u2019s clear that Brick has a high value (5 Brick = 30), which we have the opportunity to trade for with Sheep and Ore. \n\n**First Step:** I consider offering some of my lower-value resources (like Sheep) combined with Ore to acquire more Brick, which could give a significant boost in value.\n\n**Offer:** `[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]`\n\n---\n\n### Expert 2: Market Analyzer\n**Thinking:** I have to look at the current market and understand the values of the resources. The current value analysis indicates that Ore is quite valuable, so I need to be cautious about trading too much of it. \n\n**First Step:** I prepare to assess incoming offers based on the value of Brick and other resources to ensure that I am not giving away too much of my highest-value resources while still focusing on potential gain.\n\n**Action:** `[Deny]` (as I'm anticipating the response to the current offer)\n\n---\n\n### Expert 3: Risk Manager\n**Thinking:** My focus is on minimizing risks while trading. The key is to ensure that I don't trade away too much value. I see that the resources I have are strong in quantity and value. \n\n**First Step:** I will advise to accept trades that augment my quantity in high-value resources without sacrificing too much of my capital, ensuring I keep some of my more scarce but valuable resources (like Ore).\n\n**Action:** `[Deny]` (for now, until a more favorable trade is suggested)\n\n---\n\n#### Current Status:\n1. **Offers on the table:** `3 Sheep, 2 Ore for 5 Brick, 2 Sheep`\n2. **Expert Responses:** \n   - Resource Optimizer: Outputting offer.\n   - Market Analyzer: Denies, seeking better valuation.\n   - Risk Manager: Denies due to minimizing risk.\n\n**Next Steps:**  \n1. The Resource Optimizer must rethink based on the current denials.\n2. All experts will reassess if the offer should stand or be revised in the next turn. \n\n--- \n\n### Turn 2\n**Expert 1:** Given the denials, I reconsider the initial offer. Perhaps I should focus on less valuable resources to trade, instead of combining Sheep and Ore. \n\n**Revised Offer:** `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 2 Brick, 1 Wood]`\n\n**Expert 2:** I'll analyze the revised offer taking into account the values. This may not be lucrative enough since Wheat value isn\u2019t as high compared to Brick. My response is to wait for a more enticing offer.\n\n**Action:** `[Deny]`\n\n**Expert 3:** I see the risk in accepting in the current scenario. I will wait for the optimal trade that maximizes value.\n\n**Action:** `[Deny]` \n\n### Current Offer: Denied by all Experts. \n\n---\n\n### Turn 3 - New Analysis\n**Expert 1:** I\u2019ll aim for a simpler trade with direct resources that hold higher trade values. \n\n**New Offer:** `[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]`\n\n**Expert 2:** I see the potential here. This deal gives more solid resources while erasing some of the milling around delving into larger quantities. \n\n**Action:** `[Accept]` \n\n**Expert 3:** I agree, this could bolster our stocks of Brick, reducing the risk of trading lower valued resources in larger quantities.\n\n**Final Consensus:** Accept the offer! \n\n---\n\n#### In Conclusion:\nAccepted trade is `[5 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]`\nLet's reassess the resources after the first successful trade.",

      "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step from the perspectives of three different trading experts who can provide valuable insights:\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Analyst**\nThis expert focuses primarily on the resource values and maximizing the total value after trades.\n\n1. **Initial Values Assessment**: \n   - Wheat: 5 (5 * 5 = 25)\n   - Wood: 21 (21 * 8 = 168)\n   - Sheep: 14 (14 * 12 = 168)\n   - Brick: 6 (6 * 30 = 180)\n   - Ore: 20 (20 * 34 = 680)\n   - **Total Value Before Trade = 25 + 168 + 168 + 180 + 680 = 1219**\n\n2. **Post-Trade Assessment**: \n   After accepting Player 0's offer:\n   - Player 0 now has:\n     - Wheat: 5\n     - Wood: 21\n     - Sheep: 12 (14 - 2)\n     - Brick: 5 (0 + 5)\n     - Ore: 18 (20 - 2)\n   - **New Total Value = 25 + 168 + 144 + 150 + 612 = 1099**\n\n3. **Conclusion from Expert 1**: The trade has decreased the total value from 1219 to 1099. This suggests that the trade was not favorable for maximizing the value.\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Strategist**\nThis expert focuses on resource availability and synergy for future trades and potential uses.\n\n1. **Resource Utilization**: \n   - With the increase in Brick (which is a high trade-able resource), the expert evaluates potential future trades with other players who may need Brick for their building purposes.\n   - Additionally, having fewer Ore and Sheep might limit future trades but increases the stock of a high-value item (Brick).\n\n2. **Future Trade Opportunities**: \n   - By holding 5 Brick now, you can look for trades where other players might require them for construction or development purposes.\n   - The remaining resources can still be leveraged to potentially acquire more resources that are low in quantity, like more Ore or Wheat.\n\n3. **Conclusion from Expert 2**: While the current value has decreased, the Brick increases potential trade opportunities, which should be monitored closely for future interactions.\n\n**Expert 3: The Negotiation Specialist**\nThis expert emphasizes trading strategies and negotiation techniques for maximum outcomes.\n\n1. **Negotiation Dynamics**: \n   - The acceptance of the offer indicates a potential for fostering positive relations with Player 1.\n   - Building goodwill can lead to better trade opportunities in future turns, especially if Player 1 realizes they need your resources later.\n\n2. **Trade Tactics**: \n   - The offer made was a strategic choice to acquire a high-value resource. Consider adjusting future trades based on Player 1\u2019s possible needs or preferences to reinforce negotiation power.\n\n3. **Conclusion from Expert 3**: The relationship formed through this trade may yield better exchanges in later turns, so prioritizing player dynamics can enhance negotiation outcomes in this game.\n\n**Final Decision**: \nGiven the analyses, it appears the trade decreased immediate value but increased future trade potential with Brick. Therefore, the next steps could involve observing future players\u2019 needs and considering offers that will maximize overall resource potential while maintaining favorable player relationships. \n\n**Next Action**: \n- I will offer another trade based on the insights gained from the expert analyses.\n- Example Offer: '[Offer: 5 Wheat, 12 Wood -> 6 Ore, 4 Sheep]'. \n\nPlease provide further instructions or let me know if I should proceed with my next step.",

This indicates that the first trade was not favorable.\n\nNow, let's analyze the current offer from Player 0:\n- Offered: 5 Wheat, 12 Wood -> Requested: 6 Ore, 4 Sheep\n\nLet's calculate the value of the offered and requested resources:\n- Value of offered resources = (5*5) + (12*9) = 25 + 108 = 133\n- Value of requested resources = (6*35) + (4*18) = 210 + 72 = 282\n\nSince 282 (value of requested resources) is greater than 133 (value of offered resources), this trade is not favorable for Player 1.\n\nLet's consider the advice from three different trading experts:\n\n1. **Conservative Expert**: Focuses on minimizing losses and maintaining the current value.\n   - Step 1: Analyze the current offer's impact. \"The current offer from Player 0 is not in our favor as it reduces our total value.\"\n   - The conservative expert would likely advise denying the offer.\n\n2. **Risk-Taking Expert**: Looks for potential gains and is willing to take risks.\n   - Step 1: \"Let's assess if there's a potential for a future beneficial trade by accepting this offer or making a counteroffer.\"\n\n3. **Strategic Expert**: Analyzes the long-term benefits and potential future trades.\n   - Step 1: \"We need to understand Player 0's strategy. Since they made a previous offer that we accepted, let's see if there's a pattern or a specific resource they're interested in.\"\n\nAll experts analyze the situation and share their thoughts. Given the current offer is not favorable, the Conservative Expert immediately suggests denying it.\n\nLet's evaluate the offer:\nCurrent quantities:\n- Wheat: 10\n- Wood: 11\n- Sheep: 13\n- Brick: 10\n- Ore: 7\n\nIf we accept the current offer:\n- We gain: 5 Wheat, 12 Wood\n- We lose: 6 Ore, 4 Sheep\n\nNew quantities if accepted:\n- Wheat: 10 + 5 = 15\n- Wood: 11 + 12 = 23\n- Sheep: 13 - 4 = 9\n- Ore: 7 - 6 = 1\n\nLet's calculate the new total value if we accept:\n- (15*5) + (23*9) + (9*18) + (10*28) + (1*35) = 75 + 207 + 162 + 280 + 35 = 759\n\nAccepting this trade would further decrease our total value from 908 to 759.\n\nGiven the unfavorable nature of the trade, the appropriate action for Player 1 is to deny the offer.\n\nAction: [Deny]",

The 5 Brick have a value of 150, and I gained additional resources worth an estimated 150 in this transaction with Player 1.\n- Next, I proposed a trade to exchange 5 Wheat and 12 Wood for 6 Ore and 4 Sheep. Player 1 denied this, suggesting the offer may not have been favorable.\n\n**Step 2 Suggestion:**\nI need to reassess my resource values. I should focus on enhancing my Ore and Sheep quantities, which have higher value. I\u2019ll consider making a more favorable offer for additional Ore or valuable resources.\n\n### Expert 2: Strategic Trade Negotiator\n**Step 1 Analysis:**\n- I have several resources with varying values, making strategic trades essential to increase total value.\n- I've confirmed that Player 1 accepted my first trade but denied my second offer, suggesting they want to hold onto their Ore.\n\n**Step 2 Suggestion:**\nI need to adapt my strategy. Instead of focusing on Wheat and Wood, I should look to other Players or create an appealing bundle with my less valuable resources to trade for more Ore, which significantly boosts my resource value. \n\n### Expert 3: Market Dynamics Analyst\n**Step 1 Analysis:**\n- Market dynamics involve understanding the current demand for specific resources.\n  \nI successfully expanded my resource base with Player 1\u2019s initial acceptance and may have built some rapport. However, my last offer was rejected, potentially due to the perceived low value of Wheat and Wood compared to the resources I sought (Ore and Sheep).\n\n**Step 2 Suggestion:**\nConsider crafting a more valuable package or re-evaluating my offer to attract Player 1 or even engage other players. I might change my focus to different combinations of resources\u2014something like 3 Wood and 5 Wheat might entice a trade if structured properly.\n\n### Next Steps\nTaking into account the advice from these three experts, my next action should be to offer a combination of my resources that strategically balances my weaknesses (losing Ore) and strengths (maximizing total value). \n\nI will propose a new trade offer to Player 1:  \n\n**Next Offer:**  \n`[Offer: 6 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 5 Ore, 2 Sheep]`",

Therefore, aiming to optimize trades for higher-value resources is essential.\n\n### Market Analyst\n**Step 1**: Analyze the trades made so far.\n- Player 0 made one successful trade for Brick and Sheep by offering Sheep and Ore. \n- Player 1 rejected two offers when looking for Ore and Sheep in exchange for lower-value resources (Wheat and Wood).\n\n**Conclusion**: Player 1 seems to have a strong interest in higher-value resources (Ore). This suggests that trades need to target Player 1\u2019s interest to facilitate a successful transaction.\n\n### Strategic Negotiator\n**Step 1**: Understand the negotiation dynamics.\n- Player 0's offers have mostly been rejected, indicating a need to shift strategy.\n- Consider the resources that Player 1 may want; they did not make another offer, potentially indicating they don\u2019t have much interest in low-value resources.\n\n**Conclusion**: Player 0 should consider a new approach by directly offering high-value resources like Ore or Brick in exchange for multiple lower-value resources from Player 1, to maximize overall value.\n\n### Next Steps\nBased on the evaluations from the experts, Player 0 will make a revised offer that strategically utilizes the interest of Player 1 while maximizing Player 0\u2019s resource value.\n\n#### Revised Offer\n**Action**: \n- [Offer: 5 Ore, 2 Brick -> 12 Wood, 3 Wheat]\n\nThis new offer leverages high-value resources, balancing the trade to include mid-range resources from Player 0, thus aiming for a greater increase in total value. \n\nWhat would you like to do next?",

Player 0's second offer: 5 Wheat, 12 Wood -> 6 Ore, 4 Sheep\n   - Player 1 gives: 6 Ore + 4 Sheep = (6*35) + (4*18) = 210 + 72 = 282\n   - Player 1 receives: 5 Wheat + 12 Wood = (5*5) + (12*9) = 25 + 108 = 133\n   - Net gain: 133 - 282 = -149 (loss), so rejecting is correct.\n\n2. Player 0's third offer: 6 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 5 Ore, 2 Sheep\n   - Player 1 gives: 5 Ore + 2 Sheep = (5*35) + (2*18) = 175 + 36 = 211\n   - Player 1 receives: 6 Wood + 4 Wheat = (6*9) + (4*5) = 54 + 20 = 74\n   - Net gain: 74 - 211 = -137 (loss), so rejecting is correct.\n\n3. Player 0's fourth offer: 5 Ore, 2 Brick -> 12 Wood, 3 Wheat\n   - Player 1 gives: 12 Wood + 3 Wheat = (12*9) + (3*5) = 108 + 15 = 123\n   - Player 1 receives: 5 Ore + 2 Brick = (5*35) + (2*28) = 175 + 56 = 231\n   - Net gain: 231 - 123 = 108 (gain), so accepting could be beneficial.\n\nLet's examine the situation with the help of three different trading experts:\n\n1. **Conservative Trader**: Focuses on minimizing losses and ensuring that any trade is at least somewhat beneficial.\n2. **Risk-Taker**: Looks for trades that offer high potential gains, even if they come with higher risks.\n3. **Resource Optimizer**: Aims to balance the portfolio by adjusting the quantities of resources to maximize overall value, considering the values of the resources.\n\n## Step 1: Initial Analysis by Experts\n- **Conservative Trader**: After the first trade, we have a net gain. We should be cautious with subsequent trades, ensuring they are beneficial.\n- **Risk-Taker**: The first trade was beneficial. We should continue to look for trades that offer significant gains, even if they involve giving up valuable resources.\n- **Resource Optimizer**: We need to assess the current portfolio and see if the subsequent offers improve its overall value and balance.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluating the Fourth Offer\n- All experts analyze the fourth offer: 5 Ore, 2 Brick -> 12 Wood, 3 Wheat.\n- **Conservative Trader**: The offer results in a net gain of 108, which is positive, so it's worth considering.\n- **Risk-Taker**: This is a good opportunity for a significant gain, so we should accept it.\n- **Resource Optimizer**: Let's calculate the new quantities and values. Giving 12 Wood and 3 Wheat, and receiving 5 Ore and 2 Brick. We need to check if this improves the portfolio's balance and value.\n\n## Step 3: Decision on the Fourth Offer\n- Current quantities: Wheat: 10, Wood: 11, Sheep: 13, Brick: 15, Ore: 7\n- After the fourth offer: Wheat: 10 - 3 = 7, Wood: 11 - 12 = -1 (not possible, so we can't accept as is), Sheep: 13, Brick: 15 + 2 = 17, Ore: 7 + 5 = 12\n- Since we cannot give 12 Wood (we only have 11), this trade is not feasible as it stands.\n\n## Step 4: Action for Turn 10\nGiven the last offer is not feasible due to insufficient Wood, and considering we are in the last turn, we should look at making a new offer or sticking with our current resources.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 11 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 5 Ore, 2 Brick]}$",

Let's be prepared to either accept or make a new offer based on our current resources.\"\n\nGiven the current state (Turn 6 and beyond), let's decide on the next action.\n\nCurrent state after the last trade:\n- Wheat: 10\n- Wood: 0\n- Sheep: 12\n- Brick: 22\n- Ore: 12\n\nSince we have no Wood, let's think about what we can offer or request.\n\nLet's consider making a new offer to increase our total value.\n\n### Potential Trade:\nTo increase our value, we need to gain resources that are more valuable. We can try to offer some of our less valuable resources or the ones we have in relatively lower value but sufficient quantity.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering Wheat or Sheep for Wood, as we lack Wood.\n\nLet's examine a potential offer:\n'[Offer: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 10 Wood, 1 Ore]'\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (5*28) + (2*18) = 140 + 36 = 176 and requests resources worth (10*9) + (1*35) = 90 + 35 = 125. This is not a good trade for us as it decreases our total value.\n\nLet's think of another one:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 8 Wood]'\n\nThis involves giving away (4*5) + (1*18) = 20 + 18 = 38 and gaining (8*9) = 72. This trade seems beneficial.\n\nSo, a potential action for Turn 6 could be:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 8 Wood]'\n\nLet's proceed with the format as required.\n\nThe best answer is [Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 8 Wood].",

      "response": "**Expert 1: Resource Optimizer**\n\n1. **Analysis:** My goal is to maximize the value of the resources traded. Currently, I note that the value of Wheat, Wood, Sheep, Brick, and Ore vary in importance depending on trade dynamics.\n2. **Proposal:** Player 0 has accepted a trade with Player 1, which seems useful but could still be further improved. Since Wheat and Wood have lower values, I recommend focusing on obtaining more Ore and Brick, which provide higher overall value. \n3. **Next Step:** Recommend that Player 0 explore trades for getting more Ore to bolster long-term trading potential.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: Risk Assessor**\n\n1. **Analysis:** It\u2019s vital to ensure that no trade diminishes overall resource capability. Accepting trades that might appear beneficial on the surface can lead to resource scarcity in the future.\n2. **Proposal:** The recent trade of 11 Wood and 1 Sheep for 5 Ore and 2 Brick appears to be a balanced approach, considering the relatively high value of Ore and Brick. However, Player 0 should assess the consequences of lower Wood and Sheep quantities.\n3. **Next Step:** Suggest Player 0 evaluate the stability of their resource pool before engaging in another trade, staying wary of potential shortages, especially in common resources like Wood and Wheat.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: Market Analyzer**\n\n1. **Analysis:** The flow of resources between players can have market effects. Typically, Ore and Brick trade at a higher rate, so acquiring those resources can be beneficial. Current offers indicate a need for balanced resource availability.\n2. **Proposal:** The trade offered by Player 1 (5 Brick, 2 Sheep for 10 Wood, 1 Ore) is notable because it leverages Brick's high value. However, this deal skews more towards Wood, making it less appealing given your current resources.\n3. **Next Step:** Advise Player 0 to counter that offer strategically, perhaps suggesting a slightly lower exchange of Wood for Brick or Ore to retain a rich resource pool while increasing value overall.\n\n---\n\n**Current Actions:**\n\n**Player 0:** [Deny] the offer from Player 1 of 5 Brick, 2 Sheep for 10 Wood, 1 Ore. \n\n**Next Offer:** Consider making a counter-offer such as: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore, 2 Brick]. \n\n--- \n\nThis game of negotiation involves analysis from multiple perspectives to ensure that trades increase the total resource value effectively.",
