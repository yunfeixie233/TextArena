      "response": "After a detailed discussion among three trading experts\u2014Value Maximizer, Resource Balancer, and Opportunity Seeker\u2014their analyses converged on a mutually beneficial trade proposal. Here\u2019s their logic:\n\n### Expert Analysis:\n1. **Value Maximizer**:  \n   - Focused on total value gain per trade (current total value: 1371).  \n   - Identified an opportunity to trade low-value resources (Wheat: 5/unit, Wood: 10/unit) for higher-value Sheep (14/unit).  \n   - Proposed: **1 Wheat + 1 Wood (value: 5 + 10 = 15)** for **2 Sheep (value: 28)**.  \n   - **Net gain of +13 value** (28 \u2013 15).  \n\n2. **Resource Balancer**:  \n   - Noted surplus in Wheat (7) and Wood (10), with Sheep (5) as the scarcest resource.  \n   - Recommended against trading high-value surplus (Brick/Ore) unnecessarily, as it risks value loss.  \n   - **Supported the trade**: Uses abundant low-value resources to build Sheep supply (~40% increase in quantity) without impacting flexibility.  \n\n3. **Opportunity Seeker**:  \n   - Advocated for a relationship-building trade likely appealing to opponents (e.g., if they have Sheep surplus).  \n   - Highlighted the offer\u2019s even resource exchange (2 for 2) to appear fair, facilitating future negotiations.  \n   - **Alternatives failed**: Trades involving Ore/Brick risked opponent rejection or value loss.  \n\n### Agreed Decision:\nThe trade **1 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 2 Sheep** maximizes immediate value (+13), optimizes resource balance, and strategically tests opponent willingness without compromising high-value assets. All experts endorse this as the strongest opening offer.  \n\n`[Offer: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep]`",

      "response": "### Expert Analysis\n\n**Expert 1: Resource Valuation Specialist**  \n- **Step 1:** I need to evaluate the value of the offer. This offer exchanges 1 Wheat and 1 Wood for 2 Sheep.  \n- **Value of Offered Resources:**  \n    - Wheat: 1 unit = 1  \n    - Wood: 1 unit = 1.33 (12 value / 9 qty)  \n    - Total Value Given = 1 + 1.33 = 2.33  \n- **Value of Requested Resources:**  \n    - Sheep: 2 units = 3.27 (18 value / 11 qty * 2)  \n    - Total Value Received = 3.27  \n- **Conclusion:** The value I would receive (3.27) is greater than the value I would give (2.33). This could be a beneficial trade.  \n- **Next Move:** I will consider this offer for acceptance but wait for other expert opinions.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: Strategic Trading Insider**  \n- **Step 1:** I will look at the overall trading strategy. The current offer trades 1 Wheat and 1 Wood for 2 Sheep, but I should think about my overall goals.  \n- **Position Analysis:**  \n    - I currently have 6 Wheat, 9 Wood, 11 Sheep, 20 Brick, and 24 Ore. Trading for more Sheep could be advantageous if I think I will need them for future trades or for developing settlements.  \n- **Trade Intent:** While I don't need immediate Wheat and Wood, I could use more Sheep to leverage future trades.  \n- **Conclusion:** The increase in Sheep can give me more options later.  \n- **Next Move:** I will recommend accepting the offer but will assess all options once the round concludes.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: Supply and Demand Expert**  \n- **Step 1:** I'll focus on supply and demand dynamics. The offer is trading less common resources (Wheat and Wood) for more common resources (Sheep).  \n- **Market Status:**  \n    - Sheep are more common in my inventory, and I currently have 11 Sheep. Trading resources that I have in surplus for those which I have in lesser quantity could stabilize my resource variety.  \n- **Conclusion:** Since the Sheep aren't a scarcity, this isn't the strongest offer. However, the total value aspect must be factored in.  \n- **Next Move:** I suggest further evaluation of the offer before making a decision on this initial trade.\n\n---\n\n### Player Decision\nAfter considering all expert insights:  \n- While Expert 1 sees immediate value in the trade, Expert 3 highlights the abundance of Sheep.  \n- Despite not being as critical in my stock, the value in the trade and the strategic benefit of diversifying offers outweigh the caution advised by Expert 3.  \n\n### **Final Action**\n- **[Accept]**  \nThis is an advantageous scenario for me to increase the overall value of my resources. \n\n### Turn Summary\n- I will proceed with this trade, gaining 2 Sheep in exchange for 1 Wheat and 1 Wood. \n- Now, I have the adjusted resources:\n    + Wheat: 5 \n    + Wood: 8 \n    + Sheep: 13 \n    + Brick: 20 \n    + Ore: 24 \n\nRemaining strategies and future offers will be considered in subsequent turns.",

Our current trade increased total value by swapping low-value Wheat (5) and Wood (10) for high-value Sheep (14). We gave 1 Wheat + 1 Wood = 15 value and received 2 Sheep = 28 value\u2014a net gain of 13. Crucially, Sheep offers the highest per-unit value after Ore/Brick, but Ore and Brick are abundant (24/17 units); we shouldn't trade them away. Repeating this trade scales our gains: 1 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 2 Sheep gives another ~13 value boost. Wheat/Wood remain our lowest-value excess resources, so prioritize trading them first.\"\n\n**Expert 2 (Resource Balancer):**  \n\"Our portfolio is skewed: Wheat (6) and Wood (9) are below average in value and quantity compared to Sheep (7), Brick (17), and Ore (24). We need to reduce low-yield overflow\u2014Wheat/Wood risks devaluation if unused. Last trade improved balance by converting 2 low-value units into 2 medium-high Sheep. Repeating it (1 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 2 Sheep) further shifts weight toward higher-value resources without destabilizing: Wood drops from 9\u21928 (still healthy), and Sheep rises from 7\u21929 (optimal for flexibility). Avoid touching Brick/Ore\u2014they\u2019re our value anchors.\"\n\n**Expert 3 (Opportunistic Trader):**  \n\"Player 1 accepted our first offer, signaling they value Wheat/Wood >=2 Sheep. Capitalize on this! Replicating the exact trade (1 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 2 Sheep) has high success odds and immediate payoff. Aggressive multiples (e.g., 2 Wheat + 2 Wood \u2192 4 Sheep) risk rejection without testing their liquidity. If we diversify targets, Player 1\u2019s acceptance hints other players may also overvalue Sheep.

      "response": "### Expert Analysis\n\n**Expert 1: Resource Valuation Expert**\n- Current resources and values need analyzing. I see that Sheep has a high value-to-quantity ratio, making it a valuable resource. Since Player 1 has accepted a trade for Sheep, it seems beneficial, but I need to consider the impact on total value after the trade. The trade with Player 0 produces a net positive value since 2 Sheep are worth 3 while 1 Wheat and 1 Wood only equate to 2.\n- Recommendation: Confirm the trade's value before making a new offer once I have new resources.\n\n**Expert 2: Strategic Trading Expert**\n- Player 1 has limited resources in Wheat and Wood, but has a surplus of Ore and Brick. Focusing on acquiring high-value resources like Sheep, while using surplus resources could be beneficial. The current offer seems favorable as it increases the quantity of Sheep. Accepting it seems like a good strategic move.\n- Plan: After accepting the current trade, assess how much Wood and Wheat is left. Then consider future trades that can leverage the increased Sheep count to acquire more high-value resources.\n\n**Expert 3: Market Dynamics Expert**\n- The trading dynamics suggest that as resources change hands, market values can shift. Accepting the trade from Player 0 suggests a willingness to increase Sheep count, which may give leverage in subsequent trades. Once Player 1 increases their Sheep resource, they should aim to acquire Wood or Ore in return, if possible.\n- Strategy: First, accept the offer to acquire more Sheep, then look for trades that balance out the resource deficits.\n\n### Summary of Actions\n1. Player 1 has accepted Player 0's trade offer resulting in gaining 2 Sheep.\n2. Waiting to see if further offers come in for assessment before deciding on any new trades.\n\n### Next Move\n- Player 1 should now analyze their updated resources and determine the next trade strategy.\n  \n### Current Resources after Trade \n- Wheat: 5 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 9 (Value: 12)\n- Sheep: 13 (Value: 21) - **Increased from 11 to 13**\n- Brick: 20 (Value: 24)\n- Ore: 24 (Value: 34)\n\n### Next Step Action:\n- Assess new potential trades or offers after the increase in Sheep resources. \n\nConsidering that no further offers have been made yet:\n- [Deny] any incoming offer if no additional value can be assessed until next round.",

The resources have the following values per quantity:\n  - Wheat: 1 (6/6)\n  - Wood: 1.33 (12/9)\n  - Sheep: 1.64 (18/11)\n  - Brick: 1.2 (24/20)\n  - Ore: 1.42 (34/24)\n\n  Since I currently have the most valuable resources in terms of trading (Sheep), I should prioritize acquiring more valuable items.\n\n**Expert 2: Resource Optimization Expert**\n- **Step 2:** Looking at Player 0\u2019s recent offers, I need to assess whether the trade is beneficial. The last offer was 2 Wheat and 1 Wood for 1 Brick. The value of this offer is:\n  - Offered: 2 (2 Wheat) + 1.33 (1 Wood) = 3.33 value\n  - Requested: 1.2 (1 Brick)\n\n  This is a net loss based on value since Player 1 would be trading away resources valued at 3.33 for a brick worth only 1.2. Therefore, I will reject this offer.\n\n**Expert 3: Strategic Trading Expert**\n- **Step 3:** I see that Player 0 is trying to trade lesser valued resources (Wheat, Wood) for higher valued resources (Brick). However, they have not offered anything of higher value in return. Since I have sufficient Brick currently, I should focus on maximizing my trades through negotiation. If Player 0 values Brick highly, I can leverage that as I stockpile the more valuable resources.\n\n### Decision Point\nNow it\u2019s Player 1\u2019s turn to decide based on the experts\u2019 insights.\n\n**Player 1 Trading Decision:**\nGiven the insights from all three experts, I will reject the latest offer from Player 0 as it's not beneficial for me. Instead, I will focus on developing a more advantageous trade offer.\n\n**Expert Advice Summary:**\n- It\u2019s wise to hold valuable resources and trade them selectively.\n- Any offer that doesn\u2019t provide a significant increase in resource value should be rejected.\n- Strategic negotiation can lead to future trades with better outcomes.\n\nNext turn, I will explore better trading options or evaluate possible offers from others. \n\n**Action Taken:**\n'[Deny]'",

      "response": "### Expert Analysis for Player 0's Trade Decision  \nI will simulate three expert advisors with distinct perspectives:  \n\n1. **Value Maximizer (Expert 1)**: Focuses purely on net value gain from trades.  \n2. **Resource Balancer (Expert 2)**: Prioritizes resource diversification and reducing surpluses.  \n3. **Trade Psychologist (Expert 3)**: Models Player 1's behavior to predict acceptable offers.  \n\n---  \n#### **Step 1: Initial Analysis**  \n- **Expert 1 (Value)**: Player 0's current total resource value is 1,372 (calculated: 7\u00d75 + 10\u00d710 + 5\u00d714 + 17\u00d722 + 24\u00d733 = 1,372). Low-value resources (Wheat=5, Wood=10) should be traded for higher-value ones (Sheep=14, Brick=22, Ore=33). Best gains: target Sheep or Brick.  \n- **Expert 2 (Balance)**: Wheat (low surplus) and Wood (moderate) are plentiful; Sheep (moderate) and Brick/Ore (large surpluses) need rebalancing. Trade Wheat/Wood for Sheep to avoid glut.  \n- **Expert 3 (Psych)**: Player 1 accepted [1 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 2 Sheep] once but rejected it later\u2014suggests fluctuating interest. No Brick offers accepted; Player 1 may protect Brick. Re-test Sheep to probe behavior.  \n\n\u2192 *Action*: All agree to avoid Ore (untested, high value) and focus on Sheep/Brick.  \n\n#### **Step 2: Trade Strategy**  \n- **Expert 1**: Aim for high-profit Sheep trades. [1 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 2 Sheep] gives +13 net value (5+10=15 given, 28 received). [1 Wood \u2192 1 Sheep] gives +4. Favor repeat of top-gain trade.  \n- **Expert 2**: Resource counts: Wheat=7, Wood=10, Sheep=5. Trading 1 Wheat + 1 Wood for 2 Sheep reduces Wheat/Wood surplus, boosts Sheep flexibility. Avoid Brick\u2014Player 0 already has 17.  \n- **Expert 3**: Player 1\u2019s Sheep rejection risk is high (recent history), but no alternative patterns observed. If retrying same trade, adjust offer: use positive framing or shift to Wood-only. Less aggressive: [1 Wood \u2192 1 Sheep] (lower gain but easier acceptance).  \n\n\u2192 *Action*: Value Maximizer advocates for high-reward trade; Psychologist urges caution.  \n\n#### **Step 3: Final Recommendation**  \n- **Expert 1**: **Propose [1 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 2 Sheep]**. Highest value (+13) and Player 1 accepted this once. Risk rejection, but potential justifies it.  \n- **Expert 2**: **Support [1 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 2 Sheep]**. Balances resources\u2014trades low-value surplus for mid-value scarcity. Brick is redundant.  \n- **Expert 3**: **Advise [1 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 2 Sheep] again**. Psychology: Player 1 may prioritize immediate needs; they accepted before. If rejected, pivot to [1 Wood \u2192 1 Sheep] next turn.  \n\n\u2192 *Consensus*: Retry successful trade for maximum gain.

      "response": "Given the current situation in the negotiation game and the trading offers made so far, I will summarize the resources available to Player 1 and evaluate the current offers received from Player 0.\n\n### Current Resources for Player 1:\n- **Wheat**: 5 (after accepting one trade)\n- **Wood**: 8 (after accepting one trade)\n- **Sheep**: 13 (after accepting one trade)\n- **Brick**: 20\n- **Ore**: 24\n\n### Offers Made:\n1. Player 0 offers: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood \u2192 Requests 2 Sheep (Accepted)\n2. Player 0 offers: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood \u2192 Requests 2 Sheep (Rejected)\n3. Player 0 offers: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood \u2192 Requests 1 Brick (Rejected)\n4. Player 0 offers: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood \u2192 Requests 2 Sheep (Pending acceptance or rejection)\n\n### Expert Analysis:\n**Expert 1 - Resource Maximization Strategist**:\n*Goal*: Maximize the overall value through trades to obtain high-value resources.\n- Considering the initial offers, the Sheep (which are a total of 13 now) are highly valued at 18. Trading 2 Sheep for low-value resources (in this case, Wheat and Wood) does not enhance my total resource value.\n- Thus, I recommend rejecting any trade that offers less overall value compared to the current resources.\n\n**Expert 2 - Risk Aversion Expert**:\n*Goal*: Minimize loss and avoid unfavorable trades.\n- The repeated offer from Player 0 is unlikely to benefit me significantly considering the resources I currently possess. Offering 2 Sheep does not provide me with enough tangible benefits to warrant the loss.\n- I suggest rejecting the currently pending offer for 2 Sheep for the same low-value return (Wheat and Wood).\n\n**Expert 3 - Inventory Management Specialist**:\n*Goal*: Maintain balanced resources while ensuring the value of each type is used effectively.\n- My current inventory has excess resources, particularly Brick and Ore, which can be advantageous. The key here lies in leveraging these high-value resources for better trade offers. \n- I do not see a good enough trade to free up my inventory spots or upgrade my resource quality this round, hence I too would reject the subsequent offers centered around Sheep.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the experts\u2019 analyses, the consensus is to **reject** Player 0's latest offer for 2 Sheep for 1 Wheat and 1 Wood since it does not enhance the overall value of resources held by Player 1.\n\n### Next Step:\nI will [Deny] the latest trade offer from Player 0. \n\n[**Deny**]",

      "response": "After careful analysis from multiple expert perspectives, here's the collective recommendation for your final move (Turn 10) to maximize your total resource value:\n\n1. **Expert 1 (Value Optimizer)**:  \n   \"Your highest-value resources are Brick (22) and Ore (33). Trading low-value resources (Wheat: 5, Wood: 10) for high-value gains is key. Previously successful trades involved Sheep, but recent rejections suggest Player 1 may be low on Sheep or valuing it higher. Target Brick for a safer net gain: offer **1 Wheat + 1 Wood for 1 Brick**. Calculated value: Give 15 (5+10), gain 22 \u2013 **net +7 value**.\"\n\n2. **Expert 2 (Behavior Analyst)**:  \n   \"Player 1 accepted 1W+1Wd\u21922Sh once but rejected it twice afterward, indicating shifting priorities. They also rejected 2W+1Wd\u21921Br, implying Brick is guarded. Offer a *more favorable deal for Player 1* to tempt acceptance: **1 Wheat + 1 Wood for 1 Brick**. This is less demanding than prior Brick offers (only 15 value given vs. 22 received) and may exploit perceived fairness.\"\n\n3. **Expert 3 (Risk Manager)**:  \n   \"On the final turn, prioritize *actionable gains* over high-risk moves. Ore trades (e.g., \u21921 Ore) could yield higher returns but are unlikely to succeed based on history, risking a $0 gain. Sticking to proven resources (Wheat/Wood) with a modest ask (Brick) balances appeal and realism. **1 Wheat + 1 Wood for 1 Brick** offers a reliable +7 value if accepted.\"\n\n**Final Decision**:  \nGiven current resources (Wheat:6, Wood:9, Brick:17), and Player 1\u2019s rejection pattern, propose a value-positive trade likely to succeed:  \n**[Offer: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]**",

      "response": "### Expert Analyses\n\n**Expert 1: Market Value Analyst**\n- I will evaluate the market values of the resources Player 1 currently holds and compare them to the offers made by Player 0.\n- Currently, the total resource values are: \n  - Wheat: 6\n  - Wood: 12\n  - Sheep: 18\n  - Brick: 24\n  - Ore: 34\n  - **Total Value = 94**\n- Player 0's offers exchange 2 minor resources (Wheat and Wood) for either 2 Sheep or 1 Brick. In terms of trade efficiency:\n  - **2 Sheep = Value: 3.27** (assuming 11 Sheep=count towards 18 Value, thus 1.64 value per Sheep)\n  - **1 Brick = Value: 1.2**\n- Neither offer yields any significant advantage considering the market value of current resources. I advise to [Deny] both new offers from Player 0 as they do not increase the overall resource value significantly.\n\n**Expert 2: Resource Strategist**\n- My focus is on maintaining a strong resource distribution. Player 1's current resources allow for building later (Brick, Ore).\n- Sheep are useful in trading scenarios but I see that currently, the value of Sheep doesn\u2019t align with the Brick offer. Staying at a good resource distribution might mean prioritizing keeping Wheat and Wood for future trades that require those resources.\n- Recommended action: Deny all current offers from Player 0 to conserve potentially more advantageous trades or negotiate for more desirable resources.\n\n**Expert 3: Risk Management Expert**\n- Let's analyze the potential risk of accepting Player 0's offers. Accepting trades that do not offer a robust value increase can lead to resource scarcity later in the game.\n- Both offers from Player 0 present minimal strategic gain. Depleting Wheat and Wood, which can be used in larger trades subsequently, is high risk. \n- Conclusion: Current offers do not improve Player 1's overall situation. Therefore, the best strategy is to [Deny] all current incoming offers.\n\n### Mutual Agreement\nGiven the analyses from all three trading experts, it's clear that Player 1 does not benefit from accepting Player 0's offers. The conclusion is as follows:\n\n1. **Reject the trade offer of 2 Sheep for 1 Wheat & 1 Wood**\n2. **Overall Strategy = Maintain current resources for optimal future trades using other items (Wheat & Wood)**\n\n### Action\n- **[Deny]** \n\nWith this decision confirmed by all experts, Player 1 can focus on maximizing resource value through different trading strategies in the upcoming turns.",

      "response": "### Expert 1 (Trade Efficiency Expert):  \nThe initial trade where Player 1 accepted 1 Wheat and 1 Wood for 2 Sheep was highly efficient for Player 0. Why? Because Player 0 gave up resources worth 15 total (5 for Wheat, 10 for Wood) and received 28 in value (14 per Sheep \u00d7 2). That\u2019s a net gain of 13! But subsequent attempts to repeat this trade failed or were rejected. Player 0\u2019s current resource values per unit are: Wheat (5), Wood (10), Sheep (14), Brick (22). Success requires offering Player 1 something they value more than we do. Since Player 1 rejected low-value bundles (Wheat/Wood for Sheep/Brick), we must avoid those exact offers.  \n\n### Expert 2 (Resource Valuation Analyst):  \nPlayer 0\u2019s holdings after the first successful trade:  \n- **Wheat**: 6 \u00d7 5 = 30  \n- **Wood**: 9 \u00d7 10 = 90  \n- **Sheep**: 7 \u00d7 14 = 98  \n- **Brick**: 17 \u00d7 22 = 374  \n- **Ore**: 24 \u00d7 33 = 792  \nTotal value: **1,384**. Critical insight: Sheep has a high per-unit value (14) relative to Wheat (5) and Wood (10). Trading away low-value Wheat for Sheep increases total value. But Player 1 rejected 1 Wheat + 1 Wood for 2 Sheep twice\u2014suggesting they now undervalue Wheat/Wood. Alternate idea: Offer **1 Wheat alone** for **1 Sheep**. Why? Wheat (5) given for Sheep (14) is a net gain of +9! Player 1 might accept if they need Wheat (they\u2019ve taken it before), and we avoid Wood, which they\u2019ve rejected recently.  \n\n### Expert 3 (Behavioral Strategist):  \nPlayer 1\u2019s pattern: They accepted a 1W+1Wo\u21922S offer early but rejected it repeatedly later, even at better terms for them (e.g., offering less for Brick). This implies they\u2019ve recalibrated their needs\u2014likely avoiding Wheat/Wood bundles. Force a pivot: Offer a **new, asymmetric trade Player 1 hasn\u2019t seen**. 1 Wheat for 1 Sheep tests if they still value Wheat alone. Why it could work:  \n- Player 1 accepted Wheat bundled with Wood before\u2014may still need it.  \n- Sheep is abundant for Player 0, but gaining even one more adds 14 value in exchange for Wheat (5), a strong profit.  \nRisk: If rejected, no value loss since no trade occurs. Given this is the last turn, optimizing for potential gain > doing nothing.  \n\n**Unanimous Decision**:  \nAfter analyzing efficiency, resource value, and Player 1\u2019s behavior, all experts agree:  \n- Offer **1 Wheat** for **1 Sheep**.  \n- Avoid previously rejected bundles (no Wood).  \n- Maximize net value (+9 if accepted) and exploit Player 1\u2019s possible Wheat need.  \n\n### Player 0's Action:  \n**[Offer: 1 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]**",
