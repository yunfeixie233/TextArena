      "response": "### Thought Process:\n\nTo approach this negotiation game effectively, we need to consider multiple perspectives to maximize the total value of our resources. Here are three types of experts who can provide valuable insights:\n\n1. **Value Maximizer Expert**: Focuses on the current and potential future value of resources, aiming to trade low-value items for high-value ones.\n2. **Resource Balancer Expert**: Ensures that the quantities of resources are balanced to avoid shortages or surpluses, which could limit trading options.\n3. **Opportunist Expert**: Looks for immediate gains by exploiting favorable trades, even if they don\u2019t seem optimal at first glance.\n\nLet\u2019s have each expert provide their step-by-step thinking:\n\n---\n\n### Expert 1: Value Maximizer Expert\n**Step 1**: Calculate the total current value of my resources:\n- Wheat: 22 * 5 = 110\n- Wood: 10 * 11 = 110\n- Sheep: 10 * 15 = 150\n- Brick: 6 * 23 = 138\n- Ore: 19 * 39 = 741  \n**Total**: 110 + 110 + 150 + 138 + 741 = 1,249.\n\n**Step 2**: Identify the lowest and highest value resources. Wheat (5) and Wood (11) are the lowest, while Ore (39) and Brick (23) are the highest. Trades should aim to give away low-value items for high-value ones.\n\n**Step 3**: I have an overabundance of Wheat (22) and Ore (19), so I can offer some Wheat or Ore in exchange for more Brick or Sheep (since Brick is higher value and Sheep is medium).\n\n---\n\n### Expert 2: Resource Balancer Expert\n**Step 1**: Check for imbalances. I have 22 Wheat and 19 Ore, which are high quantities, but only 6 Brick, which is very low. This might limit my ability to trade later if Brick is needed.\n\n**Step 2**: Consider trading excess Ore (high value, high quantity) for Brick to balance the portfolio. For example, offering 2 Ore for 5 Brick would increase Brick from 6 to 11 while reducing Ore from 19 to 17.\n\n**Step 3**: Ensure no single resource drops too low (e.g., Brick shouldn\u2019t fall below 4-5, or it might be hard to trade back).\n\n---\n\n### Expert 3: Opportunist Expert\n**Step 1**: Look for trades that seem unfair in my favor. For example, if someone offers 3 Sheep for 5 Wheat, I might accept since Sheep is worth more (15 vs. 5), even if Sheep isn\u2019t a top priority.\n\n**Step 2**: Monitor offers from other players. If no offers are coming, proactively make an offer that seems generous but benefits me (e.g., offering 2 Ore for 5 Brick is a 78-for-115 value trade, heavily in my favor).\n\n**Step 3**: Act quickly in early turns to secure high-value trades before others catch on.\n\n---\n\n### Combined Strategy:\nThe experts agree on the following:\n1. **Primary Goal**: Trade excess low-value resources (like Wheat or some Ore) for high-value resources (Brick or more Sheep).\n2. **Initial Offer**: Make a reasonable offer to start negotiations.  \n   Example: [Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep] \u2013 This offers 3 Sheep + 2 Ore (45 + 78 = 123 value) for 5 Brick + 2 Sheep (115 + 30 = 145 value). Net: +22 value, but more importantly, increases Brick holdings.\n\n3. **Fallback**: If no one accepts, slightly sweeten the deal or try trading Wheat for Sheep.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer: [Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]",

A trade like 2 Wood + 2 Wheat for 1 Ore nets +4 value: we sacrifice 20 + 12 = 32 value for 36 gain.\"\n\nExpert 2 (Resource Balancer):  \n\"We have 25 Wood (surplus, low value) and 6 Ore (scarcity, high value). Sheep/Wheat are near-neutral (9 ea). Prioritize converting Wood/Wheat into Ore, not Sheep, to maintain equilibrium in higher-value resources. The 2 Wood + 2 Wheat for 1 Ore is optimal: it trims excess while replacing low-value with high-value. Trading Brick now would risk supply depletion (only 17) without reciprocal Ore gain.\"\n\nExpert 3 (Opponent Modeler):  \n\"Opponent\u2019s actions reveal a high Brick appetite: two offers proposing Ore/Sheep for Brick. Yet our 3 Wood for 1 Ore was rejected, suggesting Wood is undesirable standalone. Packaging Wood/Wheat makes it attractive \u2014 they might overlook low-value bulk. Also, they\u2019d gain resource flexibility. Post-rejection, escalating to 2 Wood + 2 Wheat for 1 Ore pressures them without compromising our core assets (Brick/Ore).\"\n\n**Unified Verdict:**\nWe propose **[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]**.  \n- **Gain Calculation**: Receive 1 Ore (36) vs. give 2\u00b710 (Wood) + 2\u00b76 (Wheat) = 32 \u2192 **Net +4 value**.\n- **Opportunity**: Leverages opponent\u2019s Brick fixation, avoids our high-value depletion.\n- **Resource Safety**: Wood/Wheat are abundant post-trade (23 Wood, 7 Wheat remain). Ore climbs to 7.  \nIf rejected, we retain optionality for future Brick-centric deals.",

      "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation carefully. Let me bring in three expert advisors who can help me maximize my trading value.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\n*Step 1: Calculate the current total value and identify the best trades*\nLooking at my current resources:\n- Wheat: 22\u00d75 = 110\n- Wood: 10\u00d711 = 110  \n- Sheep: 10\u00d715 = 150\n- Brick: 6\u00d723 = 138\n- Ore: 19\u00d739 = 741\nTotal value: 1,249\n\nThe rejection of my 3 Sheep, 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick, 2 Sheep offer is understandable. Giving 2 Ore (value 78) for 5 Brick (value 115) would be a net gain of 37, but apparently Player 1 values Ore highly too.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Scarcity Analyst**\n*Step 1: Analyze what's scarce for both parties*\nGiven that Player 1 has been offering Wood and Wheat trades, they likely have excess Wood and Wheat. They've been requesting Ore exclusively (both offers were \"give me Ore\"), suggesting they're Ore-starved. Meanwhile, I'm crafting offers for more Brick - the resource I'm shortest on at 6 units.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: The Marginal Value Calculator**\n*Step 1: Reject the current Wood/Wheat \u2192 Ore offer*\nPlayer 1 just offered: 2 Wood + 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore\nThat's (2\u00d711) + (2\u00d75) = 32 value for 39 value. Net loss of 7. \n[Deny]\n\nI should counter with an offer that leverages their apparent Ore scarcity and uses their excess resources.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Scarcity Analyst**\n*Step 2: Predict Player 1's likely resource distribution*\nSince Player 1 offered 3 Wood for 1 Ore earlier (rejected), and now 2 Wood + 2 Wheat for 1 Ore (rejected), they're clearly Wood wealthy and Ore poor. They have not offered Sheep, Brick, or Ore, so these might be their scarce resources.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\n*Step 2: Design mutually beneficial trades*\nGiven Player 1's Wood abundance and Ore need, I should offer Wood in exchange for Brick, which I need more of. \n\nCalculate: If I offer 3 Wood (33 value) for 4-5 Brick (92-115 value), Player 1 might accept since they value Wood much lower than I do. The marginal value of their 4th-5th Brick to me is extremely high since I only have 6 total.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: The Marginal Value Calculator**\n*Step 2: Craft optimal counter-offer*\nI'm Wood-poor (10 units) which makes Wood valuable to me. However, I'm even more Brick-poor (6 units). \n\nInstead of giving up Wood, I should offer Wheat (which I have 22 of, making its marginal value low) plus some Wood/Wheat mix for Brick, targeting that Player 1 likely has Brick but values Ore highly.\n\nLet me make a strategic offer:\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 3 Brick, 1 Sheep]\n\nThis combines their known Wood grinding with my Wheat excess to net 3 Brick (69 value gain) for relatively low-opportunity-cost resources on my side.",

      "response": "After careful analysis by our trading experts, we evaluate Player 0's offer of **4 Wheat and 1 Wood** in exchange for **3 Brick and 1 Sheep** as detrimental to our total resource value. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Value Analysis**:  \n   - We receive: 4 Wheat (4 \u00d7 6 = 24) + 1 Wood (1 \u00d7 10 = 10) \u2192 Total value: **34**.  \n   - We give: 3 Brick (3 \u00d7 21 = 63) + 1 Sheep (1 \u00d7 13 = 13) \u2192 Total value: **76**.  \n   - Net loss: 34 - 76 = **-42** in value. This significantly decreases our total portfolio.\n\n2. **Resource Impact**:  \n   - Losing 3 Brick and 1 Sheep depletes high-value resources. We have ample Wood (25) to cushion the loss of 1 Wood, but Wheat (9) is less plentiful, making the received 4 Wheat less useful.  \n   - Brick (21 value each) is our most valuable high-quantity resource, and Sheep (13) is moderately scarce. This trade sacrifices critical assets for low-value returns.\n\n3. **Historical Context**:  \n   - Player 0 consistently overvalues their offers and undervalues ours (e.g., rejecting our 3 Wood for 1 Ore deal, which gave us a +6 value gain).  \n   - They focus on acquiring Brick and Sheep, indicating these are in demand. Offering them at a loss would reinforce unfair terms.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\nTo increase our total value, we aim to trade our abundant low-value resources (Wood, Wheat) for high-value Ore (36). After prior rejections of Wood-based offers, we propose:\n\n- **Offer: 1 Sheep and 2 Wood \u2192 for 1 Ore**  \n  - We give: 1 Sheep (13) + 2 Wood (20) \u2192 Total: **33** value.  \n  - We receive: 1 Ore \u2192 **36** value.  \n  - Net gain: **+3** (converting low-utility resources into premium Ore).  \n  - Why it might work: Player 0 has shown interest in Sheep, and this deal offers them a slight profit (33 vs. Ore\u2019s 36) while preserving our Brick.\n\n**Action for this turn**:  \n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Thought Process:\n\nTo maximize Player 0's total resource value, we need to analyze the current holdings and identify the most valuable trades. Here are three expert perspectives:\n\n#### Expert 1: Value Maximizer\n- **Current Holdings:**\n  - Wheat: 22 * 5 = 110\n  - Wood: 10 * 11 = 110\n  - Sheep: 10 * 15 = 150\n  - Brick: 6 * 23 = 138\n  - Ore: 19 * 39 = 741\n  - **Total Value:** 110 + 110 + 150 + 138 + 741 = 1,249\n\n- **Strategy:** Focus on trading low-value resources (Wheat/Wood/Sheep) for high-value resources (Brick/Ore) to maximize the total value.\n- **Observation:** Ore is the most valuable (39), followed by Brick (23). Sheep (15), Wood (11), and Wheat (5) are lower. Any trade moving Sheep/Wood/Wheat into Brick/Ore is beneficial.\n\n#### Expert 2: Marginal Utility Analyst\n- **Strategy:** Evaluate how each trade affects marginal utility. Aim to shift from abundant low-value resources to scarce high-value resources.\n- **Observation:** Player 0 has 19 Ore (very valuable and already abundant) and 6 Brick (less abundant). Increasing Brick is beneficial if it doesn't sacrifice too much Ore.\n- **Trade Focus:** Offer trades where low-value resources (Sheep/Wheat/Wood) are exchanged for Brick or Ore, but avoid over-sacrificing Ore.\n\n#### Expert 3: Negotiation Simulator\n- **Strategy:** Simulate likely trades Player 1 might accept. Historically, Player 1 rejected offers unless they were highly favorable (e.g., 3 Sheep for 5 Brick was rejected).\n- **Observation:** Player 1 values Ore highly (offers 2 Wood + 2 Wheat for 1 Ore suggest Ore is worth ~2.5 low-value resources). Adjust offers to account for Player 1's valuation:\n  - Player 1\u2019s Ore ask: 2 Wood (22) + 2 Wheat (10) = 32 for 1 Ore (39). This is slightly favorable to Player 1 (32 vs 39).\n  - Player 1\u2019s latest offer: 1 Sheep (15) + 2 Wood (22) for 1 Ore (39). This is less favorable (37 vs 39).\n\n- **Adjusted Offer:** To secure Brick or Ore, offer trades where Player 1 gains slightly more value (e.g., give 1 Wood more than their ask). For Brick (23), a fair offer is ~2 Sheep (30) or 3 Wood (33).\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nCombine the insights:\n- **Offer:** 3 Sheep (45 total value) for 5 Brick (115 total value). This is a net gain of 70 for Player 0, but Player 1 rejected it (likely overvaluing Brick).\n- **Refined Offer:** Reduce the Brick ask slightly. Try 3 Sheep for **4 Brick** (92 vs 45, +47 for Player 0). This is more likely to be accepted than 5 Brick (115 vs 45, +70).\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 4 Brick]",
