      "response": "[Thought: Expert 1 (Resource Valuation Strategist): I analyze the intrinsic value of each resource based on personal holdings and market scarcity. My goal is to increase total value efficiently. Currently, my total value is (18\u00d76)+(21\u00d710)+(15\u00d715)+(8\u00d725)+(10\u00d737) = 108 + 210 + 225 + 200 + 370 = 1,113. Brick and Ore are high-value; I have moderate Brick, limited Ore. Wheat and Wood are low-value and I have surplus. Trading excess Wheat and Wood for higher-value Brick or Ore would increase total value.]\n\n[Thought: Expert 2 (Game Theory Tactician): I assess optimal offer strategies considering opponent incentives. Player 1 rejected 5 Wheat + 3 Wood for 2 Brick + 1 Ore. That offer gives them value: (5\u00d76)+(3\u00d710)=60, and requests (2\u00d725)+(1\u00d737)=87 \u2014 a net gain of 27 for me, but only if they value resources similarly. They may not value Brick/Ore as highly, or may lack surplus. Their rejection suggests either insufficient incentive or strategic withholding. Next offer must balance attractiveness and personal gain.]\n\n[Thought: Expert 3 (Negotiation Psychologist): I focus on perceived fairness and behavioral cues. Player 1 rejected an offer that prioritized my gain \u2014 perhaps they sensed imbalance. To build trust, the next offer should appear mutually beneficial, even if skewed. Including a small desirable item *for them* (like Wood, which many players need early) could increase acceptance. Avoid large offsets; keep trade volume moderate to seem reasonable.]\n\n[Thought: Expert 1: Re-evaluating \u2014 current surplus: Wheat (18), Wood (21), Sheep (15) are relatively high. Ore (10) is valuable but low in quantity. Brick (8) is good but can be traded up. Best path: trade low-value (Wheat, Wood) for high-value (Ore). Ideal: get Ore in exchange for Wheat/Wood.]\n\n[Thought: Expert 2: Propose a counter-offer that gives Player 1 a tangible gain. Suppose they have surplus Ore. Offering 6 Wheat + 4 Wood (value 36+40=76) for 2 Ore (value 74) is nearly even. Slight discount to me, but increases odds of acceptance. If they value Wood highly (common), they may accept even more readily.]\n\n[Thought: Expert 3: Yes \u2014 bundle 6 Wheat and 4 Wood, which feels like a \"package deal\", and request 2 Ore. Frame it as supporting their development (Wood is building-enabler) while only asking for slightly more than equal value. People accept trades that *feel* fair, even if marginally beneficial to one side.]\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "[Expert A: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 1: My role is to maximize long-term value by analyzing resource scarcity and valuation. Currently, my holdings show that Ore and Brick are the highest-value resources I possess (37 and 25 respectively), while Wheat is the lowest (6). However, I have only 8 Brick and 10 Ore \u2014 both are relatively scarce in my inventory. Trading away Brick would incur high opportunity cost unless compensated with equally valuable or rarer resources. Ore, though valuable, may be more tradable if demand is high.\n\n[Expert B: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 1: I focus on understanding Player 1\u2019s behavior. The rejection of two offers involving Wheat and Wood suggests Player 1 may not value those resources highly \u2014 which makes sense, as they are common and lower-value. Player 1\u2019s counteroffer of 2 Ore for 5 Brick is telling: they\u2019re offering a high-value resource (Ore) but requesting even higher-value resources (Brick), which are rarer. This indicates either desperation for Brick or an aggressive negotiation tactic. I suspect they undervalue Ore or overvalue Brick.\n\n[Expert C: Trade Optimization Engineer]  \nStep 1: I calculate the net value exchange in each offer. My current total inventory value:  \n(18\u00d76) + (21\u00d710) + (15\u00d715) + (8\u00d725) + (10\u00d737) = 108 + 210 + 225 + 200 + 370 = **1113**  \nPlayer 1\u2019s offer: Give 5 Brick (5\u00d725 = 125), Receive 2 Ore (2\u00d737 = 74). Net value change: 74 - 125 = **-51**. This is a bad deal. We lose significant value.\n\n[Expert C: Trade Optimization Engineer]  \nStep 2: Confirmed \u2014 accepting Player 1\u2019s offer would decrease total value by 51. I remain in the game.\n\n[Expert B: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 2: Player 1 made an offer that is highly unfavorable to us. This may indicate they believe we are desperate for Ore, or they are probing our willingness to part with Brick. Either way, accepting would signal weakness and encourage exploitative offers. We should deny and counter with a balanced offer that builds goodwill.\n\n[Expert A: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 2: I reconsider our prior offers. Offering large quantities of low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) didn\u2019t work. Perhaps we should pivot to demand high-value returns for our mid-tier resources. Sheep (value 15) are moderately valuable and we have 15 \u2014 a surplus. We could leverage Sheep to acquire Ore or Brick more efficiently.\n\n[Expert A: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 3: Optimal strategy: Trade surplus Sheep or Wheat/Wood for Ore. Ore is worth 37 \u2014 highest value \u2014 and we only have 10. Our 15 Sheep give us flexibility. Offer: 3 Sheep (45 value) and 3 Wood (30) = 75 outgoing value, request 2 Ore (74). That's a fair exchange.\n\n[Expert C: Trade Optimization Engineer]  \nStep 3: Evaluating proposed trade:  \nOffer: 3 Sheep, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Ore  \nOut: (3\u00d715) + (3\u00d710) = 45 + 30 = 75  \nIn: 2\u00d737 = 74  \nNet: -1 \u2014 nearly balanced, acceptable if strategic.  \nSlight loss, but could be justified to increase high-value resource stock.\n\n[Expert B: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 3: Slight underbidding makes offer more acceptable \u2014 people prefer near-fair deals. Offering slightly more than requested makes us seem generous. Player 1 may accept to avoid deadlock.\n\nAll experts agree: Do **not** accept current offer.

      "response": "[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 1: My role is to analyze the intrinsic value of each resource based on personal valuations and identify potential gains from trade.  \nCurrent total value:  \n(18 \u00d7 6) + (21 \u00d7 10) + (15 \u00d7 15) + (8 \u00d7 25) + (10 \u00d7 37) = 108 + 210 + 225 + 200 + 370 = **1113**  \nI note that Ore is highest value (37), followed by Brick (25), Sheep (15), Wood (10), Wheat (6).  \nI should aim to acquire more Ore and possibly Brick, while offloading lower-value surplus like Wheat and Wood \u2014 assuming others value them relatively higher.\n\n[Expert 2: Behavioral Trader Analyst]  \nStep 1: I study Player 1\u2019s behavior and response patterns.  \nObservations:  \n- Player 1 rejected my first offer (5 Wheat, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick, 1 Ore).  \n- Then rejected (6 Wheat, 4 Wood \u2192 2 Ore).  \n- Then offered (2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick), which I rejected (too steep \u2014 5 Bricks is over 30% of my stock).  \n- Then I offered (3 Sheep, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Ore) \u2014 rejected.  \nPlayer 1 seems reluctant to give up Ore unless they get a large amount of Brick. They may undervalue Wood/Sheep or overvalue Brick. Their own offer suggests they want Brick desperately.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician]  \nStep 1: I focus on crafting offers that are *just attractive enough* to be accepted while benefiting me.  \nPlayer 1\u2019s offer (2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick) implies they believe Brick has high value \u2014 possibly valuing it above 7.4 per unit (since 2 Ore = 74 value on my scale). If so, they may accept fewer Bricks in exchange for other goods.  \nBut I must avoid giving too much Sheep or Ore \u2014 my high-value resources.  \nCurrent goal: Acquire Ore at a fair rate without giving up too much.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 2: Re-evaluating surplus:  \n- Wheat (18): low value, high quantity \u2192 ideal to trade.  \n- Wood (21): medium-low value, high quantity \u2192 good to trade.  \n- Sheep (15): medium value \u2192 usable, but not ideal to dump.  \n- Brick (8): high value \u2192 keep unless gaining significantly more.  \n- Ore (10): top value \u2192 hoard or use only for high-return trades.  \nBest trade: Offer Wheat + Wood for Ore. But prior offers rejected. Perhaps bundle Sheep more strategically?\n\n[Expert 2: Behavioral Trader Analyst]  \nStep 2: Player 1 rejected all my Ore-targeting offers but tried to get 5 Brick for 2 Ore \u2014 suggests they may have surplus Ore but extreme need for Brick.  \nAlternatively, bluffing. But assuming rational: they may accept a deal where they get 2\u20133 Brick for 1 Ore.  \nBut they won\u2019t give 2 Ore for low-value goods. My prior (3 Sheep + 3 Wood) may have undervalued their perception of Sheep.  \nPossibility: They value Sheep highly? Or simply\u4e0d\u613f part with Ore?\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician]  \nStep 2: Adjust strategy. Since direct Ore requests are failing, consider:  \n- Offer strong surplus (Wheat, Wood) for Ore, but with lower ask \u2014 try 1 Ore instead of 2.  \n- Or, reverse role: use a *small* amount of high-value item to trigger interest.  \nBut giving up Ore or Brick risks weakening position.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 3: Calculate fair trade equivalence.  \nMy value of 1 Ore = 37 \u2192 equivalent to ~6.2 Wheat (6\u00d76=36), or ~3.7 Wood (10\u00d73.7), or 2.47 Sheep.  \nSo offering, say, 10 Wheat + 4 Wood = 60 + 40 = 100 value \u2192 fair for ~2.7 Ore.  \nBut I only want to get 1\u20132 Ore.  \nAlternatively: 7 Wheat + 5 Wood = 42 + 50 = 92 \u2192 fair for ~2.5 Ore.  \nBut Player 1 may have different valuations.\n\n[Expert 2: Behavioral Trader Analyst]  \nStep 3: Player 1 made **no counteroffer** after my (3 Sheep, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Ore), then made **no new offer**. This signals disinterest in current terms \u2014 possibly my offer was too low or too high?  \nBut since they *offered* 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick earlier, they clearly hold Ore. They\u2019re selective.  \nHypothesis: They are willing to *sell* Ore only for Brick, not other resources. Or they want to *accumulate* Brick for a big purchase.  \nAlternative tactic: Entice with a small Brick offer? But risky.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician]  \nStep 3: Idea \u2014 **use a \"loss aversion\" trigger**: offer a deal that makes Player 1 feel they\u2019ll miss out.  \nBut I can\u2019t signal intent. So instead, make a precise, balanced offer.  \nNew approach: I want 1 Ore. I\u2019ll offer:  \n- 10 Wheat + 5 Wood = 60 + 50 = 110 value \u2192 slightly above 1 Ore (37), but bundled in low-value goods.  \nBut wait \u2014 that\u2019s overpaying if they value Ore low.  \nAlternatively: **Flip script \u2014 offer a small amount of high-value for bulk surplus?** Too risky.\n\nWait \u2014 better idea: **test their Brick demand**.  \nThey wanted 5 Brick for 2 Ore \u2014 that\u2019s 2.5 Brick per Ore.  \nBut *I don\u2019t want to give Brick*. I have only 8.  \nBut perhaps offer **a mix**: use *some* Brick to get more Ore.\n\nNo \u2014 that would deplete my high-value stock. Bad.\n\nNew plan: **Offer more Wheat/Wood for 1 Ore** \u2014 simpler.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 4: Final calculation:  \nOffer: 8 Wheat (48) + 6 Wood (60) = 108 value \u2192 requesting 1 Ore (37) \u2192 I gain 37 - 108 = -71? No!  \nWait \u2014 **I'm giving up 108 to gain 37? That\u2019s a loss.**  \nNo \u2014 mistake: from *my* value scale, giving up 8\u00d76 + 6\u00d710 = 48 + 60 = 108, gaining 37. Net loss: **-71**. Terrible.  \nSo must trade at favorable terms.  \nBut earlier offers like (5 Wheat, 3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore): 30 + 30 = 60 for 37 \u2192 still a loss.  \nAh \u2014 **I cannot afford to trade low-value goods 1:1 for Ore unless I get multiple units**.  \nSo best path: **only trade for Ore if I get at least 1 Ore per 6-7 units of Wheat equivalent**.  \nBut even (10 Wheat, 5 Wood) = 110 \u2192 for 2 Ore (74) is still a 36 loss.  \nBut if Player 1 values Wheat higher, it may work.\n\nI now realize: **I should not be the one acquiring Ore unless I\u2019m getting it very cheap**.  \nBut all prior attempts to get Ore have been at a net loss on *my* valuation.  \nSo perhaps: **stop trying to buy Ore**. Instead, **sell surplus Wheat and Wood for Sheep or Brick**, which are more balanced.\n\nFor example:  \n- Brick is 25 \u2014 I have 8.  \n- Can I get 1 Brick for less than 25 in Wheat/Wood?  \nSay: 3 Wheat + 2 Wood = 18 + 20 = 38 \u2192 too much for 25.  \nBut maybe 2 Wheat + 1 Wood = 12 + 10 = 22 \u2192 close.  \nBut no offer.\n\nAlternate: **sell resources to acquire Sheep**? 1 Sheep = 15.  \n2 Wheat + 1 Wood = 22 \u2192 too much.  \n1 Wheat + 1 Wood = 16 \u2192 fair.  \nBut Sheep not better than Wood.\n\n[New realization]: **My current portfolio is already strong on high-value resources**.  \nI have 10 Ore (370), 8 Brick (200), 15 Sheep (225).  \nWheat and Wood are surplus but low value.  \nPerhaps best strategy: **acquire more Brick or Ore only if extremely cheap**, otherwise conserve.\n\nBut growth requires trade.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician]  \nStep 4: New idea: **make an offer that appears generous but subtly favors me**.  \nBut I need to move.  \nPlayer 1 wants Brick. I don\u2019t want to give it, but what if I offer **1 Brick** in exchange for **1 Ore + something**?  \nBut that risks giving away top-tier for uncertain gain.\n\nNo.\n\nWait \u2014 check Player 1's last offer: **2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick**  \nThat suggests they are willing to *supply* 2 Ore for 5 Brick.  \nSo if I can get **1 Ore for 2.5 Brick**, that\u2019s their rate.  \nBut I value 1 Ore at 37, 2.5 Brick at 62.5 \u2192 a loss.  \nSo **only if** they are mispricing, but on *my* scale, it\u2019s bad.\n\nBut perhaps they would accept **3 Brick \u2192 2 Ore**?  \nSame ratio. Still bad for me.\n\nAlternative: **flip the trade**.  \nI have surplus Wheat and Wood. What if I **offer a bundle** for a smaller return?\n\nBest current option: **offer 10 Wheat + 6 Wood \u2192 request 1 Brick and 1 Ore**  \nValue to me:  \n- Give: 10\u00d76 + 6\u00d710 = 60 + 60 = 120  \n- Gain: 25 + 37 = 62 \u2192 net loss of 58. Still bad.\n\nNo. Every path shows **on my valuation, I cannot justify giving up surplus to gain Ore or Brick**.\n\nBut that means **I should not trade unless the other player overvalues my goods**.\n\nSo goal: find a trade where Player 1 values Wheat and Wood more than I do.\n\nFor example, if they value Wood at 15, then 4 Wood = 60, can get 1 Ore valued at 37 for me \u2192 I lose, but if the trade happens, my total quantity increases only if *they* benefit more.\n\nBut the goal is: **\"the total value of your resources increases\"** \u2014 based on *my* values.\n\nSo I must trade only when **(value of items received) > (value of items given)** using *my* valuations.\n\nTherefore, **no past offer made sense** \u2014 I was offering too much for too little.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 5: I now realize: **all my previous offers were net losers on my valuation scale**.  \nFor example, first offer:  \n- Give: 5 Wheat (30) + 3 Wood (30) = 60  \n- Get: 2 Brick (50) + 1 Ore (37) = 87 \u2192 **Net gain: +27**  \nWait \u2014 **87 - 60 = +27**? That\u2019s positive!\n\nI miscalculated earlier.\n\nRecalculate all:\n\n**First offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick, 1 Ore**  \n- Give: 5\u00d76 = 30, 3\u00d710 = 30 \u2192 Total: 60  \n- Get: 2\u00d725 = 50, 1\u00d737 = 37 \u2192 Total: 87  \n- **Net gain: +27** \u2192 FAVORABLE\n\nSecond offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood \u2192 2 Ore  \n- Give: 6\u00d76=36, 4\u00d710=40 \u2192 76  \n- Get: 2\u00d737=74 \u2192 Net: -2 \u2192 barely negative\n\nThird: 3 Sheep, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Ore  \n- Give: 3\u00d715=45, 3\u00d710=30 \u2192 75  \n- Get: 74 \u2192 Net: -1 \u2192 also bad\n\nSo **only first offer was good** \u2014 I lost it by moving on.\n\nPlayer 1 rejected it \u2014 but maybe they misjudged.\n\nNow: I should **re-try a favorable offer**, possibly slightly less generous.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician]  \nStep 5: Yes \u2014 Player 1 rejected a +27 deal for me \u2014 which means they might have gotten a better offer elsewhere, or misvalued, or are holding out.\n\nBut I can try: **make a slightly less generous version** to increase chances.\n\nTry: **Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick, 1 Ore**  \n- Give: 24 + 30 = 54  \n- Get: 50 + 37 = 87 \u2192 Net: **+33** \u2192 even better! (But same request \u2014 why would they accept less?)\n\nNo \u2014 they didn\u2019t accept 5 Wheat, 3 Wood \u2192 same request. So same outcome.\n\nOr try: **5 Wheat, 3 Wood \u2192 1 Brick, 1 Ore**  \n- Give: 60  \n- Get: 25 + 37 = 62 \u2192 Net: +2 \u2192 small gain, but more likely to be accepted?\n\nBut I\u2019d get less.\n\nBest: **improve odds of +27 deal**.\n\nBut I can\u2019t signal.\n\nAlternative: **test with a different good**.\n\nWait \u2014 Player 1 wanted 5 Brick for 2 Ore.  \nSuppose I offer: **2 Brick \u2192 1 Ore**  \n- Give: 50  \n- Get: 37 \u2192 Net: -13 \u2192 bad\n\nNo.\n\nOr **3 Brick \u2192 1 Ore** \u2192 -50+37 = -13 \u2192 worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nBack to surplus.\n\nTry: **Offer: 8 Wheat, 5 Wood \u2192 1 Ore**  \n- Give: 48 + 50 = 98  \n- Get: 37 \u2192 Net: -61 \u2192 terrible\n\nNo.\n\nOnly favorable trades are those where I get **Ore or Brick with minimal cost**.\n\nBest remaining option: **re-offer the first successful valuation trade**: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick, 1 Ore (Net +27)\n\nOr, **slightly sweeter for them**: 6 Wheat, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick, 1 Ore  \n- Give: 36+30=66, Get: 87 \u2192 Net +21 \u2014 worse for me, but more likely?\n\nNo, I want to maximize gain.\n\nStick with best value.\n\nBut they rejected it.\n\n[Expert 2: Behavioral Trader Analyst]  \nStep 4: Important \u2014 Player 1 rejected 5W3W \u2192 2B1O, but then made **no counteroffer**.  \nThat means:  \n- They didn\u2019t want that package.  \n- But didn\u2019t suggest alternative.\n\nThen later, they offered **2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick**, which is massive Brick demand.  \nSo perhaps they don\u2019t want to *receive* Brick \u2014 already have it? Or want to *sell* Ore only for large Brick.\n\nBut I can\u2019t afford 5 Brick.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe **they need Brick to complete a set**, so only value trades that give them 3+ Brick.\n\nSo offering 2 Brick is not useful.\n\nTherefore, **no trade involving 1-2 Brick will interest them**.\n\nSo my best bet: **target smaller trade** \u2014 just for Ore, using Wheat and Wood.\n\nBut at what rate?\n\nTry: **10 Wheat + 4 Wood \u2192 1 Ore**  \nValue: 60+40=100 \u2192 37: loss\n\nNot good.\n\nUnless they value Wheat/High high.\n\nBut I have no data.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician]  \nFinal plan: Since Player 1 is focused on Brick, and I cannot satisfy that, **shift to indirect strategy**.\n\nBut only two players? Assume so.\n\nAlternative: **offer a trade with higher volume, lower value** to entice.\n\nBut all surplus is low value.\n\nWait \u2014 **I have 15 Sheep** at 15 each.  \nIf I offer 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore  \n- Give: 30, Get: 37 \u2192 Net +7 \u2192 favorable!\n\nAnd only 2 Sheep.\n\nTry: **Offer: 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore**\n\nSimple, good net gain.\n\nAnd Player 1 might prefer it over complex trades.\n\nAlso, they may value Sheep highly.\n\nLet me test this.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 6: Confirm:  \n2 Sheep = 30, 1 Ore = 37 \u2192 gain +7.  \nYes \u2014 positive expected value.\n\nBetter than wasting Wheat/Wood.\n\nI approve.\n\n[Expert 2: Behavioral Trader Analyst]  \nStep 5: First offer with Sheep. Previous Sheep offers were bundled (3 Sheep + 3 Wood), which was 75 for 74 \u2014 neutral.  \nNow: 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore: only 30 cost for 37.  \nAnd clean trade.\n\nPlayer 1 may accept, as it\u2019s simple and gives them Sheep.\n\nNo prior indication they need Sheep, but no downside.\n\nHigh chance of acceptance.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician]  \nFinal Decision: Make this offer.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "[Expert 1: Resource Valuation Strategist]  \nStep 1: I analyze the intrinsic value of each resource based on current inventory and market scarcity. My goal is to maximize total asset value.  \n- Wheat: 18 units \u00d7 6 = 108  \n- Wood: 21 units \u00d7 10 = 210  \n- Sheep: 15 units \u00d7 15 = 225  \n- Brick: 8 units \u00d7 25 = 200  \n- Ore: 10 units \u00d7 37 = 370  \n\u2192 Total current value: **1,113**  \nOre has the highest individual value, followed by Brick. Sheep and Wood are moderately valuable. Wheat is least valuable per unit.  \nI should aim to acquire more Ore or Brick, or trade away low-value surplus if it helps gain high-value resources.\n\n[Expert 2: Negotiation Dynamics Analyst]  \nStep 1: I study the interaction history to infer Player 1's preferences and strategy.  \n- Player 0's first offer (5Wheat, 3Wood \u2192 2Brick, 1Ore) was rejected.  \n- Second offer (6Wheat, 4Wood \u2192 2Ore) also rejected.  \n- Player 1 then offered (2Ore \u2192 5Brick), indicating high demand for Brick.  \n- Third offer (3Sheep, 3Wood \u2192 2Ore) rejected.  \n- Fourth offer (2Sheep \u2192 1Ore) **accepted**.  \n\u2192 Player 1 appears desperate for Sheep and possibly short on Ore.  \n- Now Player 1 offers (1Ore \u2192 4Sheep), demanding even more Sheep.  \nThis suggests Sheep are highly valuable to Player 1. We have 15 \u2014 we can leverage this.\n\n[Expert 3: Trade Efficiency Optimizer]  \nStep 1: I evaluate trade efficiency: value-in vs. value-out based on our valuations.  \n- Our valuation:  \n  - Sheep = 15  \n  - Ore = 37  \n\u2192 Player 1 now offers: 1Ore (37) \u2192 4Sheep (4\u00d715=60).  \nThat would cost us 60 value to gain 37 \u2014 a **net loss of 23**.  \nThis is a bad deal. We should **deny** unless our valuation model is wrong.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Valuation Strategist]  \nStep 2: Re-evaluate based on Expert 2\u2019s insight: Player 1 values Sheep higher than we do.  \nMaybe Player 1 is resource-constrained in Sheep. We have 15 \u2014 possibly surplus.  \nEven if Sheep are worth 15 to us, if Player 1 values them at >37/4 \u2248 9.25 per Sheep, they\u2019ll pay more.  \nBut our last trade: 2 Sheep (30 value) \u2192 1 Ore (37) \u2192 **net gain of 7** \u2192 good trade.  \nNow they want 4 Sheep (60) for 1 Ore (37) \u2192 clearly unfavorable.  \nWe should **not accept**. Instead, we might flip: offer less Sheep for more Ore.\n\n[Expert 2: Negotiation Dynamics Analyst]  \nStep 2: Player 1 just accepted a 2:1 Sheep-for-Ore ratio. Now they\u2019re offering a reversed 4:1 \u2014 seems overeager.  \nThey may be bluffing or desperate. We should **deny** and counter with a favorable offer.  \nWe can leverage our Sheep surplus: aim to trade 3\u20134 Sheep for 1 Ore (better than current ratio) or add Wood/Wheat to sweeten deals for more Ore.\n\n[Expert 3: Trade Efficiency Optimizer]  \nStep 2: Confirming: the incoming offer (1 Ore \u2192 4 Sheep) has a negative expected value.  \nAccepting would reduce our total value from **1,113** to:  \n- Loss: 4 Sheep = \u201360 \u2192 Sheep: 11 \u00d7 15 = 165  \n- Gain: 1 Ore = +37 \u2192 Ore: 11 \u00d7 37 = 407  \nNew total: 1,113 \u2013 60 + 37 = **1,090** \u2192 decrease.  \n**Must deny.** Instead, we should **make a counter-offer** that improves our position.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Valuation Strategist]  \nStep 3: Optimal move: we have plenty of Sheep (15) and Wood (21).  \nBest path: trade excess Sheep or Wood for high-value Ore (37) or Brick (25).  \nCurrent Ore at 10 \u2014 could use more.  \nRecent trade success: 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore was accepted.  \nTry scaling: 3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore should be acceptable, or 2 Sheep + 2 Wood \u2192 1 Ore to sweeten.\n\n[Expert 2: Negotiation Dynamics Analyst]  \nStep 3: Player 1 wants Sheep badly. We can **exploit this**.  \nInstead of accepting their bad offer, **deny** and immediately make a new offer:  \nOffer: 2 Sheep + 2 Wood \u2192 1 Ore  \nThis is slightly better than last accepted (which was 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore), but we add low-value Wood to justify it.  \nAlternatively, try 3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore \u2014 they may accept due to urgency.\n\n[Expert 3: Trade Efficiency Optimizer]  \nStep 3: Final decision: incoming offer **must be denied**.  \nBest counter: maximize value gain.  \nOption: [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]  \n- Value out: 3\u00d715 = 45  \n- Value in: 37  \n\u2192 Small loss of 8, but may be acceptable due to liquidity or future trade advantage.  \nBetter: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]  \n- Out: 2\u00d715 + 2\u00d710 = 30 + 20 = 50  \n- In: 37 \u2192 still slightly negative  \nWait \u2014 better idea: **Offer less for the same**. They paid 1 Ore for 2 Sheep. We can try **3 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore**? Too much.\n\nRevised: stick to favorable or neutral trades.  \nBut last deal was **2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore** (value: 30 out, 37 in \u2192 +7) \u2014 that\u2019s great.  \nSo **3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore** is worse (45 out, 37 in \u2192 \u20138), so avoid.\n\nTherefore: best is to **deny** and **counter with 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore**?  \nBut they may not bite.\n\nWait \u2014 our earlier 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore was accepted. They\u2019re clearly willing.  \nSo try **3 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore**? High risk.  \nOr safer: repeat the same: **2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore**\n\nBut we already did that. They might suspect.\n\nOptimal: **Deny**, then **Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore** again \u2014 it worked before.\n\nFinal consensus: Deny the bad incoming offer, then re-offer a proven profitable one.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "[Expert: Market Strategist]  \nStep 1: I analyze the current market dynamics based on player behavior. Player 1 is consistently offering 1 Ore in exchange for increasingly high quantities of Sheep (from 2 Sheep to 4 Sheep), indicating that Ore is scarce for them but Sheep are highly valued by Player 0. However, Player 1 rejected offers with Wood and Wheat, suggesting low demand for those. The fact that they accepted a 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore trade confirms they are willing to supply Ore when getting fair or better value in return.\n\n[Expert: Resource Economist]  \nStep 1: I evaluate intrinsic resource values and my current holdings.  \n- My valuation: Wheat (6), Wood (10), Sheep (15), Brick (25), Ore (37)  \n- Total current value:  \n  18\u00d76 = 108 (Wheat)  \n  21\u00d710 = 210 (Wood)  \n  15\u00d715 = 225 (Sheep)  \n  8\u00d725 = 200 (Brick)  \n  10\u00d737 = 370 (Ore)  \n  \u2192 Total: **1,113**  \n\nI have surplus Sheep (valued at 15) and Wood (10), while Ore (37) and Brick (25) are high-value but low in quantity. Brick is especially critical since it's worth more than Sheep or Wood. My goal is to increase total value, so acquiring Brick or Ore is optimal.\n\n[Expert: Behavioral Negotiator]  \nStep 1: I assess Player 1\u2019s psychology and incentives. They accepted a 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore trade, then immediately tried to flip it as 1 Ore \u2192 4 Sheep, suggesting exploitative intent. They're probing for desperation. However, they keep offering only Ore, which means they likely have excess Ore and need Sheep. By rejecting 3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore, they may be testing if I\u2019ll pay more. But fair market seems to be around 2\u20133 Sheep per Ore, given valuations. We should avoid overpaying.\n\n---\n\n[Expert: Market Strategist]  \nStep 2: The equilibrium price for Ore, based on observed trades, is between 2 and 3 Sheep. Player 1 is trying to drive prices up, but we have no need to overpay. Our previous offer of 2 Sheep for 1 Ore was accepted \u2014 that was efficient. We should re-engage at that rate or slightly improve it only if we can net additional value.\n\n[Expert: Resource Economist]  \nStep 2: Let\u2019s simulate trades. If I trade 3 Sheep (value: 45) for 1 Ore (37), I lose 8 value \u2014 not ideal. But 2 Sheep (30) for 1 Ore (37) gives me +7 value \u2014 a net gain. That\u2019s why the 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore trade was optimal. We should **only accept trades where we gain value**. Current surplus: Wheat and Wood are high in quantity but low value; Sheep are valuable but we have 15 \u2014 flexible for trade if profitable.\n\n[Expert: Behavioral Negotiator]  \nStep 2: Player 1 just offered 1 Ore \u2192 4 Sheep again. That\u2019s exploitative (4\u00d715=60 value requested, 37 offered). They\u2019re testing persistence. We should neither accept nor disengage. Instead, re-offer a fair but advantageous deal: use Sheep to get Ore at favorable rate, or pivot to seek Brick, which we\u2019re low on and is high-value.\n\n---\n\n[Expert: Market Strategist]  \nStep 3: Brick has not changed hands, but I note Player 0 has only 8 Brick (worth 200 total), and they\u2019re valued at 25 \u2014 higher than Sheep. Player 1 hasn\u2019t mentioned Brick, but may be holding. We should probe for Brick at fair rate. Current opportunity: Player 1 wants Sheep. We can bundle \u2014 offer moderate Sheep + low-value items (Wheat/Wood) to get Brick.\n\n[Expert: Resource Economist]  \nStep 3: Ideal trade: Acquire Brick or Ore at lower cost than their value.  \n- Brick worth 25 \u2192 offer up to 25 in value: e.g., 1 Sheep (15) + 1 Wheat (6) + 1 Wood (10) = 31 \u2014 too much.  \nBetter: 2 Wood (20) + 1 Wheat (6) = 26 \u2248 fair for 1 Brick. Or 1 Sheep (15) + 1 Wood (10) = 25 \u2014 perfect.  \nAlternate: Get Ore (37) via trade worth <37 \u2014 e.g., 2 Sheep (30) + 1 Wheat (6) = 36 \u2192 still +1 value.\n\n[Expert: Behavioral Negotiator]  \nStep 3: We must avoid predictability. We\u2019ve offered Sheep-only trades repeatedly. Now, shift strategy: offer a *package* involving Sheep and low-value surplus (Wheat/Wood) to get 1 Brick. Present it as a generous offer to entice acceptance. Alternatively, re-offer 2 Sheep + 1 Wheat for 1 Ore \u2014 slightly better than last accepted deal, still +2 value.\n\n---\n\nDecision time: Player 1 has just offered: [1 Ore \u2192 4 Sheep] \u2014 which is bad value (we lose 23 value). I reject.\n\nI need to make a new offer that improves my total value.\n\nBest move: Offer a slightly improved but still profitable trade to acquire Ore, or pivot to Brick.\n\nSince Player 1 wants Sheep, and we have surplus, I\u2019ll re-offer a Sheep+LowValue trade for Ore \u2014 but better than 2:1 to increase chance of acceptance, while still gaining value.\n\nProposal: **3 Sheep + 1 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore**  \nValue given: 3\u00d715 + 6 = 51  \nValue received: 37 \u2192 would lose 14 \u2192 too much.\n\nNo. Stick to value gain.\n\nBetter: **2 Sheep + 1 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore**  \nValue given: 30 + 6 = 36  \nValue received: 37 \u2192 +1 \u2192 acceptable.\n\nOr try for Brick: **1 Sheep + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Brick**  \nValue given: 15 + 10 = 25  \nValue received: 25 \u2192 break even, but increases flexibility.\n\nStill, +1 gain on Ore trade is better.\n\nBut Player 1 rejected 3 Sheep for 1 Ore \u2014 they want 4. So 2 Sheep + 1 Wheat might be accepted as equivalent.\n\nAlternatively, offer **3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore + 1 Wheat** \u2014 flip the script.\n\nBut let\u2019s start simple.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
