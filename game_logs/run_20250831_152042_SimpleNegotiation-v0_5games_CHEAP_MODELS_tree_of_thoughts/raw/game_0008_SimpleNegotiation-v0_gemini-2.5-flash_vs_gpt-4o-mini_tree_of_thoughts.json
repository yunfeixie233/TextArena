      "response": "The game is about increasing the total value of my resources. I need to make trades that achieve this.\n\nHere are the experts I'll consult:\n\n*   **The Value Strategist:** This expert focuses on maximizing the immediate value gain from each trade, prioritizing high-value resources and understanding the inherent worth of current holdings versus potential acquisitions. They think in terms of return on investment.\n*   **The Resource Flow Analyst:** This expert looks at the overall quantity and liquidity of resources. They'll advise on maintaining a healthy inventory, avoiding shortages, and ensuring I have enough of various resources to make future trades desirable to others. They might suggest trading away excess cheaper resources for fewer, more valuable ones to free up inventory space.\n*   **The Scarcity & Demand Expert:** This expert considers what resources are generally sought after or are in low supply, both for myself and potentially for my opponents (though I don't know my opponents' resources yet). They will advise on leveraging my abundant resources to acquire difficult-to-get or highly demanded resources, even if the immediate value gain isn't immense, because it sets up better future trades.\n\n---\n\n**Current Resources:**\n*   Wheat: Qty: 7, Value: 5 (Total Value: 35)\n*   Wood: Qty: 19, Value: 11 (Total Value: 209)\n*   Sheep: Qty: 14, Value: 17 (Total Value: 238)\n*   Brick: Qty: 13, Value: 23 (Total Value: 299)\n*   Ore: Qty: 8, Value: 35 (Total Value: 280)\n\n**Total Current Value:** 35 + 209 + 238 + 299 + 280 = 1061\n\n---\n\n**Turn 1**\n\n**Value Strategist:** My primary goal is to increase my total resource value. I should look for trades where the value of resources I acquire significantly exceeds the value of resources I give up. Currently, Ore is my most valuable resource per unit, followed by Brick. Wood and Wheat are my least valuable. I have a large quantity of Wood (19 units) and Sheep (14 units).\n\n**Resource Flow Analyst:** I have an abundance of Wood and Sheep. High quantities of low-value resources can be inefficient for future trades if they take up too much inventory space, or if I want to make high-value trades. I should consider offloading some of my plentiful Wood or Sheep to acquire higher-value resources, even if it means reducing my quantity of items. My Brick and Ore counts are good, not too low to prevent trades involving them.\n\n**Scarcity & Demand Expert:** While I don't know what my opponents have, Wood tend to be a commonly needed resource in many trading games due to its lower value and general utility. Players might always need Wood for various purposes. Since I have a lot of Wood, I can offer it as a sweetener in trades for more valuable resources. Ore and Brick are typically high-demand resources because of their higher value and often being components for powerful purchases. My ample supply of Sheep could also be traded, possibly for other mid-to-high value resources like Brick or Ore.\n\n---\n**Turn 1, Continued**\n\n**Value Strategist:** Given my large quantity of Wood and its low value, I should try to trade Wood for something much more valuable, like Ore or Brick. For instance, trading several units of Wood (e.g., 3-4 Wood for 1 Ore) would be a good value proposition if the total value gained is higher than the loss. My focus for the first trade is to establish a good value ratio. A trade like \"3 Wood (Value 33) for 1 Brick (Value 23)\" is bad for me. I need the net value acquired to be positive. I ideally want to trade my lower value resources for high ones at a favorable rate. Let's aim to at least break even or slightly gain on a per-unit basis while using my abundant low-value resources.\n\n**Resource Flow Analyst:** I want to reduce my Wood quantity to a more manageable level and increase my holdings of higher-value items. Since I have 19 Wood, I can afford to offer a generous amount of it to get scarce or high-value resources. I should aim for an offer that is attractive to another player, leveraging my surplus. Perhaps 4-5 Wood for 1 Ore, or 3-4 Wood for 1 Brick. This helps balance my inventory.\n\n**Scarcity & Demand Expert:** Wood is a good resource to offer because its omnipresent demand means it's likely someone needs it. I should offer a significant quantity of Wood to make a deal attractive. What if I aim to trade Wood for Brick? Brick is valuable, and I have a good quantity of it, but getting more would increase my overall value and diversify my high-value holdings. Aim for a trade that takes advantage of my Wood surplus to acquire something highly desirable: perhaps 5 Wood for 2 Brick, or 4 Wood for 1 Ore.\n\n---\n**Turn 1, Continued (Decision)**\n\n**Value Strategist:** My goal is to increase total value. I have 19 Wood (Value 11 each) and 14 Sheep (Value 17 each). I want to acquire Ore (Value 35) or Brick (Value 23). A good trade would be offering a quantity of low-value resources for a smaller quantity of high-value resources where the total value of what I receive is greater than what I give. For example, 4 Wood (Value 44) for 2 Brick (Value 46) would be a net gain of +2 value, and I'd shed low-value resources. 5 Wood (Value 55) for 2 Ore (Value 70) would be excellent (+15 value).\n\n**Resource Flow Analyst:** I have too much Wood. I need to bring that quantity down. I'm willing to slightly sweeten the deal to move a lot of it. I want to aim for a trade that reduces my Wood by at least 4-5 units. Acquiring Ore or Brick would be ideal.\n\n**Scarcity & Demand Expert:** I suspect players will need Wood. I can use the abundance of my lowest-value resource to aggressively acquire a high-value resource. Offering a good ratio for Ore or Brick is wise. Given my large Wood quantity, an offer of 5 Wood for 2 Ore seems very good for me in terms of value increase and getting rid of excess. If 2 Ore is too much, then perhaps 5 Wood for 2 Brick or even 1 Ore + 1 Brick. Let's go for an ambitious trade that benefits me significantly in value.\n\n**Final Decision Process:** I'm making an offer based on these considerations. I want to trade away Wood especially, as it's my lowest-value and most abundant resource. Ore is the most valuable resource unit-for-unit. A trade of 5 Wood for 2 Ore would be a value gain of (2 * 35) - (5 * 11) = 70 - 55 = +15. This is a very strong value gain and moves a significant quantity of my lowest-value resource.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]",

Let's analyze the situation from three different perspectives with three experts.\n\n### Expert 1: The Resource Strategist\n1. **Analysis**: I observe that Player 1 has a substantial amount of Ore with a value of 33 each, while their Wood has a lower value of 11 each. Trading 5 Wood for 2 Ore would yield a value of 22 (5 Wood * 11) for 66 (2 Ore * 33). This trade seems beneficial.\n2. **Recommendation**: I suggest to accept this trade because it significantly increases Player 1's resource value.\n\n### Expert 2: The Risk Assessor\n1. **Analysis**: While the initial trade appears beneficial, I must consider whether Player 1 may need more Wood in future trades or developments. Player 1 has 8 Wood, which may serve as a strategic advantage for further transactions.\n2. **Recommendation**: I recommend to deny the offer. Maintaining Wood could provide better trading opportunities later.\n\n### Expert 3: The Value Maximizer\n1. **Analysis**: The essential point is to maximize the overall trading value. If we analyze the numbers, trading 5 Wood for 2 Ore does result in an increase in overall resource value. Thus, the immediate value gained from Ore is pertinent.\n2. **Recommendation**: I support accepting the trade as it allows for immediate value growth.\n\nNow consolidating the insights from the experts, we have two accepting the trade and one advising denial. Given that the trade will increase the total value, Player 1 should proceed.\n\n### Action\nI choose to follow the majority recommendation based on value increase.\n\n[Accept]",

I will look for opportunities to trade low-value resources for high-value resources.\n\n**Expert 2: The Quantity Balancer**\nI believe a balanced inventory is key to flexibility. I will aim to diversify your holdings and avoid having too much of one resource, especially if its value is low.\n\n**Expert 3: The Strategic Forecaster**\nI will analyze past trades and anticipate future market trends. I'll look for resources that might become more valuable or scarcer, and suggest trades that position you well for the long term.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nYour current total value is: (7 * 5) + (19 * 11) + (14 * 17) + (13 * 23) + (8 * 35) = 35 + 209 + 238 + 299 + 280 = 1061. The last trade was 5 Wood (55 value) for 2 Ore (70 value), which was a net gain of 15 value. This was a good move.\n\n**Expert 2: The Quantity Balancer**\nYou have a lot of Wood (19) and Sheep (14) compared to Wheat (7) and Ore (8). While Wood has a decent value, having too much might limit future high-value trades.\n\n**Expert 3: The Strategic Forecaster**\nPlayer 1 seemed interested in Ore. That might be a consistent demand. Let's consider what other players might need or want that we have in abundance. We also want to acquire more high-value items like Ore or Brick.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nWe have a large quantity of Wood (value 11) and Sheep (value 17). Ore (value 35) and Brick (value 23) are the most valuable per unit. We should continue to convert lower-value resources into higher-value ones.\n\n**Expert 2: The Quantity Balancer**\nGiven our high quantity of Wood and Sheep, and their relatively lower values compared to Brick and Ore, it makes sense to try and reduce our stock of these to gain more valuable and potentially scarcer resources.\n\n**Expert 3: The Strategic Forecaster**\nPlayer 1 just took Ore from us. This indicates a demand. If we can get profitable trades for Wood or Sheep that give us more Ore or Brick, that would be ideal. We should aim for trades where the value increment is significant per unit.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nI recommend offering a larger quantity of Wood or Sheep in exchange for Ore or Brick. For example, 5 Wood (value 55) for 2 Brick (value 46) is a slight loss, but 5 Wood (value 55) for 1 Ore (value 35) is a significant loss. However, we have a lot of Wood. Let's consider 11 Wood for 4 Brick. That is 121 for 92, still a loss. The key is to find ratios that favor us. Let's try to convert a large amount of low-value into a smaller amount of high-value with a positive net change.\n\n**Expert 2: The Quantity Balancer**\nLet's try to get rid of some Wood or Sheep. We have enough to offer a generous amount to entice other players, especially if we target Ore or Brick. We could aim for 10 Wood or 7 Sheep for a smaller quantity of Ore or Brick.\n\n**Expert 3: The Strategic Forecaster**\nSince Player 1 accepted our last offer for Ore, it suggests they may still be open to similar trades. We need to find a new offer that is still attractive to them, but even more profitable for us. Consider offering a relatively large quantity of Wood or Sheep for 1-2 units of Ore or Brick, trying to ensure a positive value exchange.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nLet's try to get more Ore. We have 19 Wood. Offering 10 Wood (value 110) for 3 Ore (value 105) is a slight loss. How about 10 Wood for 4 Brick (value 92)? Still not ideal. We need to be aggressive. What about 7 Sheep (value 119) for 3 Ore (value 105)? Slight loss. Let's try 5 Wood for 2 Ore again, but we already did that. We need a new profitable trade.\n[Offer: 8 Wood -> 3 Brick] (Value of 8 Wood = 88, Value of 3 Brick = 69. This is a negative value trade. Expert 1 is wrong here. Expert 1 leaves.)\n\n**Expert 2: The Quantity Balancer**\nMy goal is to reduce our highly accumulated resources while gaining others. Given the large quantity of Wood, let's offer a significant portion of it to acquire a more valuable and less abundant resource like Brick or Ore. I suggest offering about half our current Wood.\n[Offer: 9 Wood -> 3 Brick]\n\n**Expert 3: The Strategic Forecaster**\nPlayer 1 wanted Ore, and we have the most Wood. We previously made a good trade. Let's see if we can get even more value. If we offer a substantial amount of Wood, we might be able to get a good amount of Brick or Ore in return. Since Player 1 is still in the game, they might be looking for more Wood for building. Let's try for 3 Ore for a large amount of Wood.\n[Offer: 11 Wood -> 3 Ore]",

I'll also think about what resources Player 1 might value more based on their current inventory, and how to exploit that for future trades. My aim is to make trades that open doors for even more valuable exchanges later.\n\n**Expert 3: The Value Arbitrageur**\n*Initial Thought:* I will calculate the current value of the resources we are giving and receiving in the proposed offer. I will then compare this to the inherent value of each resource. My focus is on finding disparities in perceived value between players to execute advantageous trades.\n\n***\n\n**Expert 1: The Resource Maximizer**\n*Thought:*\nLet's analyze the current offer: [Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick].\nValue of resources offered: (4 Wood * 11) + (2 Sheep * 17) = 44 + 34 = 78.\nValue of resources requested: (3 Brick * 23) = 69.\nThis proposed trade results in a loss of 9 value (78 - 69). This is an unfavorable trade based purely on immediate value. We should deny this offer. Our current Brick quantity is high, so we don't desperately need more anyway.\n\n**Expert 2: The Strategic Trader**\n*Thought:*\nPlayer 1 is offering 4 Wood and 2 Sheep for 3 Brick. Player 1 currently has 0 Brick, making it highly valuable to them. However, for us, we have 19 Brick, so acquiring more Brick is not a priority, especially if it means a value loss. Player 1 also has a very limited supply of Wheat (1) and relatively few Sheep (5). Our strength is in Brick, Sheep (14), and Ore (10). We should aim to leverage our high Brick quantity for resources we value more or that Player 1 values more, like Ore or Wheat, in subsequent trades, rather than deplete valuable Wood and Sheep for more Brick.\n\n**Expert 3: The Value Arbitrageur**\n*Thought:*\nThe proposed offer is 4 Wood (4 * 11 = 44) + 2 Sheep (2 * 17 = 34) = 78 value offered.\nWe receive 3 Brick (3 * 23 = 69) value.\nThe trade results in a net loss of 9 value. This is a bad deal. Player 1 is trying to get Brick, which they sorely lack (0 Brick), and we have an abundance of it (19 Brick). While this creates a potential for value exploitation in concept, this particular offer is not it. We should not accept this as it directly reduces our total value.\n\n***\n\n**Expert 1: The Resource Maximizer**\n*Thought:*\nSince the offer is unfavorable, we must deny it. Following that, we need to consider what offer to make next to increase our value. Our current valuable resources are Ore (35 value) and Brick (23 value). Player 1 has very little Brick and relatively little Sheep and Wheat. They might be willing to pay a premium for Brick. We should try to trade our abundant Brick for resources that are high value or that Player 1 is short on, like Ore or Wheat, while ensuring a positive value exchange for us.\n\n**Expert 2: The Strategic Trader**\n*Thought:*\nDenying the current offer is crucial. Instead of accepting a bad deal for Brick, we should capitalize on Player 1's need for Brick. We have a lot of Brick. We could offer a smaller amount of Brick for a high-value resource from Player 1, or for a resource they value less but we value more in quantity (like Wheat for future trading). Given their scarcity, they might overpay. We should aim for an offer that gives us scarce resources like Wheat or increases our high-value resources like Ore by leveraging our abundant Brick.\n\n**Expert 3: The Value Arbitrageur**\n*Thought:*\nI agree with denying the offer. The value difference is too significant. Now, let's consider a counter-offer. Player 1 explicitly needs Brick. We have 19 Brick. We can afford to sell Brick at a slight premium, if we can get resources that offer a higher intrinsic value to us or are undervalued by Player 1. Given Player 1's low Wheat and Sheep, we might be able to get 1-2 Ore in exchange for some Brick, which would be a high-value gain for us. What if we offer a smaller quantity of Brick for something Player 1 has but holds less value for them, such as some of their Sheep or even their limited Wheat? However, an exchange for Ore would be the most direct high-value gain.\n\n***\n\n**Expert 1: The Resource Maximizer**\n*Thought:*\nGiven our high quantity of Brick (19) and Player 1's lack of it (0), we can leverage this. We should try to trade Brick for Ore, as Ore is our highest value resource. If Player 1 is desperate for Brick, they might agree to a favorable exchange rate for us. Let's propose an offer where we give a small amount of Brick for a significant amount of Ore to maximize our value gain.\n\n**Expert 2: The Strategic Trader**\n*Thought:*\nGiven Player 1's critical need for Brick, we have a strong negotiation position. We should aim to trade our excess Brick for something that is both high in value and scarce for us, like Ore or Wheat, or even an amount of Wood given our recent trades. Since we just traded Wood and still have plenty of Ore, pushing for more Ore or Wheat from Player 1 using our Brick seems strategic to both increase our high-value resources and diversify from our Brick abundance.\n\n**Expert 3: The Value Arbitrageur**\n*Thought:*\nTo maximize value, we need to acquire resources worth more than what we offer. Player 1 has 5 Ore (value 35 each) and 1 Wheat (value 5 each). We have 19 Brick (value 23 each). A very favorable trade would be to exchange Brick for Ore. For example, if we offer 1 Brick (value 23) for 1 Ore (value 35), that's a +12 value gain. Player 1 needs Brick, and we have plenty. This is a clear arbitrage opportunity. Let's aim for that if we can. If not, even 2 Brick for 1 Ore is a net gain (46 vs 35, loss of 11), which is not good. We need to be careful with the ratio. A better ratio might be for multiple Brick, for example, 2 Brick for 2 Ore is perfect parity assuming equal numbers. But we want a win. Maybe 1 Brick for 1 Ore is too much to ask. Let's consider 2 Brick for 1 Ore and 1 Sheep or similar to make it balanced, or simply leverage on their need for Brick to improve our Ore count. What about offering 2 or 3 Brick for 1 Ore? Let's check: 2 Brick (46) for 1 Ore (35) is a loss for us. 3 Brick (69) for 1 Ore (35) is a loss. We need to get more quantity of lower value (Sheep, Wood, even their Wheat) or an equal value of higher value. Let's try to get Ore. Given Player 1's limited resources, maybe they'll trade 1 Ore for something they desperately need to get on the board.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "In this negotiation game scenario, it would be helpful to have three different types of trading experts to provide a comprehensive analysis. Here are the experts I suggest:\n\n1. **Value Maximization Expert**: This expert focuses on identifying the most valuable trades that could maximize the total resource value.\n2. **Risk Assessment Expert**: This expert evaluates the risks of accepting certain trades and can deter possible pitfalls that may arise from poor trades.\n3. **Market Trends Expert**: This expert attends to the current market trends and dynamics, considering how resource supply and demand can affect trade decisions.\n\n### Expert Analysis Steps\n\n**Step 1: Value Maximization Expert Analysis**\n- Current Total Value Analysis:\n  - Wheat: 13 * 5 = 65\n  - Wood: 8 * 11 = 88\n  - Sheep: 14 * 14 = 196\n  - Brick: 5 * 27 = 135\n  - Ore: 7 * 33 = 231\n  - **Total Value**: 65 + 88 + 196 + 135 + 231 = **715**\n  \n- Proposed Trade Value:\n  - Player 0's latest offer to trade 8 Wood for 3 Brick:\n    - Value of 8 Wood: 8 * 11 = 88\n    - Value of 3 Brick: 3 * 27 = 81\n    - **Net Gain/Loss**: 81 (Brick) - 88 (Wood) = **-7** (a loss).\n\n- Conclusion: Accepting Player 0\u2019s offer would reduce total resource value. I'd advise **[Deny]**.\n\n**Step 2: Risk Assessment Expert Analysis**\n- Risks with Current Offers:\n  - Further trades involving Wood may deplete Player 1's stock of a moderately valuable resource without appropriate return, as seen in the recent offer from Player 0.\n  - The rejection of the latest offer involving 4 Wood and 2 Sheep may impact Player 1's negotiation position if resources diminish unexpectedly and can lead to undesirable trades in future turns.\n\n- Advice: Monitor for better offers and strengthen resource positions, particularly with Brick and Ore which have higher individual values. Based on analysis, reject current trade offers. I would recommend **[Deny]**.\n\n**Step 3: Market Trends Expert Analysis**\n- Analyzing Current Market Dynamics:\n  - There appears to be a demand for both Brick and Ore which indicates that holding onto higher-value resources like Ore could be more beneficial in the long run.\n  - Wood is being offered in excess by Player 0, suggesting it's either in lower demand or they are simply overstocked, indicating potential leverage in future trades.\n\n- Conclusion: Given the high value and demand for Ore, it\u2019s best to keep offering lower-value resources (like Wood and Sheep) while holding onto high-value resources such as Ore. Based on this analysis, I would also suggest **[Deny]**.\n\n### Final Decision\n- Following the combined analysis from all experts, it is clear that accepting the latest trade offer would not be beneficial for maximizing resource value or reducing risk.

I should always be looking to acquire more of it, especially if I can give away lower-value resources for it. Also, I have a decent quantity of [Sheep] and [Brick]. If I can use these to get more [Ore] or other high-value resources, that's a good move. Player 1 also has a lot of [Wood] if I remember correctly, and I've been giving them wood. Maybe I should try to get value *from* them for my high-value items, or consolidate my resources.\n\n### Expert 2: The Strategist (Focus on Long-Term Goals and Resource Ratios)\n\n**Step 1:** My current resource distribution shows a good amount of [Sheep], [Brick], and [Ore]. My [Wheat] and [Wood] quantities are lower. Ideally, I want to increase my total value, but also maintain a balanced set of resources for potential future needs (even though I don't know what they are yet). Looking at past trades, Player 1 seems willing to trade [Wood] for [Brick]. I just traded a lot of [Wood] for [Brick] and [Ore]. I have a lot of [Brick] now. Could I trade [Brick] for something even more valuable, or at least for resources I have less of?\n\n### Expert 3: The Market Analyst (Focus on Past Trades and Player Behavior)\n\n**Step 1:** Player 1 has accepted a lot of my offers where I give [Wood] for [Brick] or [Ore]. This suggests they value [Brick] and [Ore] highly, or they have a surplus of [Wood] and are willing to part with it cheaply. They rejected my last offer of \"4 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick\". This tells me that they either don't want 4 Wood and 2 Sheep for 3 Brick, or they value their Brick even more. Given that I have 16 [Brick] myself now, perhaps I can offer some of my [Brick] for something I need more, or for a resource that I anticipate will become more valuable. I have a lot of [Sheep] too. Maybe I can offer some [Sheep] for something else.\n\n### Consolidated Plan:\n\nFrom Expert 1, I want high-value trades. From Expert 2, I need to consider my resource balance - I have a lot of [Sheep] and [Brick]. From Expert 3, Player 1 resisted trading 3 Brick for 4 Wood and 2 Sheep. This suggests they value [Brick] highly, or they don't value my offer enough. I have a lot of [Brick]. Maybe I can overvalue some of my own [Brick] and trade it for [Ore] or [Wheat]?\n\nLooking back, I traded 8 Wood (Value 88) for 3 Brick (Value 69). This was a bad trade value-wise, but I consolidated my resources. I need to be more careful about the value.\nMy goal is to increase my total value.\n\nPlayer 1 rejected \"4 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick\". My value offered: (4 * 11) + (2 * 17) = 44 + 34 = 78. Value requested: (3 * 23) = 69. I offered more value than requested, and they still rejected. This means they either didn't like the resource mix, or they just didn't need it.\n\nI have a decent amount of [Sheep] (14) and [Brick] (16). I also have 10 [Ore]. I'm a bit low on [Wood] (6) and [Wheat] (7).\n\nI should try to gain some [Wheat] or [Wood]. Or just get more [Ore].\nLet's try to get [Ore] again, as its value is high.\nI can offer some [Sheep] or [Brick].\n\nConsider this: Offer 3 Sheep (Value 51) for 1 Ore (Value 35). This is not good for value.\nOffer 2 Brick (Value 46) for 1 Ore (Value 35). Not good for value.\n\nI have a lot of [Sheep]. Maybe offer a large quantity of [Sheep] for something.\n\nLet's try to consolidate my value into higher-value goods, or resources that I am currently low on. [Wheat] is low in quantity.\n\nHow about offering some of my plentiful [Sheep] for [Wheat]?\n[Sheep] Value: 17. [Wheat] Value: 5.\nIf I offer 1 Sheep for 3 Wheat: Value (1 * 17) = 17 vs Value (3 * 5) = 15. This is good for me value-wise.\nI have a lot of [Sheep]. Player 1 might have some [Wheat].\n\nFinal Offer for this turn:\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 6 Wheat]",

      "response": "**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\n1. The initial focus is on maximizing the total value of resources after each trade. Player 0's recent offer (2 Sheep for 6 Wheat) looks tempting due to the potential higher value of Wheat. But I need to assess Player 1's current resources and values.\n   - Current total values before offer:\n     - Wheat: 13 x 5 = 65\n     - Wood: 8 x 11 = 88\n     - Sheep: 14 x 14 = 196\n     - Brick: 5 x 27 = 135\n     - Ore: 7 x 33 = 231\n     - Total = 705\n   - If accepted:\n     - New resources: 13 + 6 = 19 Wheat, 14 - 2 = 12 Sheep\n     - New value: Wheat = 95, Sheep = 168 (Total value = 778)\n   - The new total value increases, so I lean towards accepting this offer. \n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Strategist**\n1. Examining the resources, I believe maintaining a strong balance in diverse resources is crucial. Owning higher quantities of Wheat can benefit Player 1 in future trades as it may be a valuable resource. \n   - However, the resources exchanged by Player 0 lean towards a less optimal direction. I suspect that they are overvaluing Sheep. Therefore, the 2 Sheep for 6 Wheat trade could be beneficial in terms of future trading power.\n   - Decision point: Should I consider rejecting to try to extract a better deal?\n\n**Expert 3: The Conservative Trader**\n1. Having a strong position is essential, and Player 0's trade offers somewhat limited utility. Trading 2 Sheep\u2014a high-value resource for Player 1\u2014seems risky.\n   - While gaining Wheat is beneficial, it\u2019s vital to consider the volume of Wheat possessed already (13). Hence, losing 2 Sheep could slow down my future opportunities. \n   - My inclination is to deny this trade. Holding onto 12 Sheep preserves my high-value asset for the long term greedily. \n\n**Group Decision:**\nAfter discussing amongst ourselves:\n- Expert 1 has solid reasons to accept: gaining more Wheat does increase total value.\n- Expert 2 sees that prospective trades could yield higher value down the line.\n- Expert 3 establishes that maintaining a strong resource base is critical.\n\nUltimately, after deliberation, the experts respond with:  \n**[Deny]**",

I will analyze the value of my current resources and identify which resources give me the most 'bang for my buck' per unit. I currently have a good quantity of Sheep, Brick, and Ore, which are also my highest value resources. My Wood quantity is low after previous trades, and its value per unit is mid-range. Wheat has the lowest value per unit and I have a decent quantity.\n\n### **Expert 2: The \"Strategic Resource Balancer\"**\n\n**Step 1:** I need to consider not just value, but also the distribution of my resources. While I want to maximize overall value, I also need to ensure I don't become too reliant on one or two types of resources, or dump too much of a high-value resource without getting a comparable return. Looking at the history, I've been successful in acquiring Ore and Brick, which are good. I am low on Wood.\n\n### **Expert 3: The \"Market Opportunist\"**\n\n**Step 1:** I will look for opportunities to offload lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or to convert resources I have in surplus into resources I need. I've attempted to trade Sheep for Wheat in the last turn, which Player 1 rejected. This was a bad trade for me. I should be trading **out** of low-value Wheat and **into** high-value resources. However, I need to understand what Player 1 might be looking for. Player 1 offered Wood and Sheep for Brick previously, which suggests they might need Brick and have excess Wood/Sheep.\n\n---\n\n### **Expert 1: The \"Value Maximizer\"**\n\n**Step 2:** Given that my Wheat is the lowest value resource (5 per unit), I want to divest myself of it if possible, even for a relatively small gain. My Ore and Brick are the highest value resources. I should try to acquire more of these, or trade them only if the return is significantly higher. I'm low on Wood, which is also a mid-tier value resource, but given its scarcity in my inventory, I should be cautious about trading it away cheaply.\n\n### **Expert 2: The \"Strategic Resource Balancer\"**\n\n**Step 2:** I have a significant amount of Sheep and Brick, and a good amount of Ore. My Wood is now very low (6 units), and Wheat is also relatively low (7 units), but it's my lowest quality resource. I should prioritize getting more Wood if possible, as it's a versatile resource and I have very little. I can afford to trade some Sheep or Brick if the return is good, as I have a comfortable surplus of these high-value resources.\n\n### **Expert 3: The \"Market Opportunist\"**\n\n**Step 2:** Player 1 previously offered 4 Wood, 2 Sheep for 3 Brick. This tells me Player 1 values Brick. I rejected this offer (4*11 + 2*17 = 44+34 = 78 value offered by P1 for 3*23 = 69 value requested by P1). That was a decent offer, but I rejected it, likely as I had just acquired Brick. I could try to leverage their desire for Brick to get something valuable in return. Given my low Wood quantity, maybe I can trade some Brick for Wood, or for Ore, which is high value.\n\n---\n\n### **Expert 1: The \"Value Maximizer\"**\n\n**Step 3:** My previous attempt to trade Sheep for Wheat was a mistake - I was trading a higher value resource for a much lower one, even if I was trying to get rid of surplus. Instead, I should be looking to trade Wheat or other resources for higher value items like Ore or Brick. Since I have 7 Wheat and it's my lowest value resource, I should try to trade it away. What can I get for it? Player 1 has shown interest in Brick.\n\n### **Expert 2: The \"Strategic Resource Balancer\"**\n\n**Step 3:** My lowest quantity resource is Wood (6 units). My lowest value resource is Wheat (7 units). I have a decent quantity of Sheep (14) and Brick (16). I want to increase my Wood. Can I offer something Player 1 wants (like Brick, since they indicated interest) to get some Wood? Alternatively, I could try to trade some excess Sheep for Wood.\n\n### **Expert 3: The \"Market Opportunist\"**\n\n**Step 3:** Player 1 is looking for Brick. I have 16 Brick. I could offer some Brick in exchange for Wood, which I need. I could also try to get Ore from them if they have it, as Ore is my highest value resource. My last trade attempt (2 Sheep -> 6 Wheat) was poorly thought out, as I was trading valuable Sheep for low-value Wheat. I need to reverse that thinking. I should target trading Wheat or low quantities of Wood for higher value goods, or offering my surplus high-value goods (Sheep, Brick) for other high-value goods (Ore) or for resources I desperately need (Wood).\n\n---\n\nBased on the expert advice, my plan for this turn is to address my low Wood quantity and divest myself of low-value Wheat, while leveraging Player 1's apparent desire for Brick. I will attempt to trade some of my higher-value resources (Sheep or Brick) for Wood.\n\n### **Reasoning combines:**\n\n*   **Value Maximizer:** Focus on getting rid of low-value Wheat and acquiring high-value resources like Ore.\n*   **Strategic Resource Balancer:** My Wood quantity is critically low (6 units). This needs to be addressed. I have plenty of Sheep and Brick.\n*   **Market Opportunist:** Player 1 desires Brick. I can use this to my advantage to get Wood or even Ore. I also know that Player 1 offered Wood in their previous offer, suggesting they might have a surplus.\n\n**Action:** I will offer Player 1 some Brick, which they seemed to want, in exchange for Wood. This addresses my low Wood count and potentially helps Player 1, making the trade more likely to be accepted.\n\n**My final decision is to propose the following trade:** I have a good amount of Brick and Player 1 showed interest in it before. I am very low on Wood. I will offer a small amount of Brick to get a good amount of Wood. I'll make a slightly less aggressive offer than the last turn since Player 1 also rejected my previous offer.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 5 Wood]",

      "response": "### Expert Analysis for Trading Decision\n\n**Expert 1: Resource Optimization Specialist**\n- Focus: Maximizing the overall value of resources.\n- Current resources after trades: \n  - Wheat: 13, Wood: 1 (since 8 were used in trade), Sheep: 12, Brick: 7 (after trade), Ore: 9 (after trade).\n- Total Value Calculation: \n  - Wheat: 13 * 5 = 65\n  - Wood: 1 * 11 = 11\n  - Sheep: 12 * 14 = 168\n  - Brick: 7 * 27 = 189\n  - Ore: 9 * 33 = 297\n  - **Total Value: 65 + 11 + 168 + 189 + 297 = 730**\n\nThe current trades have optimized resources relative to their values. Monitoring Player 0's offers closely for potential future trades that can leverage excess resources will be key.\n\n**Next Step:** Consider trade offers that can increase the value of remaining resources.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: Strategic Negotiator**\n- Focus: Understanding player behavior and offers.\n- Player 0 currently offers 2 Brick for 5 Wood, which might seem unfavorable given the recent trades where Wood was depleted. \n- Player 0 seems eager to reduce their Wood for Brick, suggesting they need Wood for their next moves.\n\n**Next Step:** Propose an offer that plays on Player 0's current needs without giving away too much value. \n\n### Proposed Offer\n- **Offer:** [Offer: 3 Brick -> 5 Wood]\n\nThis offer provides value to Player 0 while enhancing my resource quantity (Wood) for future trades.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: Risk Management Advisor**\n- Focus: Analyzing risk in trades.\n- It's crucial to avoid overcommitting resources, especially since I still need a balanced portfolio of resources. If I trade away too many Sheep and Brick, I may face limitations in future offers.\n- Accepting Player 0's offer of 2 Brick for 5 Wood is risky since it trades essential resources for lesser value.\n\n**Next Step:** Maintain a conservative approach and refuse any dubious trades that may not align with increasing the overall resource value.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Action Steps:**\n1. **Accept** Player 0's offer only if it enhances my total resource value without compromising essential quantities.\n2. Consider the proposed offer aimed at acquiring more Wood. \n\nOverall, the consensus is to strategically monitor Player 0\u2019s needs to play towards optimizing total resources and values. Should additional offers arise, I will patiently assess rather than rush into trades that reduce overall value. \n\n**Next turn actions:** Depending on Player 0's next move, adapt the strategy accordingly, leaning towards maximizing resource values and rejecting unfavorable trades.",

      "response": "To analyze the current trading situation and make strategic decisions in the Negotiation Game, I will simulate three different trading experts with distinct perspectives: \n\n1. **The Resource Valuator** - Focuses on maximizing the overall value of resources.\n2. **The Market Analyst** - Considers market demand and potential future trades.\n3. **The Risk Taker** - Looks for high-reward trades, even if they seem risky.\n\n### Step 1: The Resource Valuator's Analysis\n\nThe current resources and their values are:\n- Wheat: 13 Qty, 5 Value\n- Wood: 8 Qty, 11 Value\n- Sheep: 14 Qty, 14 Value\n- Brick: 5 Qty, 27 Value\n- Ore: 7 Qty, 33 Value\n\nTotal current value = (13 * 5) + (8 * 11) + (14 * 14) + (5 * 27) + (7 * 33) = 65 + 88 + 196 + 135 + 231 = 715\n\nThe last trades involved Wood and Brick, which have good values. If we can trade excess resources for high-value resources, we can increase the total value.\n\n**Action:** [Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: The Market Analyst's Perspective\n\nLooking at the offers made, resources like Wood and Brick are what Player 0 seems to be interested in. Based on this, I will analyze the current market sentiment. If Player 0 is rejecting Sheep for Brick, it might indicate their lack of interest in Sheep. Instead, focusing on high-demand trades could be more beneficial.\n\nConsidering the value ratios:\n- Sheep to Brick is currently a 14:27 ratio.\n- Wood is being traded frequently, but it results in lower overall gain.\n\n**Action:** [Offer: 2 Ore -> 5 Wood]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: The Risk Taker's Proposition\n\nThere seems to be a hesitance around converting Sheep into much-needed Brick or Wood. I see an opportunity for a more opportunistic trade. If I manage to trade some low-value resources for higher returns later, that could be significant.\n\nSince Brick is a high-value resource, I can use some of my abundant resources that are less currently valued to try for a higher quantity of Brick.\n\n**Action:** [Offer: 10 Wheat -> 4 Brick]\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nEach expert has proposed trades that reflect their differing priorities. The expert perspectives allow for a well-rounded approach:\n1. The Resource Valuator focuses on balanced trades to enhance overall value.\n2. The Market Analyst advocates for leveraging market demands and known patterns.\n3. The Risk Taker looks for potentially high-yield, riskier resources.\n\nNext step: Based on the feedback from the simulated trades, Player 1 will decide on engagement and modify trade offers accordingly!",

My current total value is (7*5) + (19*11) + (14*17) + (13*23) + (8*35) = 35 + 209 + 238 + 299 + 280 = 1061.\nThe offer is to give away 4 Sheep (4 * 17 = 68) and 2 Wood (2 * 11 = 22), so I'm giving away 68 + 22 = 90 value. I would receive 3 Brick (3 * 23 = 69 value). This trade results in a net loss of 90 - 69 = 21 value. This is not value maximizing.\n\n### Expert 2: The Resource Manager\n**Thought:** I need to analyze the offer in terms of resource types. I would be giving away a fair amount of Sheep and Wood, which I have in good supply (14 Sheep, 19 Wood). I would receive Brick, which I also have in good supply (13 Brick). My goal is to increase total value, but also to diversify my resources effectively if a good opportunity arises. This offer doesn't seem to improve my resource distribution or scarcity in any meaningful way, as I'm trading common for common and taking a value hit.\n\n### Expert 3: The Market Analyst\n**Thought:** I need to consider the past trades and Player 1's previous offers and behavior. Player 0 previously offered 2 Sheep for 6 Wheat and 2 Brick for 5 Wood, both rejected by P1. P1 offered 4 Wood, 2 Sheep for 3 Brick, which P0 rejected because P0 wants to receive more value. It seems Player 1 is consistently trying to get Brick, and might be overvaluing them or trying to get them cheaply. This offer is similar to P1's earlier rejected offer, and it's still a bad deal for me in terms of value. I should continue to deny offers that are unfavorable.\n\n---\n### Expert 1: The Value Maximizer\n**Thought:** Since the proposed trade offers 69 value for 90 value, resulting in a net loss of 21 value, I should reject this offer. It directly contradicts my primary objective of increasing total value.\n\n### Expert 2: The Resource Manager\n**Thought:** From a resource management perspective, this trade is unfavorable. While I have plenty of Sheep and Wood, giving them up for Brick (which I also have plenty of) at a loss of value doesn't improve my overall resource position or create a more balanced portfolio. I should reject it and look for trades where I get more valuable resources or diversify effectively.\n\n### Expert 3: The Market Analyst\n**Thought:** Given Player 1's consistent attempts to acquire Brick at a disadvantageous exchange rate for me, and the clear negative value proposition of this current offer, I should reject it. Player 1 is not offering fair value from my perspective, and accepting this would set a bad precedent. I need to hold out for an offer that benefits me.\n\n---\n[Deny]",
