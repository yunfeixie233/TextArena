They will likely suggest trading lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or only making trades where they receive a significant net gain in value.\n*   **The Opportunist (Expert B)**: This expert constantly looks for quick, profitable trades, even if the individual gains are small. They are less attached to specific resources and more focused on the immediate value increase. They might spot good 1:1 or 2:1 opportunities.\n*   **The Strategic Investor (Expert C)**: This expert considers medium-to-long term goals. They might suggest building up certain resources if they unlock better future trading ratios or are part of a larger plan (even if the immediate value gain isn't huge). They'll also analyze the 'liquidity' of certain resources.\n\n---\n\n**Expert A (The Hoarder):** My primary goal is to increase my total resource value, and since I have a good amount of high-value resources like Brick and Ore, I should be very conservative about trading them away. My initial thought is to look for opportunities to offload some of my lower-value resources like Wheat and Wood, especially if I can get higher-value resources in return.\n\n**Expert B (The Opportunist):** I see we have a significant surplus of Wheat (21) and Brick (25). While Brick is valuable, having a very high quantity could make it a good candidate for trading, especially if another player has a scarcity and will pay a premium. My first thought is to explore offering some Wheat or Wood for resources like Ore or Sheep, or even Brick if the ratio is very favorable.\n\n**Expert C (The Strategic Investor):** Our most valuable resources per unit are Ore (36) and Brick (25). Wheat (5) and Wood (11) are our least valuable. We have a good quantity of all resources, with Wheat and Brick being the most abundant. My initial assessment is that we should aim to acquire more of the highest value resources (Ore, Brick, Sheep) by trading away our lower value resources (Wheat, Wood). We should also consider how liquid certain resources are \u2013 for example, many players might need Wheat or Wood.",

      "response": "[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 1: My role is to evaluate the current value of Player 1\u2019s portfolio and identify under/overvalued resources based on unit value.  \nCalculating total portfolio value:  \n- Wheat: 8 \u00d7 5 = 40  \n- Wood: 20 \u00d7 9 = 180  \n- Sheep: 9 \u00d7 13 = 117  \n- Brick: 5 \u00d7 29 = 145  \n- Ore: 9 \u00d7 32 = 288  \nTotal = 40 + 180 + 117 + 145 + 288 = **770**  \nOre has the highest unit value (32), followed by Brick (29). We have significant Ore and moderate Brick. We should aim to convert lower-value resources into higher-value ones, especially Brick or Ore.\n\n[Expert 2: Trade Flow Analyst]  \nStep 1: I analyze potential trade imbalances and liquidity. In such games, high-value items (like Ore and Brick) are often in demand for upgrades or constructions. However, having too much Ore (9 units) might indicate surplus if not being used.  \nWe have excess Wood (20) and Wheat (8), which are mid-to-low value. These are likely more tradable. Others may want Sheep (valuable at 13) or Brick/Ore. We can use our surplus low-value resources to trade up.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 1: I assess the likely mental models of opponents. Players tend to protect high-value resources (Ore, Brick) but may trade them if offered surplus lower-value goods they need. Offering some Sheep or Wood might entice them.  \nWe should appear generous but crafty\u2014offer more units of lower-value items to get fewer but higher-value returns. Avoid offering Ore or Brick unless getting significant value in return.\n\n---\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 2: To increase total value, we need to offload low-value-per-unit resources (Wheat, Wood) and acquire high-value ones (Brick, Ore).  \nOur highest unit-value resources are Ore (32) and Brick (29). We already have 9 Ore and 5 Brick\u2014so acquiring more Brick would be more impactful due to lower stock.  \nBest target: **Gain Brick** in exchange for **Wood or Wheat**.\n\n[Expert 2: Trade Flow Analyst]  \nStep 2: Observing typical trading patterns, players often accept 2\u20133 Wood or Wheat for 1 Brick due to its high value.  \nWe can propose: 4 Wood \u2192 1 Brick (fair), or 2 Wheat + 2 Wood \u2192 1 Brick (adding flexibility).  \nBut to make it appealing, maybe bundle: **5 Wood + 1 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick**? This gives a net gain: lose 5\u00d79 + 13 = 58, gain 2\u00d729 = 58 \u2192 break even in value, but increases high-value stock. Alternatively, slight premium to incentivize trade.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 2: A trade should *feel* beneficial to the other side. Offering 5 Wood (common surplus) and 1 Sheep (valuable but we have 9) for 2 Brick gives them a useful Sheep while we gain critical Brick.  \nThey may perceive Sheep as more useful (for trade or scoring), so they\u2019ll accept. The offer should be framed as generous on our part\u2014\u201cgiving up\u201d Sheep for \u201cjust\u201d 2 Brick.\n\n---\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 3: Final evaluation. Our current Brick count is low (5) relative to its value (29). Increasing Brick improves long-term value. Losing 5 Wood (from 20 to 15) is acceptable. Losing 1 Sheep (from 9 to 8) is minor.  \nNet effect:  \n- Lose: 5 Wood (45) + 1 Sheep (13) = 58  \n- Gain: 2 Brick (58) \u2192 value-neutral, but portfolio becomes more value-dense.  \nSince the goal is to *increase* total value, we might push for a slightly favorable trade: **5 Wood + 1 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick**? But that may be rejected.  \nBetter: **5 Wood \u2192 2 Brick**? That would be 45 out, 58 in \u2192 net +13. But is that too good to be true? Likely rejected.\n\nMost realistic favorable trade: **5 Wood + 2 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick**  \n- Cost: 5\u00d79 + 2\u00d713 = 45 + 26 = 71  \n- Gain: 3\u00d729 = 87 \u2192 Net +16  \nBut we may not need to go that far.\n\nBetter balance: **Offer: 5 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick**\n\nWait \u2014 is this the first move? Player 0 made no offer. We can act.\n\n[Expert 2: Trade Flow Analyst]  \nStep 3: Confirmed. The market-like behavior suggests 2:1 or 3:1 trades for Brick. We have surplus Wood.  \nA reasonable opening offer that may be accepted: **Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Brick**  \nBut that gives 45 value for 58 \u2014 opponent gains 13. Unlikely.  \nBetter: **Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Wheat** to balance perception? Too complex.\n\nSimple and tempting: **Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick**\n\nCost: 5\u00d79 + 2\u00d713 = 45 + 26 = 71  \nGain: 3\u00d729 = 87 \u2192 Net +16  \nThis significantly increases our total value.\n\nBut do we need to offer 2 Sheep? Maybe 1 Sheep is enough.\n\nCompromise: **Offer: 4 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick**\n\nCost: 36 + 13 = 49, Gain: 58 \u2192 Net +9  \nStill good. And we have plenty of Wood.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 3: After analysis, I recommend an offer that seems balanced but gives us an edge.  \nPropose: **5 Wood and 1 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick**  \nWe give multiple items (feels generous), but in reality, gain in value density.  \nOpponent gets a Sheep (valuable) and 5 Wood (useful), might accept.\n\nFinal consensus forming.\n\n\u2014\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 4: Approved. This trade increases our portfolio value from 770 to:  \n770 - (5\u00d79) - (1\u00d713) + (2\u00d729) = 770 - 45 -13 + 58 = **850** \u2192 Wait, no:  \nWait: 770 - 58 + 58? No: losing 5 Wood (45) and 1 Sheep (13) = 58  \nGaining 2 Brick = 58  \nSo new total: 770 - 58 + 58 = 770 \u2192 no change.  \nBut value concentration increases. However, goal is to *increase* total value.\n\nWe need a trade where we gain more value than we give.\n\nSo better: aim for **4 Wood + 1 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick** (cost 36+13=49, gain 58 \u2192 +9)  \nOr **5 Wood \u2192 2 Brick and 1 Wheat** (we give 45, gain 58+5=63 \u2192 +18) \u2014 but unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, can we *gain* Ore? Unlikely\u2014it's highest value.\n\nBest path: offer lower-value bundle that exceeds their perceived cost.\n\nAfter recalculating: **Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick, 2 Wheat**  \nLet me assess:\n\nLose: 3\u00d713=39, 2\u00d79=18 \u2192 57  \nGain: 2\u00d729=58, 2\u00d75=10 \u2192 68 \u2192 Net +11  \nAnd we get Wheat back \u2014 useful for later trades.\n\nBut complexity may reduce chance of acceptance.\n\nSimplest favorable: **5 Wood and 1 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick and 1 Wheat**  \nLose: 45+13=58  \nGain: 58+5=63 \u2192 Net +5\n\nStill gain.\n\nBut perhaps the cleanest profitable trade is:  \n**Offer: 4 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick**\n\nCost: 36+13=49  \nGain: 58 \u2192 Net +9\n\nYes.\n\n[Expert 2: Trade Flow Analyst]  \nStep 4: Confirmed. 4 Wood and 1 Sheep is a reasonable cost for 2 Brick.  \nWe have 20 Wood \u2192 16 left, 9 Sheep \u2192 8 left \u2014 sustainable.  \nThis improves our Brick stock from 5 to 7 \u2014 better for future trades or scoring.\n\n[Expert 3: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 4: Final note: the offer should not appear exploitative.  \n\"4 Wood and 1 Sheep for 2 Brick\" seems fair \u2014 they gain a Sheep (13) and 4 Wood (36) = 49, give 2 Brick (58). Wait \u2014 they lose value?\n\nNo: from their side, they give 2 Brick (58), receive 4 Wood (36) + 1 Sheep (13) = 49 \u2192 they lose 9 value.\n\nSo *they* are losing. That trade only works if they are desperate or miscalculate.\n\nAh! **Critical mistake.**\n\nWe must *offer* resources (left of ->) and *request* (right of ->)\n\nSo to gain 2 Brick, they must *give us* 2 Brick, we give them 4 Wood + 1 Sheep.\n\nSo from their view: they give up 2 Brick (58), get 4 Wood (36) and 1 Sheep (13) \u2192 net loss of 9.\n\nUnlikely to accept.\n\nWe must structure offer so *they* gain value, or at least perceive benefit.\n\nTherefore, reverse: to get 2 Brick, we may need to give more.\n\nExample: **Offer: 2 Brick -> 5 Wood, 2 Sheep**  \nBut that would lose us value \u2014 no.\n\nWe are Player 1. We want to **acquire** Brick.\n\nSo we must **offer** resources we have, **request** Brick.\n\nSo: [Offer: X -> Y] means we give X, receive Y.\n\nTo incentivize, Y must be of higher *perceived* value or we offer desirable surplus.\n\nBut mathematically, to *gain* value, value(offer) < value(request).\n\nSo if we offer 4 Wood + 1 Sheep = 36+13=49 \u2192 we must receive >49 in value.\n\n2 Brick = 58 \u2192 good.\n\nBut opponent must be willing.\n\nBut why would they give up 58 value for 49?\n\nOnly if they value the received goods more.\n\nSo perhaps they are rich in Brick, short on Sheep.\n\nWe don\u2019t know.\n\nBut as experts, we must try.\n\nAlternatively, aim for Ore? Too high value.\n\nOr trade down to upgrade? No.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps someone wants Wood badly.\n\nWe can offer a package that includes a high-quantity low-value item to entice.\n\nFinal recommendation: make an offer that is slightly favorable to them in quantity, but we gain in value.\n\nBut we don\u2019t gain unless value(request) > value(offer).\n\nBest bet: offer **5 Wood + 2 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick**\n\nWe give: 45 + 26 = 71  \nWe get: 87 \u2192 Net +16\n\nThey give: 87, get: 71 \u2192 they lose 16\n\nStill bad for them.\n\nImpossible to gain value in a rational trade.\n\nUnless the market has inefficiencies.\n\nBut in this game, trades likely break even or slight advantage.\n\nPerhaps the goal is to increase *strategic* value, not just arithmetic.\n\nBut instructions: \"increase total value\"\n\nSo unless we trade up in value, we won't increase.\n\nBut we can't do that unless opponent makes a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"value\" is not fixed? Or perhaps trades are with a system?\n\nNo, it's negotiation with Player 0.\n\nPlayer 0 made no offer.\n\nSo we must propose.\n\nBut any offer where we gain value means opponent loses \u2014 unlikely to accept.\n\nSo we need an offer where **value of what we give > value of what we get**, but we still come out ahead? No, that's loss.\n\nWait: no.\n\nIf we give resources worth 60, receive 50, we lose 10.\n\nTo gain, must give < receive.\n\nBut in voluntary trade, both gain \u2014 usually via differing valuations.\n\nBut in this game, values are fixed and shared.\n\nSo **no trade is mutually beneficial** unless it's to correct surplus/deficit for future gains.\n\nBut goal is to increase total value of our resources.\n\nSo only way is to execute a trade where the market value of what we receive exceeds what we give.\n\nBut if values are objective, only possible if opponent errors or we exploit.\n\nBut per game, we can try offers.\n\nBest chance: offer something that seems valuable but isn't.\n\nFor example, offer 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick? 25 for 29 \u2192 +4, but Wheat is 5\u00d75=25, Brick 29, they lose 4.\n\nBut we gain.\n\nBut 5 Wheat is a lot \u2014 might be tempting.\n\nWe have only 8 Wheat.\n\nOr 3 Sheep (39) \u2192 1 Ore (32)? They gain.\n\nNo.\n\nWe need to offer high-quantity mid-value for high-value low-quantity.\n\nBest: **Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep**\n\nCalculate:\nWe give: 3\u00d79=27, 2\u00d75=10 \u2192 37  \nWe get: 29 + 13 = 42 \u2192 Net +5\n\nThey give: 42 worth, get 37 \u2192 lose 5\n\nStill not rational.\n\nBut perhaps they want Wood.\n\nOr bundle: **Offer: 4 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 2 Brick**\n\nWe give: 36 + 15 = 51  \nWe get: 58 \u2192 +7\n\nBetter.\n\nWe have resources.\n\nAnd high quantity of Wood and Wheat.\n\nSo it's sustainable.\n\nPsychologically, offering 7 resources for 2 might feel generous.\n\nThey give away 2 Brick (58), get 4 Wood (36) and 3 Wheat (15) = 51 \u2014 still loss.\n\nBut maybe they need the Wood/Wheat.\n\nI think we have to try.\n\nAlternatively, accept that most trades will be value-neutral or slight gain, and aim for one with net +.\n\nAnother idea: maybe offer Brick or Ore ourselves to get more of the same? No.\n\nOr trade even to get a spread.\n\nBut goal is increase total value.\n\nSo only by receiving more value than giving.\n\nSo after analysis, I propose:\n\n**Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 2 Brick, 1 Sheep**\n\nWe give: 45 + 15 = 60  \nWe get: 58 + 13 = 71 \u2192 Net +11\n\nThey give: 71, get: 60 \u2014 lose 11. Unlikely.\n\nBut we get more Sheep back? We already have 9.\n\nNot necessary.\n\nBest compromise: **Offer: 6 Wood -> 2 Brick**\n\nWe give: 54, get: 58 \u2192 +4\n\nSmall gain.\n\nThey get 6 Wood (54), give 2 Brick (58) \u2014 lose 4.\n\nStill not good for them.\n\nConclusion: in a rational market with fixed values, no trade increases both parties' value.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to find a trade where the opponent values the received resources more, but here values are objective.\n\nSo perhaps the \"value\" is not for direct exchange, but for later use in scoring.\n\nOr the game expects us to make value-neutral trades to position for later.\n\nBut the goal is: \"total value of your resources increases\"\n\nSo must increase.\n\nOnly way is to receive high-value, give low-value.\n\nSo we must try offers that are slightly in our favor.\n\nFinal decision: make an offer that is attractive in quantity but has slight edge for us.\n\n**Offer: 5 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick**\n\nWe give: 45 + 5 = 50  \nWe receive: 58 \u2192 Net +8\n\nYes.\n\nWe have plenty Wood and Wheat.\n\nThis is acceptable.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "[Expert: Economist]  \nStep 1: My role is to maximize resource utility based on marginal value and scarcity. I begin by calculating the total current value of Player 1\u2019s holdings:  \n(8 \u00d7 5) + (20 \u00d7 9) + (9 \u00d7 13) + (5 \u00d7 29) + (9 \u00d7 32) =  \n40 + 180 + 117 + 145 + 288 = **770**  \nOur goal is to increase this total through trades. I will assess which resources we have in surplus relative to their value and identify potential gains from trade.\n\n---\n\n[Expert: Strategist]  \nStep 1: My focus is on long-term gain and positioning. I note that high-value resources like Ore (32) and Brick (29) are already well-held (9 and 5, respectively), while Wheat (value 5) is low-value but moderately abundant. Wood (9) is low-value per unit but in large quantity (20). Sheep (13) are mid-tier.  \nI suspect other players may be seeking Ore or Brick for late-game development, so we can leverage these for high-volume gains. We should avoid giving away Ore/Brick carelessly.\n\n---\n\n[Expert: Negotiator]  \nStep 2: I begin by analyzing trade dynamics \u2014 we need to create offers that appear fair or slightly favorable to the other party, while netting us a value gain. Since Player 0 made no offer, we must initiate.  \nWe should offload low-value/high-quantity resources (like Wood or Wheat) to acquire high-value ones (Ore, Brick). But we already have good Ore and Brick, so we may want to *trade out* some Ore to get even better deals? Wait \u2014 no higher-value resource exists.  \nAlternative: use Sheep and Wood to upgrade to Brick or Ore.\n\nNote: We must make the first move.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]  \nThis offer trades 5\u00d79 + 3\u00d713 = 45 + 39 = 84 value to gain 2\u00d729 + 1\u00d732 = 58 + 32 = 90 value \u2014 a net gain of +6. Marginally beneficial and may appeal to a player needing Wood/Sheep for settlements or development.\n\n[Expert: Economist]  \nStep 2: Recalculating:  \nCurrent value: 770  \nOffering: 5 Wood (45), 3 Sheep (39) \u2192 Total offered value: 84  \nRequesting: 2 Brick (58), 1 Ore (32) \u2192 Total requested: 90  \nNet value change if accepted: +6 \u2192 New total: 776  \nThis is a positive expected value trade. However, we must consider opportunity cost \u2014 are we depleting Sheep (9 \u2192 6), which may be needed for development cards? Wood is abundant (20 \u2192 15), so losing 5 is acceptable.  \nTrade is efficient. I remain.\n\n[Expert: Strategist]  \nStep 2: I evaluate the offer\u2019s strategic impact. We are rich in Wood and moderately in Sheep. Giving up 5 Wood and 3 Sheep is manageable. Gaining 2 Brick brings us to 7 Brick \u2014 possibly enough for multiple settlements or city walls. +1 Ore brings us to 10, a psychologically strong number.  \nHowever: do we *need* more Brick and Ore right now? We already have 5 Brick and 9 Ore \u2014 potentially enough for several builds. Is this trade hoarding unnecessarily?  \nBut the net value gain is positive, and Brick/Ore are the two most valuable resources. Accumulating them could give us leverage in future trades.  \nOffer is acceptable. I remain.  \n\n[Expert: Negotiator]  \nStep 2: I refine the offer strategy. The previous offer [5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore] has value, but perhaps we can do better by leveraging asymmetric demand.  \nMaybe another player is desperate for Sheep?

      "response": "[Expert: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 1: My focus is on maximizing total value by identifying under-valued and over-valued resources in my inventory based on unit value.  \n- Wheat: 8 \u00d7 5 = 40 (Low value)  \n- Wood: 20 \u00d7 9 = 180 (Low-Medium)  \n- Sheep: 9 \u00d7 13 = 117 (Medium)  \n- Brick: 5 \u00d7 29 = 145 (High)  \n- Ore: 9 \u00d7 32 = 288 (Very High)  \nTotal Current Value: 770  \nOre and Brick are the most valuable per unit. I should aim to *gain* more of these if possible, and trade away lower-value items like Wood or Wheat.\n\n[Expert: Trade Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 1: I analyze Player 0\u2019s behavior. They rejected an offer of 5 Wood and 3 Sheep for 2 Brick and 1 Ore.  \nThat offer gave them +5 Wood (valuable at 9) and +3 Sheep (13), costing them only 2 Brick (58) and 1 Ore (32) \u2014 net value gain for them would have been (5\u00d79 + 3\u00d713) = 45 + 39 = 84 vs cost of 58 + 32 = 90 \u2192 slight loss. But close.  \nThey may be risk-averse or value Brick/Ore highly. Likely unwilling to trade away high-value items without a strong gain. Need to make offers that appear favorable to them.\n\n[Expert: Supply & Demand Economist]  \nStep 1: I evaluate scarcity and relative supply.  \nMy Wood (20) and Wheat (8) are abundant. Sheep (9), Ore (9), Brick (5) are more limited.  \nIf Player 0 has low Brick/Ore, they won\u2019t trade them easily. Alternatively, if *I* have excess Sheep and Wood, I should use them as trade fuel.  \nSince my Brick is low (5), I should try to gain more. But Ore is high (9), so perhaps I can use excess Ore in trades if it increases total *value*.\n\n[Expert: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 2: Revising trade logic.  \nOffering 5 Wood (45 value) and 3 Sheep (39 total) = 84 value offered.  \nRequesting 2 Brick (58) and 1 Ore (32) = 90 value. That\u2019s a slight net gain for me (6), but a net *loss* for Player 0 \u2014 so rejection makes sense.  \nMy mistake: I framed an offer that benefits me slightly at their expense. Bad strategy. I should propose offers where they feel they\u2019re gaining or balancing.\n\n[Expert: Trade Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 2: Player 0 rejected an offer that was nearly fair but slightly favored me. They may only accept trades that are clearly beneficial to them or appear balanced with emotional appeal (e.g., rounding, familiar ratios).  \nI should consider structuring offers where they gain high-visibility items (like Wood, which is plentiful for me), and I request Brick or Ore in return, perhaps with a small *apparent* gain for them.\n\n[Expert: Supply & Demand Economist]  \nStep 2: Scarcity-wise, Brick has high value (29) and I only have 5 \u2014 that\u2019s below average if standard builds require more. Ore is high (32) and I have 9 \u2014 possibly surplus.  \nI could leverage excess Ore and abundant Wood to trade for Brick.  \nBut must balance: do not deplete Ore unless compensated with significant value.\n\n[Expert: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 3: Optimal trade: Offer resources with low marginal utility to me, request high marginal value.  \nI have 20 Wood \u2014 surplus. 9 Sheep \u2014 moderate.  \nBrick and Ore are highest value. I have less Brick (5) than Ore (9), so gaining Brick is higher priority.  \nBetter offer: Give 6 Wood (54) + 2 Sheep (26) = 80 value \u2192 Request 3 Brick (87).  \nThat\u2019s a net gain of 7 for me, and Player 0 gains 80 in lower-value goods \u2014 *feels* fair to them.\n\n[Expert: Trade Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 3: To increase acceptance, make the offer look balanced.  \nRequesting 3 Brick for 6 Wood and 2 Sheep seems plausible.  \nWood is universally needed early-game. 6 Wood is noticeable. 2 Sheep is minor.  \nFrom Player 0\u2019s view: \u201cI give 3 Brick (87 value) \u2192 get 6 Wood (54) + 2 Sheep (26) = 80\u201d. They might accept a small loss for liquidity or balance.\n\n[Expert: Supply & Demand Economist]  \nStep 3: Market equilibrium: Brick appears scarce (only 5 in my possession), so its market value may be higher than 29.  \nI can afford to pay ~80 value to get 3 Brick. Using Wood (plentiful) and Sheep (moderate) makes sense.  \nFinal consensus forming: Offer 6 Wood, 2 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick.\n\n[Expert: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 4: Final check.  \nAfter trade:  \n- Lose: 6 Wood \u2192 Wood: 14 left (still good)  \n- Lose: 2 Sheep \u2192 Sheep: 7 (still usable)  \n- Gain: 3 Brick \u2192 Brick: 8 (more flexible)  \nNew value: +87 -80 = +7.  \nAlso improves portfolio balance.\n\nDecision:\n\n[Offer: 6 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick]",

It is 6 Wood (value 66) and 2 Sheep (value 26) for my 3 Brick (value 75). At face value, I gain 92 - 75 = 17 in value. This is a positive net gain, and I should consider accepting it if I have an abundance of Brick.\n\n**Expert 2: The \"Resource Optimizer\"**\n*Step 1:* Evaluate the scarcity and value of each resource. Ore and Brick are my most valuable resources per unit. Sheep and Wood are mid-range, and Wheat is the lowest. I currently have a good quantity of Brick (25) and Wheat (21). Wood (18), Sheep (11), and Ore (12) are moderate to low. Giving away Brick, while I have many, means parting with a high-value resource. I need to ensure the incoming resources are more valuable to me, either intrinsically or for future trading.\n\n**Expert 3: The \"Long-Term Strategist\"**\n*Step 1:* Consider the overall goal: to increase the total value of my resources. This requires not just immediate gains, but also acquiring resources that are highly desired by others or are useful for completing valuable sets/combinations later. Brick is a high-value commodity. By trading it, I should aim for resources that are currently undervalued by Player 1 but highly valued by me (e.g., Ore if I want more of it), or resources that can be easily traded away for an even higher profit margin later.",

Risky.  \nBetter to offer only Wood (20 available) and Wheat (8) \u2014 my lowest-value surpluses \u2014 and request Brick or Ore.\n\n[Expert B: Trade Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 2: Noticing that two offers involved Sheep (which I have 9 of), but Player 0 consistently rejected.  \n\u2192 Sheep may not be desirable to Player 0 \u2014 either they have surplus, or their value perception differs.  \nAlternatively, my offers looked \"greedy\" \u2014 requesting more value than giving.  \nEven a small gap (80\u219287) may trigger rejection if perceived as unfair.  \n\u2192 Better: propose a trade that gives me slightly less gain but appears fair or even favorable to Player 0.\n\n[Expert C: Game Theory Tactician]  \nStep 2: Compute equilibrium approximation.  \nLet\u2019s assume rational players seek positive value change.  \nBest strategy: make an offer that gives Player 0 a small net gain while I also gain.  \nSuppose I offer: 7 Wood \u2192 1 Brick + 1 Sheep  \n- I give: 7\u00d79 = 63  \n- I get: 29 + 13 = 42 \u2192 I lose 21 \u2192 bad.  \nReverse: Offer 2 Wheat + 5 Wood \u2192 1 Brick  \n- I give: 2\u00d75 + 5\u00d79 = 10 + 45 = 55  \n- I get: 29 \u2192 I lose 26 \u2192 bad.  \nWait \u2014 Brick is 29, Ore is 32 \u2014 I must be careful.  \nBetter: I have Sheep valued at 13, but maybe they value it higher. Try trading excess Wood for Ore.  \nTry: 8 Wood + 1 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore  \n- I give: 8\u00d79 + 1\u00d75 = 72 + 5 = 77  \n- I get: 32 \u2192 I lose 45 \u2192 no.  \nAll these are bad.

I need to give less than 29 per Brick.  \nBut I must give *something* they want.  \nIdea: offer **Wheat + Wood**, low value to me, in high quantity, to get **1 Ore**.  \nBut Ore is 32 \u2014 to give 32, I need:  \ne.g., 3 Sheep = 39 \u2192 too much.  \nOr 3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore: 39 \u2192 32, I lose 7 \u2014 they gain 7.  \nBut I have 9 Sheep \u2014 is it worth losing 7 value to offload and simplify?  \nNot unless I get other benefits.  \n\n[Expert A: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 4: Recheck my goal: **increase total value of resources**.  \nCurrent total value:  \n- Wheat: 8\u00d75 = 40  \n- Wood: 20\u00d79 = 180  \n- Sheep: 9\u00d713 = 117  \n- Brick: 5\u00d729 = 145  \n- Ore: 9\u00d732 = 288  \nTotal: 40+180=220; 220+117=337; 337+145=482; 482+288= **770**  \nI need trades that increase this sum.  \nAny trade where value received > value given \u2192 positive.  \nSo I must offer bundles valued at, say, 60 to get >60.  \nBest opportunity: acquire more Brick (29) or Ore (32) by giving Wood (9) and/or Wheat (5).  \nBut no single resource trade works:  \n- 3 Wood = 27 \u2192 less than Brick (29) \u2192 could work if I add a tiny bit  \nBut: 3 Wood + 1 Wheat = 27+5=32 \u2192 could request 1 Brick (29) \u2192 I lose 3 \u2192 bad.  \nWait \u2014 if I **receive** 1 Ore (32), that\u2019s good.  \nSo: give 3 Wood + 1 Wheat = 32 \u2192 get 1 Ore: even \u2014 but no gain.  \nTo gain, I must get more than 32.  \nImpossible unless overpaying.  \nSo the only way is if **Player 0 values resources differently**.  \nBut game assumes common values?  \nRules don\u2019t specify \u2014 but values are given per player probably same.  \nSo rational: no trade unless value exchanged equal or favorable.  \nBut prior rejections suggest they're not accepting near-even or slight imbalance.  \n\n[Expert B: Trade Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 4: New insight: Perhaps Player 0 is **strategic** \u2014 they may have a high quantity of Brick and are waiting for an offer where they get *more* value.  \nMy first offer: gave them 5 Wood (45) + 3 Sheep (39) = 84 value, wanted 2 Brick (58) + 1 Ore (32) = 90 \u2192 I wanted 90 for 84 \u2014 net gain 6 for me, loss 6 for them.  \nThey rejected. Rational.  \nSecond: 6 Wood (54) + 2 Sheep (26) = 80 \u2192 wanted 3 Brick (87) \u2192 same issue: they would lose 7.  \nSo they rejected because **I asked for more than I gave**.  \n\u2192 Lesson: to get acceptance, I must give more value than I receive \u2014 or at least appear to.  \nBut then *I* lose. Contradicts goal.  \nUnless\u2026 I can get them to make the next offer.  \nBut if I keep proposing bad deals, they may never offer.  \n\n[Expert C: Game Theory Tactician]  \nStep 4: Realization: The only way to gain is to propose a trade where **I receive slightly less value**, but it helps rebalance my portfolio for future trades or goals.  \nBut goal is total value \u2014 so only value matters.  \nAlternatively: maybe **no good trade exists right now**.  \nBut I must act.  \nBest available: propose a **fair trade** (equal value) involving my surplus, to build momentum.  \nExample: 3 Sheep (39) \u2192 1 Ore (32) + 1 Wheat (5) + 2 Wood (18) \u2014 but that\u2019s giving 39, getting 55 \u2192 no, reversed.  \nWait: I want to **get** value.  \nLet\u2019s try: offer 8 Wood (72) \u2192 get 2 Brick (58) + 1 Sheep (13) + 1 Wheat (5) \u2014 I get 76, give 72 \u2192 net +4.  \nBut complex.  \nSimpler: Offer 4 Sheep (52) \u2192 get 1 Ore (32) + 1 Brick (29) = 61 \u2192 I gain 9. But I give only 52? No: 4\u00d713=52, get 61 \u2014 yes, +9.  \nBut is this possible? Do I have 4 Sheep? Yes (9).  \nBut what am I giving? 4 Sheep.  \nPlayer 0 would give me 1 Ore + 1 Brick.  \nBut Ore I already have 9 \u2014 is that useful? Yes, high value.  \nBut will Player 0 accept? They gain 52, I gain 61 \u2014 I get more. They lose 9. Unlikely.  \nReverse: what if I offer something big to get something smaller but useful?  \nNo.  \n\n[Expert A: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 5: Breakthrough \u2014 focus on **Wood**, which I have 20, value 9.  \nI can afford to trade at a slight loss to acquire scarce high-value items, *if* it unblocks future opportunity.  \nBut better: maybe **Brick is more valuable to me** due to scarcity (only 5), whereas I have 20 Wood.  \nSo even a neutral trade that converts excess Wood to scarce Brick may help.  \nBut only if I don't lose value.  \nTry: Find a trade where I give \u2264 X value and get > X.  \nBest imbalance opportunity: if I can trade **Wheat**, which is lowest value, in bulk for something better.  \nBut no resource is below 5.  \nSo no arbitrage.  \nUnless \u2014 maybe Player 0 needs Wheat for completion?  \n\n[Expert B: Trade Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 5: I propose a new tactic: make an offer that is **slightly favorable to Player 0** to increase acceptance chance, even if I break even or lose a little.  \nExample: Offer 3 Brick \u2192 5 Wood + 3 Sheep  \nBut I only have 5 Brick \u2014 giving 3 away? 3\u00d729=87  \nGet: 5\u00d79=45 + 3\u00d713=39 \u2192 84  \nI lose 3 \u2014 very slight.  \nBut I have Brick (5), not too scarce.  \nBut goal is to increase value \u2014 this decreases it.  \nNot optimal.  \n\n[Expert C: Game Theory Tactician]  \nStep 5: Final strategy: Since mutual gains are hard, switch to **inducement**.  \nMake an offer that Player 0 cannot rationally refuse \u2014 one where they gain significantly, and I gain slightly.  \nBut I have no high-value surplus to give.  \nUnless I offer part of my **Sheep or Wood** for **Ore**, at a rate they might accept.  \nTry: 4 Sheep + 2 Wood \u2192 2 Ore  \n- I give: 4\u00d713=52 + 2\u00d79=18 \u2192 70  \n- I get: 2\u00d732=64 \u2192 I lose 6 \u2192 bad.  \nReverse: 5 Wood + 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick + 1 Sheep  \n- I give: 45 + 10 = 55  \n- I get: 29 + 13 = 42 \u2192 lose 13 \u2192 no.  \nWait \u2014 I keep failing.  \nPerhaps the only viable path is to **accept future offers** only if they are positive.  \nBut I must make an offer.  \n\n**Consensus Decision**:  \nRevised offer: Focus on **high-volume low-value** to get **medium high-value**, with **small gain**.  \nTry: 7 Wood \u2192 2 Brick + 1 Wheat  \n- Give: 7\u00d79 = 63  \n- Get: 2\u00d729 = 58 + 5 = 63 \u2192 even  \nNo gain, but portfolio improves: I get more Brick (which is scarce), lose excess Wood.  \nBut no value gain.  \nAlternatively: 3 Sheep + 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick + 1 Wood (net: give 3S, 2W, get 2B)  \n- Give: 3\u00d713=39 + 2\u00d79=18 \u2192 57  \n- Get: 2\u00d729=58 \u2192 gain 1  \nYes!  \nNet: I give 3 Sheep, 2 Wood (keep 1 Wood given back), get 2 Brick.  \nEffective: 3 Sheep + 2 Wood \u2192 2 Brick  \nValue: give 39+18=57, get 58 \u2192 +1  \nMinimal gain, but positive.  \nAnd uses surplus Sheep and Wood.  \n\nBut earlier Sheep offers were rejected \u2014 risk.  \n\nAlternative: 8 Wood + 1 Wheat \u2192 3 Brick  \n- Give: 72 + 5 = 77  \n- Get: 87 \u2192 gain 10!  \nIs that right? 3\u00d729=87 yes.  \nGive 8\u00d79=72, 1\u00d75=5, total 77.  \nNet +10.  \nAnd only uses Wood and Wheat \u2014 low-value, high-surplus for me.  \nPlayer 0 gets 77 value, gives 87 \u2014 they lose 10.  \nUnlikely to accept.  \n\nSo scale down: 5 Wood + 2 Wheat \u2192 2 Brick  \n- Give: 45 + 10 = 55  \n- Get: 58 \u2192 gain 3  \nPlayer 0 gives 58, gets 55 \u2014 loses 3.  \nStill a loss for them.  \nBut small. Might accept if they want Wood/Wheat.  \n\nBut first offers with small loss were rejected.  \n\nNext best: propose a trade where **they gain a little**.  \nBut then I lose.  \n\nWait \u2014 **goal is to increase my value**, so I must receive > give.  \n\nTherefore, I must take risk.  \n\nFinal decision:  \n\n[Offer: 8 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 3 Brick]  \n\nThis gives me +10 value.  \nIt\u2019s my best shot.  \nIf Player 0 values Wood or Wheat highly (strategically), they might accept even at a small loss.  \nOr they may have surplus Brick.  \n\nProceed.  \n\n[Offer: 8 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 3 Brick]",

I need to analyze my current holdings to identify resources I can spare for a higher return. I have a lot of Brick and Wheat, but my Ore and Sheep quantities are relatively low given their high value. I should look to trade away lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or higher quantities of what I have in abundance for higher-value items.\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Balancer**\nI need to assess my resource distribution. While I have a lot of Brick and Wheat, I also want to ensure I don't become completely devoid of any specific resource. Having a good mix is important for future trading opportunities and potential building costs (though those aren't explicitly stated here, it's good practice). I have a high quantity of Brick (25) and Wheat (21). Ore (12) and Sheep (11) are relatively low. Wood (18) is moderate. I should prioritize obtaining more Ore and Sheep, or holding onto them if I can get a better deal for my excess lower-value resources.\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\nPlayer 1 has consistently offered Wood and Sheep for Brick and Ore. This indicates their needs. They seem to value Brick and Ore more than their own Wood and Sheep. However, their offers so far have been unfavorable to me. I need to counter their general interest in Brick/Ore but at a better rate, or identify what else they might be willing to pay a premium for. Since they've previously offered 6 Wood, 2 Sheep for 3 Brick (value 66+26=92 for 75), which I rejected, and then 8 Wood, 1 Wheat for 3 Brick (value 88+5=93 for 75), which I also rejected, they are consistently making offers where they gain value at my expense. I need to flip this dynamic.\n\n---\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nPlayer 1's previous offers were always negative value for me. I should either create an offer that is positive for me, or wait for Player 1 to make a better offer. Given Player 1's stated interest in Brick, and my high quantity of Brick, I could consider offering Brick for other higher-value resources I need, like Ore. However, Ore is also high value for me. Wood seems like a resource Player 1 is willing to part with. I have 18 Wood, Player 1 seems to have more or values it less. I have a lot of low-value Wheat (21). I could propose trading Wheat or Wood for resources like Ore or Sheep, or for a quantity of Brick that is more favorable to me.\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Balancer**\nMy goal is to acquire more Ore and Sheep to balance my portfolio, as these are high-value resources I have relatively less of. I have an abundance of Brick and Wheat. I could propose trading a favorable amount of Brick or Wheat for Ore or Sheep. Player 1 seems interested in Brick. However, giving up too much Brick, which is also high-value, without a significant return would not be ideal. I need to be careful not to deplete any one resource while acquiring another.\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\nPlayer 1 keeps trying to get Brick from me. This is useful information. Instead of waiting for their next bad offer, I should initiate an offer that takes advantage of their clear demand for Brick while ensuring I gain value. I have 25 Brick. I should formulate an offer that gives them Brick, but at a rate where I receive more value than I give, potentially asking for a combination of their plentiful Wood perhaps, and some of their Sheep or even Ore if they are desperate enough. I will propose an offer where I give a reasonable amount of Brick given my surplus and their demand, and request something valuable in return.\n\n---\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nPlayer 1 has shown a willingness to trade Wood and Sheep. My current Wood quantity is 18. If I can trade some of my excess Wood or Wheat for Ore (value 36) or even Sheep (value 13) at a good ratio, that would be a value gain. For example, trading 3 Wood (value 33) for 1 Ore (value 36) would be a net gain of 3. Or, 3 Wheat (value 15) for 1 Sheep (value 13) is a loss, so I need to be careful. I have a large quantity of Brick, but it's high value. I should look to leverage my excess of low-value Wheat. I will formulate an offer that uses my abundant Wheat for something I need.\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Balancer**\nI need to acquire more high-value resources like Ore and Sheep, while maintaining a good overall quantity of all resources. Player 1's consistent interest in Brick is notable, but I don't want to over-trade a high-value resource. I have a lot of Wheat (21). Perhaps I can trade some Wheat that Player 1 values for their Wood or Sheep, then use that to acquire Ore. However, a more direct trade might be best. I will consider offering a balanced amount of my excess Brick or Wheat for their Wood and Sheep, ensuring I am not over-committing to giving away my high-value Brick without a great return.\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\nPlayer 1 wants Brick. I have 25. They have consistently offered Wood and Sheep. I will exploit this. I'll propose a trade where I offer a moderate amount of Brick (e.g., 2 or 3) and request a significant amount of Wood as well as some Sheep or Ore, ensuring the value exchange is in my favor. I've rejected their offers where 3 Brick (value 75) was requested, and they offered items worth 93. This means they are willing to overpay for Brick. I will attempt to get a better value. For example, if I offer 3 Brick (75 value), I could ask for 8 Wood (88 value) and 1 Sheep (13 value). This would be a gain of 26 value for me.\n\n---\nI will follow the advice of Expert 3, modifying it slightly to secure a clear profit based on Player 1's demonstrated willingness to overpay for Brick. I observe that Player 1 offered 8 Wood (Value: 88) and 1 Wheat (Value: 5) for 3 Brick (Value: 75), meaning they were willing to give 93 value for my 75 value of Brick. This indicates a good opportunity to leverage my Brick. My previous rejection indicates I'm not desperate.\n\nI will offer 2 Brick (Value: 2 * 25 = 50) and request 6 Wood (Value: 6 * 11 = 66) and 1 Sheep (Value: 1 * 13 = 13).\nTotal value offered: 50. Total value requested: 66 + 13 = 79.\nThis represents a gain of 29 in value for me, while aligning with Player 1's observed need for Brick and their willingness to part with Wood and Sheep. This is a very favorable trade for me, offering a good profit.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 6 Wood, 1 Sheep]",

So [Deny].\n\n[Expert C - Step 2]:  \nRe-evaluating surplus:  \n- Wood: 20 \u2192 still high, can be used as trade fuel  \n- Wheat: 8 \u2192 lowest value, should be used in combos  \n- Sheep: 9 \u2192 moderate value, but not core  \nBest path: **Bundle low + medium value to get high-value Ore or Brick**.  \n\nCurrent offers failed because they gave too much medium-value (Wood/Sheep) for Brick.  \nAlternative: **Offer Wheat + Wood to reduce overhead**.  \n\nPlayer 0 might accept **8 Wheat + 4 Wood \u2192 2 Brick**?  \nBut we offered **8 Wood + 1 Wheat \u2192 3 Brick** earlier \u2014 overpaid.  \n\nRevised strategy: **Request only Ore**, or **use Wheat in creative bundles**.\n\n---\n\n[Expert A - Step 3]:  \nPlayer 1 needs to target **Ore** (value 32) \u2014 highest-value item.  \nWe have 9 Ore, but if Player 0 needs Ore, we could trade low-value items to gain more.  \nBut we don\u2019t know Player 0\u2019s holdings.  \n\nAlternative: **Brick (29)** is next best. But Player 0 is stingy on Brick.  \nWait \u2014 Player 0 **has at least 2 Brick** to offer. Possibly more.  \nBut they want **6 Wood + 1 Sheep** (67 value) for **2 Brick** (58) \u2014 bad for us.  \n\nSo **do not accept**.\n\n[Expert B - Step 3]:  \nPlayer 0\u2019s behavior suggests they are **defensive with Brick**, possibly hoarding.  \nThey may be willing to **trade Ore** if needed.  \n\nWe haven\u2019t tested that.  \nBest next move: **make a new offer targeting Ore**, using low-impact resources.  \n\nTry: **5 Wood + 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore**  \nValue out: 45 + 10 = 55  \nValue in: 32 \u2192 still a loss? No, unless we're getting value elsewhere.  \nWait \u2014 that\u2019s unprofitable.\n\nReverse: Can we **offer a small amount of high-value to get multiple medium?**  \nBut risky.\n\nBetter: **Offer 3 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 1 Brick**  \nValue out: 15 + 27 = 42  \nValue in: 29 \u2192 slight loss, but clears surplus? Not ideal.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps we\u2019re undervaluing **strategic accumulation**. We need to **increase total value**, not just trade even.\n\n[Expert C - Step 3]:  \nOptimal trade must yield **net positive value**.  \nLet\u2019s reverse-engineer:  \nTo gain 1 Ore (32), we should offer \u226432 in value.  \nBest to offer from **low-value-density resources**: Wheat (5), Wood (9).  \n\nExample: **3 Wheat (15) + 2 Wood (18) = 33 \u2192 for 1 Ore (32)** \u2192 almost neutral.  \nBut 33 > 32, so still losing 1 value.\n\nBetter: **2 Wheat + 2 Wood = 10 + 18 = 28 \u2192 for 1 Ore (32)** \u2192 +4 value. **Good**.  \nCan we push that?\n\nBut Player 0 may not want Wheat. Still, worth testing.\n\nAlternatively: **Trade up from surplus**.\n\nWait \u2014 **Player 1 has 8 Wheat**, value 5: lowest.  \n**Best to use Wheat as trade bait**, even if inefficient.\n\nNew idea: **Offer 5 Wheat + 1 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick**  \nOut: 25 + 13 = 38  \nIn: 58 \u2192 **+20 value!**  \nBut will Player 0 want 5 Wheat and 1 Sheep? Unlikely \u2014 but possible if they are building settlements.\n\nAlternatively: **Offer 4 Wood + 1 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick**  \nOut: 36 + 5 = 41 \u2192 In: 29 \u2192 loss of 12 \u2192 bad.\n\nNo \u2014 need to **request more than we give**.\n\nWait \u2014 reverse: **Can we get 1 Brick for \u226429 in value offered?**  \nYes \u2014 if we offer **3 Wood (27)** \u2192 almost enough.  \nBut 3 Wood for 1 Brick = +2 value \u2014 good.  \nBut Player 0 may not accept.\n\nGiven Player 0 rejected multiple Wood+Sheep offers, perhaps they **only trade Brick when getting many resources**.\n\nBut their counteroffer shows they want **6 Wood + 1 Sheep** for 2 Brick \u2014 i.e., **3.5 resources per Brick**.\n\nSo they may want **bulk**.\n\nSo to get 1 Brick, offer **3 Wood + 1 Sheep** = 27 + 13 = 40 \u2192 for 1 Brick (29) \u2192 still losing.  \nNot good.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps **we should stop pursuing Brick**.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate: **Ore is worth more (32)** and we have 9.  \nIf we **trade for Ore**, better opportunity.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know if Player 0 has Ore.\n\nBest move: **Probe with a profitable offer**.\n\nBut no incoming offer to accept.\n\nWe must make one.\n\nFinal plan: Create an offer that is **attractive to Player 0** but **net positive or neutral for us**, using surplus.\n\nTry: **Offer 5 Wood + 2 Wheat \u2192 Request 1 Ore**  \nOut: 45 + 10 = 55 \u2192 In: 32 \u2192 **-23 value** \u2192 no.\n\nToo much.\n\nLower: **Offer 2 Wood + 2 Wheat \u2192 Request 1 Brick**  \nOut: 18 + 10 = 28 \u2192 In: 29 \u2192 **+1 value**! \u2705  \nThis is **value-positive**.\n\nAnd uses surplus: Wood and Wheat.\n\nPlayer 0 gets 2 resources \u2014 small, but if they need Wood/Wheat, possible.\n\nBut previous patterns show they want larger bundles.\n\nTry: **3 Wood + 3 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick**  \nOut: 27 + 15 = 42 \u2192 In: 29 \u2192 -13 \u2192 bad.\n\nStick to **2 Wood + 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick**.\n\nBut might be too small.\n\nAlternative: **3 Wood + 1 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore**  \nOut: 27 + 5 = 32 \u2192 In: 32 \u2192 neutral.  \nAcceptable if it moves resources.\n\nBut we want **increase**.\n\nWait \u2014 we have Sheep at 13. Can we combine?\n\n**2 Sheep (26) \u2192 1 Brick (29)** \u2192 **+3 value**! \u2705  \nOr **2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore (32)** \u2192 **+6 value**! \u2705\u2705\u2705  \nExtremely good \u2014 but will Player 0 want 2 Sheep?\n\nThey previously wanted **Wood + Sheep**, so possibly.\n\nBut they rejected **3 Sheep** earlier?  \nYes \u2014 in Player 1\u2019s first offer: 5 Wood + 3 Sheep \u2192 only 2 Brick + 1 Ore  \nValue out: 45 + 39 = 84 \u2192 In: 58 + 32 = 90 \u2192 actually **+6**, but rejected.\n\nWait \u2014 that was a good offer.\n\nBut Player 0 rejected \u2014 maybe not wanting to lose Brick.\n\nSo perhaps **they won\u2019t give high-value for Sheep**.\n\nAlternate: **Use Wheat + Wood to get Ore** in bulk.\n\nBut hard.\n\nBest immediate move: **Since Player 0 offered 2 Brick for 6 Wood + 1 Sheep, which is value-negative, we [Deny] that**.\n\nThen make a new offer.\n\n[Expert A, B, C all agree: no valid reason to accept current offer.]\n\n[Deny]  \nThen make new offer: **2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore** \u2014 highly profitable if accepted.\n\nBut may be rejected.\n\nAlternatively: **4 Wood \u2192 1 Brick** \u2192 Out: 36, In: 29 \u2192 loss.\n\nNo.\n\nWait \u2014 **3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore** \u2192 27 \u2192 32 = +5. Good.\n\nOr **1 Sheep + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore** \u2192 13 + 9 = 22 \u2192 32 = +10! Excellent.\n\nYes.\n\nBest offer: **1 Sheep + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore**\n\nHigh value gain, uses surplus.\n\nEven if rejected, no harm.\n\nAlso, smaller bundle may be more palatable.\n\nBut Player 0 may want larger trades.\n\nWe can try.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[Deny]  \nThen: [Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

This trade is beneficial in terms of raw value.\n\n**Expert 2 (Resource Optimizer) - Step 1:**\nAnalyze the resource types involved.\n*   We'd be giving up 2 Brick (medium-high value, good quantity) and 1 Ore (very high value, good quantity).\n*   We'd be gaining 5 Wood (medium value, good quantity) and 3 Sheep (medium-high value, moderate quantity).\n*   Giving up high-value Ore, even for a slight value gain, might not be optimal for long-term portfolio quality unless we have an excess. We have 12 Ore, which is not an extreme excess, and 25 Brick which is quite high.\n\n**Expert 3 (Opportunistic Trader) - Step 1:**\nObserve Player 1's request.\n*   Player 1 wants Brick and Ore. These are high-value resources. This indicates Player 1 might be willing to pay a premium for them.\n*   The offer is 5 Wood, 3 Sheep for 2 Brick, 1 Ore. The quantity of Wood and Sheep offered suggests Player 1 has an abundance of them or values them less than we do.\n\n---\n\n**Player 0's decision for the previous offer (already rejected):**\nThe offer (5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore) was rejected.\n\n---\n\n**Turn 2 (P0):**\nPlayer 0 made no new trade offer.\nPlayer 1 rejected the trade offer. // (This refers to P0's implied nothing offer, or a previous one)\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1 (Value Maximizer) - Step 2:**\nRecalculate current total value and consider if making an offer is worthwhile. If no offer is made by us, then there's no direct value calculation for this turn. Always be ready to identify profitable trades.\n\n**Expert 2 (Resource Optimizer) - Step 2:**\nOur resource quantities are high (Wheat: 21, Wood: 18, Brick: 25). Ore is also good at 12. Sheep is moderate at 11. We have a good quantity of everything for now. Holding high-value resources like Ore and Brick is generally good. Perhaps we should look to shed some Brick or Wood for Ore or Sheep if the value exchange is decent.\n\n**Expert 3 (Opportunistic Trader) - Step 2:**\nPlayer 1 rejected our non-offer (or perhaps rejected the implicit refusal to trade according to the game flow). They are clearly looking for Brick and Ore. We have 25 Brick and 12 Ore. We have a lot of Brick. We can consider leveraging our high Brick quantity in future offers to get high-value resources we might need or to get a significant value gain.\n\n---\n\n**Turn 3 (P0):**\nPlayer 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 6 Wood, 2 Sheep -> Requested items: 3 Brick\nPlayer 0 rejected the trade offer.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1 (Value Maximizer) - Step 3:**\nEvaluate the direct value change of the new proposed trade (6 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick).\n*   Offered: 6 Wood (6 * 11 = 66) + 2 Sheep (2 * 13 = 26) = 92\n*   Requested: 3 Brick (3 * 25 = 75) = 75\n*   Value Change: 92 - 75 = +17. This is a good value gain. We gain 17 value.\n\n**Expert 2 (Resource Optimizer) - Step 3:**\nAnalyze the resource types for the new offer.\n*   We'd be giving up 3 Brick. We have 25 Brick, so this is a large quantity that we can afford to part with. Brick is a high-value resource.\n*   We'd be gaining 6 Wood and 2 Sheep. Wood is medium value, Sheep is medium-high.\n*   This trade helps us reduce a highly abundant, high-value resource (Brick) for more diverse, medium-value resources. It effectively converts a concentrated asset into a diversified one, while also being value-positive.\n\n**Expert 3 (Opportunistic Trader) - Step 3:**\nObserve Player 1's consistent request for Brick.\n*   Player 1 is still targeting Brick. This reinforces the idea that Player 1 values Brick highly or has a strong need for it.\n*   The offer of 6 Wood and 2 Sheep for 3 Brick is more favorable than their previous offer (which included Ore) even if the net value gain is better. It seems they are getting more desperate for Brick specifically. We have a lot of Brick. This could be a good trade to consider making ourselves, if not accepting this one.\n\n---\n\n**Player 0's decision for the previous offer (already rejected):**\nThe offer (6 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick) was rejected.\n\n---\n\n**Turn 4 (P0):**\nPlayer 0 made no new trade offer.\nPlayer 1 rejected the trade offer. // (Again, implies P0's implicit non-offer was rejected)\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1 (Value Maximizer) - Step 4:**\nSince no offer was made by us, there is no value calculation. Still, we should actively seek trades that yield positive value. The previous trade for +17 value was a good opportunity. We should aim for similar or better.\n\n**Expert 2 (Resource Optimizer) - Step 4:**\nWe still have a good quantity of all resources. Our Brick count (25) remains very high. Liquidating some Brick for other resources, especially if it brings in high-value ones or improves our overall resource spread, is a viable strategy. We should consider initiating a trade.\n\n**Expert 3 (Opportunistic Trader) - Step 4:**\nPlayer 1's continued rejection of our lack of offers or their frustration suggests they are still actively seeking trades. Their consistent attempts to acquire Brick indicate a consistent demand. We should prepare an offer leveraging our abundant Brick. Their previous offer of 6 Wood, 2 Sheep for 3 Brick was quite good (for us).\n\n---\n\n**Turn 5 (P0):**\nPlayer 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 8 Wood, 1 Wheat -> Requested items: 3 Brick\nPlayer 0 rejected the trade offer.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1 (Value Maximizer) - Step 5:**\nEvaluate the direct value change of the new proposed trade (8 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 3 Brick).\n*   Offered: 8 Wood (8 * 11 = 88) + 1 Wheat (1 * 5 = 5) = 93\n*   Requested: 3 Brick (3 * 25 = 75) = 75\n*   Value Change: 93 - 75 = +18. This is an even better value gain than the last one (+17). It's a very good trade in terms of raw value.\n\n**Expert 2 (Resource Optimizer) - Step 5:**\nAnalyze the resource types for the new offer.\n*   We'd be giving up 3 Brick (out of 25), which is fine given our abundance.\n*   We'd be gaining 8 Wood (medium value, good quantity) and 1 Wheat (low value, most abundant resource for us).\n*   This trade still helps us shed Brick at a good exchange rate, diversifying our medium/low-value resources (Wood, Wheat). Considering we have 21 Wheat and 18 Wood, adding more is not bad, and shedding Brick is good. This aligns with optimizing our resource distribution by trading a concentrated high-value resource for more diversified lower-to-medium-value ones, and the value gain is great.\n\n**Expert 3 (Opportunistic Trader) - Step 5:**\nObserve Player 1's increasing desperation for Brick.\n*   Player 1 is still focused on acquiring Brick. The offer's value has increased again (8 Wood, 1 Wheat for 3 Brick vs. 6 Wood, 2 Sheep for 3 Brick). This confirms their high need for Brick. They are offering more to get it. This is a very strong signal. We should definitely be engaging on Brick. This is a highly favorable trade for us.\n\n---\n\n**Player 0's decision for the previous offer (already rejected):**\nThe offer (8 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 3 Brick) was rejected.\n\n---\n\n**Turn 6 (P0):**\nPlayer 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 2 Brick -> Requested items: 6 Wood, 1 Sheep\nPlayer 1 rejected the trade offer.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1 (Value Maximizer) - Step 6:**\nEvaluate Player 0's initiated offer (2 Brick -> 6 Wood, 1 Sheep).\n*   Offered: 2 Brick (2 * 25 = 50) = 50\n*   Requested: 6 Wood (6 * 11 = 66) + 1 Sheep (1 * 13 = 13) = 79\n*   Value Change: 79 - 50 = +29. This is an EXCELLENT value gain. We are getting 29 value from this trade. It's significantly better than any offer Player 1 has made to us so far.\n\n**Expert 2 (Resource Optimizer) - Step 6:**\nConsider the initiated trade (2 Brick -> 6 Wood, 1 Sheep).\n*   We are giving up 2 Brick, still a good amount to shed from our large reserve.\n*   We are gaining 6 Wood and 1 Sheep, which helps diversify our portfolio and increase our overall quantities of those resources.\n*   This trade successfully sheds high-value Brick for other resources at a very favorable exchange rate. This is optimal for resource optimization and value.\n\n**Expert 3 (Opportunistic Trader) - Step 6:**\nAnalyze Player 0's initiated offer in context of Player 1's behavior.\n*   We offered 2 Brick for 6 Wood and 1 Sheep. Player 1 has consistently tried to get Brick from us, but this offer wasn't accepted.\n*   Compare to Player 1's best recent offer (8 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 3 Brick), which was 93 value for 75 value (-18 for P1, +18 for P0).\n*   Our offer: 50 value for 79 value (-29 for P1, +29 for P0). Player 1 likely rejected this because the profit margin for us was too high, making it too unfavorable for P1. We were perhaps too greedy, even if Player 1 is desperate for Brick. This suggests that while Player 1 wants Brick, they are not willing to take *any* deal. We need to find a sweet spot that is beneficial to us but not devastating to them.\n\n---\n\n**Player 0's decision (made an offer):**\nOffered items: 2 Brick -> Requested items: 6 Wood, 1 Sheep\nPlayer 1 rejected the trade offer.\n\n---\n\n**Turn 7 (P0):**\nPlayer 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1 (Value Maximizer) - Step 7:**\nEvaluate Player 1's new offer (1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore).\n*   Offered: 1 Sheep (1 * 13 = 13) + 1 Wood (1 * 11 = 11) = 24\n*   Requested: 1 Ore (1 * 36 = 36) = 36\n*   Value Change: 24 - 36 = -12. This trade would result in a **loss of 12 value**. This is a bad trade in terms of raw value.\n\n**Expert 2 (Resource Optimizer) - Step 7:**\nAnalyze the resource types for the new offer.\n*   We'd be giving up 1 Ore (highest value resource, 12 units). We have a decent quantity, but it's our most valuable.\n*   We'd be gaining 1 Sheep (medium-high value, 11 units) and 1 Wood (medium value, 18 units).\n*   This trade means giving up our most valuable resource for lower-value ones, and at a value loss. This goes against the principle of acquiring high-value resources and divesting low-value ones, unless we have an extreme excess of Ore, which we don't. This would be a poor resource optimization.\n\n**Expert 3 (Opportunistic Trader) - Step 7:**\nObserve Player 1's new demand.\n*   Player 1 is now targeting Ore. This indicates a shift in their needs or strategy, possibly having secured enough Brick from elsewhere or being unable to get it from us at a reasonable price for them.\n*   The offer of 1 Sheep, 1 Wood for 1 Ore is highly unfavorable to us in terms of value. Player 1 is trying to get our high-value Ore for cheap. This indicates they *really* want Ore, but are trying to low-ball us. We should absolutely not accept this. We should perhaps counter if we want to give up Ore, but only for a much better deal.\n\n**Player 0's Action:**\nThe offer from Player 1 is 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore.\nBased on **Expert 1**, this is a direct value loss of 12.\nBased on **Expert 2**, this means trading our highest value resource for lower value ones at a loss.\nBased on **Expert 3**, this is a low-ball offer for a resource Player 1 clearly wants.\n\nAll experts agree this is a bad offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"Deny\", \"comment\": \"The offer would lead to a significant value loss for Player 0, converting a high-value resource (Ore) into lower-value ones (Sheep, Wood) at an unfavorable rate.\"}\n```",

      "response": "[Expert A: Resource Valuation Specialist]  \nStep 1: I analyze the intrinsic value of each resource based on current holdings and marginal utility. My goal is to identify which resources are overabundant or scarce relative to their value.  \nWheat: 8 units \u00d7 5 = 40  \nWood: 20 units \u00d7 9 = 180 \u2192 high quantity, medium value \u2192 likely overstocked  \nSheep: 9 units \u00d7 13 = 117 \u2192 moderate stock, rising value \u2192 potential surplus if not needed  \nBrick: 5 units \u00d7 29 = 145 \u2192 low quantity, high value \u2192 scarcity increases worth  \nOre: 9 units \u00d7 32 = 288 \u2192 high value, but only 9 units \u2192 very valuable, likely needed  \n\nConclusion: Wood is our most abundant and relatively lower-value resource. Trading excess Wood for higher-value Brick or Ore would increase total portfolio value.\n\n---\n\n[Expert B: Strategic Negotiation Analyst]  \nStep 1: I evaluate recent trade dynamics and counterparty behavior. Player 0 has consistently rejected offers involving Wood and Sheep, but *did offer* 2 Brick for 6 Wood and 1 Sheep \u2014 suggesting they value Wood highly.  \nThis reveals:  \n- Player 0 may be Wood-deficient or Brick-rich.  \n- They are willing to trade high-value Brick for mid-tier Wood, which is exploitable.  \n- Their rejection of previous offers with 5\u20138 Wood suggests they want larger bundles or better terms.  \n\nTrend: Player 0 seems to prefer lopsided trades in their favor. We should leverage their Wood demand with a precise, minimally generous offer.\n\n---\n\n[Expert C: Opportunity Cost Economist]  \nStep 1: I calculate the opportunity cost of holding each resource versus potential gains from trade.  \nCurrent total value:  \n(8\u00d75) + (20\u00d79) + (9\u00d713) + (5\u00d729) + (9\u00d732) = 40 + 180 + 117 + 145 + 288 = **770**\n\nIf we trade 6 Wood (value 54) and 1 Sheep (13) \u2192 total cost: 67  \nIn return, getting 2 Brick (2\u00d729 = 58) and possibly more \u2014 but net loss unless compensated with Ore or surplus Brick.  \n\nBut Player 0\u2019s offer of 2 Brick for 6 Wood + 1 Sheep implies *they* see surplus in Brick. If we can flip this: offer slightly less attractive package but still tempting, and gain high-value resources.\n\nWait \u2014 their offer was *to us*, meaning they want Wood. So we can *demand more*.\n\n[Expert C revises]: Actually, their offer gives us 2 Brick for 6 Wood + 1 Sheep \u2014 brick at 29 each is worth more than wood (9) and sheep (13). Let's compute:  \nWe give: 6\u00d79 = 54, 1\u00d713 = 13 \u2192 67 total value  \nWe get: 2\u00d729 = 58 \u2192 net loss of 9? That seems bad\u2026\n\nBut wait \u2014 unless Player 0 has distorted valuations. Maybe they *really* need Wood. Then we can extract *more* than 2 Brick.\n\n[Expert C continues]: So instead of accepting that, we should reverse and *demand* better: trade smaller amounts of Wood for higher-value returns like Ore.\n\n---\n\n[Expert A: Resource Valuation Specialist]  \nStep 2: Refining priorities \u2014 Wood is clearly our highest surplus: 20 units is very high, especially with only 9 value per unit. Sheep at 13 is decent, but we have 9 \u2014 potentially reducible. Brick and Ore are both high-value and low-supply.  \nBest trade direction: **Wood \u2192 Brick or Ore**  \nEven better: **Wood + minimal Sheep \u2192 Ore**, since Ore is most valuable.  \n\nI suggest targeting Ore directly now.\n\n---\n\n[Expert B: Strategic Negotiation Analyst]  \nStep 2: Player 0 rejected three offers from us that were 5\u20138 Wood + Sheep for Brick. But they *initiated* a counter-offer wanting 6 Wood + 1 Sheep for 2 Brick. This signals:  \n- They are not willing to give up Brick easily.  \n- They are aggressive buyers of Wood.  \nSo if they are willing to *pay* 2 Brick for 6 Wood + Sheep, then perhaps they would pay *Ore* for Wood if we ask.\n\nOur last offer of 1 Sheep + 1 Wood for 1 Ore was too aggressive \u2014 they may not want to give up high-value Ore so cheap. We need to attach *more* value to make them think it's fair \u2014 but still net positive for us.\n\nIdea: Offer a bundle that looks generous but centers on dumping Wood for Ore.\n\n---\n\n[Expert C: Opportunity Cost Economist]  \nStep 2: Recalculating \u2014 holding Wood costs us **trading optionality**. We can't increase total value without upgrading to Brick/Ore.  \nEven a 1:1 exchange of Wood value \u2192 Ore value isn't direct (9 vs 32), so we need ratio leverage.\n\nBest possible: Trade 3 Wood (27) + 1 Sheep (13) = 40 total value \u2192 request 1 Ore (32). That\u2019s slightly in their favor, but we accept because we value optionality.  \nBut Player 0 may reject \u2014 they might want bigger bundles.\n\nAlternative: Offer 9 Wood (81) + 1 Wheat (5) = 86 value \u2192 demand 3 Brick (87) \u2192 slightly favorable to us. But previous similar offer was rejected.\n\nWait \u2014 Player 0 offered *us* 2 Brick for less. So they must want Wood *urgently*. We can now *demand* Ore.\n\nFinal insight: **Make an offer that uses high quantity of Wood to extract 1 Ore \u2014 a top-value resource \u2014 at acceptable cost.**\n\n---\n\n[Expert A: Resource Valuation Specialist]  \nStep 3: Optimal trade: **Sacrifice excess Wood and minor Wheat/Sheep to gain Ore.**  \nWe have 20 Wood \u2014 lose up to 9.  \nWe have 8 Wheat \u2014 lose 1\u20132.  \nWe have 9 Sheep \u2014 lose 1\u20132.  \nTarget: **1 Ore (value 32)** in return.\n\nMinimum fair offer from our side: 6 Wood (54) + 1 Sheep (13) = 67 \u2192 fair to ask for 2 Brick (58) or 1 Ore (32).  \nBut 1 Ore is better \u2014 higher value, lower quantity.\n\nBut Player 0 may undervalue Ore or hoard it.\n\nAlternative: Use 9 Wood + 1 Sheep \u2192 ask for 1 Ore. High Wood volume may appeal.\n\n---\n\n[Expert B: Strategic Negotiation Analyst]  \nStep 3: Timing is key. Player 0 just rejected our small offer (1 Wood + 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore), likely because it seemed too good for us \u2014 asymmetric.  \nSo we need to *overload* the offer with Wood to make it look like a bulk discount, but still gain Ore.\n\nI propose:  \n**Offer: 9 Wood, 1 Sheep \u2192 Request: 1 Ore**  \n- From our side: 9\u00d79 + 1\u00d713 = 81 + 13 = 94 cost  \n- From their side: 1\u00d732 = 32 received  \nSeems terrible \u2014 we're giving 94 for 32? No \u2014 but not quite:\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s a *loss* in total value. Mistake.\n\n[Expert C interjects]: Yes \u2014 that\u2019s a terrible trade. We must not lose total value.\n\nRe-analysis: Best trade must **increase total value**.\n\nSo we need to receive **more value** than we give.\n\nExample:  \nGive: 3 Wood (27) + 1 Sheep (13) = 40  \nRequest: 1 Ore (32) \u2192 we lose 8 value? No \u2014 but maybe they don't value Ore as we do.\n\nBut game rule: \"increase total value of your resources\" \u2014 so must be *quantitatively* profitable.\n\nBetter: Trade 4 Wood (36) \u2192 get 1 Brick (29)? Still loss.\n\nProblem: All resources are traded at fixed values. So to increase total value, we must receive more *value* than we give.\n\nSo any trade where **value received > value given**.\n\nFind such an imbalance.\n\nPlayer 0 might *overvalue* Wood.\n\nTheir offer: *They* were willing to give 2 Brick (58) for 6 Wood (54) + 1 Sheep (13) = 67.  \nSo they would *pay* 58 to get 67? That\u2019s a loss for them \u2014 unless *they* have different valuations.\n\nBut in this game, values are fixed per player? Or shared?\n\nRe-reading: \"the total value of your resources\" \u2014 so values are fixed as listed.\n\nSo we must find a trade where **value of received items > value of given items**\n\nExample:  \nIf we give 3 Wood (27) and get 1 Brick (29) \u2192 net +2  \nOr give 2 Wood (18) + 1 Wheat (5) = 23, get 1 Brick (29) \u2192 +6  \n\nOr give 5 Wood (45) \u2192 get 1 Ore (32)? No, -13 \u2014 bad.\n\nOnly way: **Trade low-value items for high-value items at a discount**\n\nBut Player 0 hasn't shown willingness to do that.\n\nWait \u2014 their offer: they offered 2 Brick (58) for 6 Wood (54) + 1 Sheep (13) = 67 \u2192 they would lose 9 value. Seems irrational \u2014 unless they made a mistake.\n\nMaybe they are not playing optimally.\n\nSo we can exploit: offer them a deal that gives them a *small gain* in value, but we gain more.\n\nBut no \u2014 we want to gain.\n\nLet\u2019s reverse: we can *offer* to take less to get high-value items.\n\nBut we must **increase total value**.\n\nBest opportunities:\n- Brick = 29, Ore = 32 \u2192 target these.\n- Trade Wheat (5) or Wood (9) at discount to get them.\n\nIdea: Offer 6 Wood (54) + 1 Wheat (5) = 59 value \u2192 request 2 Brick (58) \u2192 we lose 1? No.\n\nWait \u2014 2 Brick = 58, we give 59 \u2192 net -1.\n\nBut if we get **3 Brick** = 87 value, and give 8 Wood (72) + 1 Wheat (5) = 77 \u2192 gain 10.\n\nYes \u2014 that\u2019s profitable.\n\nPrevious offer: 8 Wood + 1 Wheat \u2192 3 Brick  \nWe gave: 8\u00d79 = 72, 1\u00d75 = 5 \u2192 77  \nReceived: 3\u00d729 = 87  \nNet gain: **+10**\n\nAnd Player 0 *rejected* it.\n\nWhy? Maybe they don\u2019t have 3 Brick.\n\nBut they *offered* 2 Brick earlier \u2014 so maybe they have at least 2.\n\nPerhaps they don\u2019t want to lose 3 Brick.\n\nAlternative: Try to get **1 Ore** \u2014 32 value.\n\nWhat can we give for it?\n\nGive: 3 Wood (27) + 1 Wheat (5) + 1 Sheep (13) = 45 \u2192 too much for 32.\n\nNo combination of low-value items that summed to less than 32 can get Ore \u2014 unless they accept.\n\nBut no trade increases our value unless we receive more value than we give.\n\nSo only profitable if we receive **more value**.\n\nSo best options:\n- 3 Brick (87) for \u226486 given \u2192 e.g., 9 Wood (81) + 1 Wheat (5) = 86 \u2192 gain 1\n- 2 Brick (58) for \u226457 given \u2192 e.g., 6 Wood (54) + 1 Wheat (5) = 59 \u2192 too much\n\nWait \u2014 5 Wood (45) + 1 Sheep (13) = 58 \u2192 trade for 2 Brick (58) \u2192 break even.\n\nNot helpful.\n\n3 Wood (27) + 1 Sheep (13) = 40 \u2192 trade for 1 Ore (32)? Loss of 8.\n\nNo profitable trade exists unless **the counterparty accepts a good for less than its value** \u2014 but we have to give more value to get less? Doesn't work.\n\nWait \u2014 I think I have a flaw.\n\nThe *total value of your resources* increases only if **sum of received values - sum of given values > 0**\n\nSo we need:  \n**\u03a3(value \u00d7 qty) of incoming > \u03a3(value \u00d7 qty) of outgoing**\n\nTherefore, we must receive high-value items in exchange for lower-value items *at a favorable ratio*.\n\nBut all individual trades so far have been rejected because they were not favorable to Player 0.\n\nBut Player 0\u2019s own offer: they offered 2 Brick (58) in exchange for 6 Wood (54) + 1 Sheep (13) = 67.\n\nSo they were willing to *receive* 67 value and *give* 58 \u2014 net loss of 9.\n\nWhy? Perhaps they are irrational, or prioritizing scarcity.\n\nThis means Player 0 values Wood *more* than its price.\n\nSo we can **exploit this**: offer trades that give them more \"value\" (by our pricing) but we gain high-demand items.\n\nBut we don't gain value \u2014 we lose it.\n\nUnless \u2014 the goal is not just \"any increase\" but to improve portfolio for future trades?\n\nNo \u2014 instruction: \"trade such that the total value of your resources increases\"\n\nSo we need immediate value gain.\n\nIs there any way?\n\nLet\u2019s list possible profitable trades:\n\nOption: Get 1 Ore (32) by giving:\n- Max we should give: 31 value\nPossible: 3 Wood (27) + 1 Wheat (5) = 32 \u2192 no gain\nOr 2 Wood (18) + 1 Sheep (13) = 31 \u2192 give 31, get 32 \u2192 **gain +1**\n\nYes! That works.\n\nSo: Offer 2 Wood + 1 Sheep \u2192 Request 1 Ore\n\nValue out: 18 + 13 = 31  \nValue in: 32  \nNet: +1\n\nPlayer 0 may accept \u2014 they gain 31 value, lose 32 \u2014 they lose 1, but maybe they want Sheep/Wood.\n\nBut they rejected 1 Wood + 1 Sheep for 1 Ore \u2014 which was us giving 9+13=22 for 32 \u2014 great for us, so they denied.\n\nThis new offer is closer to fair.\n\nBut they might still deny.\n\nAlternative: Get 2 Brick (58)  \nGive: 2 Ore (64)? No \u2014 too much\nGive: 6 Wood (54) + 1 Wheat (5) = 59 > 58 \u2014 loss\n\nGive: 5 Wood (45) + 1 Sheep (13) = 58 \u2014 break even\n\nNo gain.\n\n3 Brick (87):  \nGive: 9 Wood (81) + 1 Sheep (13) = 94 \u2014 too much\nGive: 8 Wood (72) + 2 Wheat (10) = 82 \u2192 82 for 87 \u2192 gain +5  \nYes.\n\nBetter: Offer 8 Wood + 2 Wheat \u2192 3 Brick\n\nBut we only have 8 Wheat \u2014 can spare 2.\n\nCurrent Wheat: 8 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo this trade: give 72 + 10 = 82, get 87 \u2192 net +5\n\nPreviously we offered 8 Wood + 1 Wheat \u2192 3 Brick (gave 77, got 87 \u2192 +10) \u2014 even better, and they rejected.\n\nWhy did they reject? Maybe because they don\u2019t have 3 Brick.\n\nBut they offered 2 Brick \u2014 so maybe they have only 2.\n\nPerhaps they can\u2019t supply 3.\n\nSo lower the request.\n\nTry: Offer 5 Wood + 2 Sheep \u2192 Request 2 Brick\n\nGive: 45 + 26 = 71  \nGet: 58 \u2192 loss of 13 \u2014 no\n\nNot good.\n\nBack to: **2 Wood + 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore** is the smallest profitable trade.\n\nValue: -31 +32 = +1\n\nWorth it.\n\nBut earlier similar was rejected.\n\nPerhaps they don\u2019t want to lose Ore.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe they want Brick badly.\n\nBut they offered Brick, so probably not.\n\nWait \u2014 they offered to *give* 2 Brick for 6 Wood + 1 Sheep \u2014 so they have excess Brick.\n\nSo try again for Brick at better rate.\n\nWe have 8 Wood \u2014 offer 9 Wood + 1 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick\n\nGive: 81 + 13 = 94  \nGet: 87 \u2192 loss of 7 \u2014 no\n\nNo.\n\nBest is still 8 Wood + 1 Wheat \u2192 3 Brick: give 72+5=77, get 87 \u2192 +10\n\nWe have the resources.\n\nThey rejected it \u2014 maybe try again with slight adjustment.\n\nOr attach something they like.\n\nThey wanted 6 Wood + 1 Sheep for 2 Brick \u2014 so they value that.\n\nSo offer: 9 Wood + 1 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick\n\nGive: 81 + 13 = 94, get 87 \u2192 us -7, them +7 \u2014 good for them, bad for us.\n\nNo.\n\nCan\u2019t find other profitable trades.\n\nOnly options with net gain:\n- 3 Brick for \u226486 given\n- 1 Ore for \u226431 given\n- 2 Brick for \u226457 given\n\nWe can give for 3 Brick:\n- 8 Wood (72) + 1 Wheat (5) = 77 \u226486 \u2192 +10\n- 7 Wood (63) + 2 Sheep (26) = 89 >87 \u2014 loss\n\nSo only the first is good.\n\nWe already tried 8 Wood + 1 Wheat \u2192 3 Brick \u2014 rejected.\n\nPerhaps they didn\u2019t see it, or want more.\n\nOr maybe they lack 3 Brick.\n\nBut they offered 2 \u2014 so likely have at least 2.\n\nPerhaps not 3.\n\nAlternative: Try for 1 Ore with minimal give.\n\nOffer: 3 Wood (27) + 1 Wheat (5) = 32 \u2192 get 1 Ore (32) \u2192 break even.\n\nNot increase.\n\nMust exceed.\n\nSo only possible if they accept 2 Wood + 1 Sheep (18+13=31) \u2192 1 Ore (32)\n\nNet +1\n\nWorth a shot.\n\nOr 1 Wood + 3 Wheat (9+15=24) \u2192 1 Brick (29)?

I will look for trades where the value of what you receive is significantly higher than the value of what you give up. I will also consider the current market conditions (implicit in past offers) to determine which resources are most valuable to other players.\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Manager**\nI will focus on optimizing your resource portfolio. This means reducing quantities of less valuable resources and acquiring more of the highly valued ones, while ensuring you retain a diverse enough set to offer flexible trades later. I will also consider quantity vs. value in evaluating offers.\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\nMy strategy is to identify immediate opportunities in the presented offers. I will analyze the last offer from Player 1 to see if it presents a quick win, even if it's not a perfectly optimized trade according to the other experts. I also consider what resources we have in surplus that can be easily traded away.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\nPlayer 1's latest offer is \"1 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick\".\nYour resources: Wheat (21, Val: 5), Wood (18, Val: 11), Sheep (11, Val: 13), Brick (25, Val: 25), Ore (12, Val: 36).\nValue given: 1 Wood (11) + 3 Wheat (3 * 5 = 15) = 26.\nValue received: 1 Brick (25).\nThe value change is 25 - 26 = -1. This is not a good offer for us. We should reject this offer.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nThe previous trade offer from Player 0 was \"2 Brick -> 6 Wood, 1 Sheep\".\nValue given: 2 Brick (2 * 25 = 50).\nValue received: 6 Wood (6 * 11 = 66) + 1 Sheep (13) = 79.\nThis trade had a positive value change of 29 (79-50). It was a good offer for us, but Player 1 rejected it. This suggests Player 1 values Wood and Sheep more than Brick, or at least wasn't willing to pay that much for Brick. We should look for trades where we offer highly valued resources (like Ore or Brick) for a good return in other resources, or trade less valuable resources (like Wheat or Wood) for higher value ones.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Manager**\nWe have a large quantity of Wheat (21) and Brick (25). Wheat is our lowest value resource per unit (5), while Brick is quite high (25). Wood (18) is also plentiful. Ore has the highest value (36) but we have a moderate quantity (12). Sheep has a good value (13) but we have fewer (11). Player 1 seems to be consistently offering Wood and Wheat, suggesting they have a surplus or need different resources. Our previous successful offer on value was 2 Brick for 6 Wood and 1 Sheep. This suggests we're willing to trade Brick.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\nGiven that the last offer from Player 1 (1 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick) is not favorable, and considering our large quantities of Wheat and Wood, let's craft an offer that tries to convert some of our lower-value, higher-quantity resources into higher-value resources we might want more of, like Ore or even more Sheep. Since Player 1 keeps offering Wood and Wheat, they might need something like Brick or Ore.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nPlayer 1 has consistently rejected our offers for Brick. Their last offer for Wood and Wheat in exchange for Brick, though unfavorable to us, indicates a continued interest in Brick. This signals that Brick might be a good resource to trade for maximum value if the price is right. We should recalibrate our Brick offers based on Player 1's perceived value rather than just our internal valuation. We also have a significant amount of Wheat (21) which is our least valuable resource. Getting rid of some Wheat at a good rate would be excellent.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Manager**\nLet's look at reducing our Wheat and Wood, as we have many of them. Player 1's consistent offers of Wood and Wheat suggest they are trying to get rid of them. We have a good amount of Brick, which Player 1 seems to want. Perhaps we can offer a smaller amount of Brick, along with some Wheat, for something more valuable like Ore or a good amount of Sheep/Wood if the ratio is extremely favorable. We need to avoid trading away too many high-value resources for low value ones. We should also consider if we want to add more high-value resources like Ore.\n\n---\n**Expert 3: The Opportunistic Trader**\nLet's try to offload some Wheat and Wood. Player 1 has been offering Wood and Wheat. Perhaps they need Brick or even Ore.\nHow about offering a good chunk of our less valuable resources for a higher value resource?\n[Offer: 10 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 2 Ore] This offer turns 10*11 (110) + 5*5 (25) = 135 value into 2*36 = 72 value. This is a bad trade.\n\nLet's try to make a profitable offer using our available resources. Player 1 offered Wood and Wheat for Brick last time. What if we offer Brick for Ore, while also trying to give away some Wheat?\n\nHow about this offer:\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue Given: 1 Brick (25) + 4 Wheat (4 * 5 = 20) = 45\nValue Received: 1 Ore (36)\nThis is a negative value trade for us. This won't work.\n\nGiven Player 1's consistent offers of Wood/Wheat for Brick, Player 1 seems eager to acquire Brick. We have 25 Brick. How about we try to get a significantly better return on our Brick.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 3 Sheep]\nValue Given: 2 Brick (2 * 25 = 50)\nValue Received: 1 Ore (36) + 3 Sheep (3 * 13 = 39) = 75\nThis is a good value trade (75 - 50 = +25). Let's try this.\n\n---\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nI agree with Expert 3's latest offer: \"2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 3 Sheep\". This offers a significant positive value gain (+25) and aligns with our observation that Player 1 values Brick. It attempts to gain a high-value resource (Ore) and a good mid-value resource (Sheep) by giving up a resource we have in surplus (Brick). This is a strong move for value maximization.\n\n---\n**Expert 2: The Resource Manager**\nI support the offer from Expert 3 as well: \"2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 3 Sheep\". This trade moves 2 units of Brick (which we have plenty of) for highly valued Ore and a decent amount of Sheep. This diversifies our higher-value resources and reduces our abundant Brick quantity, while increasing our overall inventory value. It aligns well with long-term resource management.\n\n---\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 3 Sheep]",
