      "response": "### Expert 1: Resource Maximizer\n\n**Step 1:** As a Resource Maximizer, I will analyze which resources provide the best return on investment. Wheat and Wood have decent values, but my focus will be on Brick and Ore because they have higher values. \n\n**Step 2:** I notice that I have a large quantity of Sheep, which could be traded for resources of higher value. The goal is to trade Sheep for Brick, since at a glance, Brick has a substantial value. I propose the following offer: \n\n**Proposed Action:** \n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]\n\n---\n\n### Expert 2: Risk Manager\n\n**Step 1:** As a Risk Manager, I\u2019ll evaluate the stability of the offers being made and the resultant resources. \n\n**Step 2:** I see that trading Sheep\u2014currently having a quantity of 20\u2014will lower my resource count of one type but potentially provides high-value resources like Brick. However, I need to ensure I don\u2019t deplete my resources excessively. \n\nLooking closely at the proposal to trade 3 Sheep and 2 Ore for 5 Brick and 2 Sheep, this trade seems beneficial as it provides a net gain of Brick while maintaining some of my Sheep resource.\n\n**Proposed Action:** \nI endorse the offer because it seems to be a net positive trade.\n\n---\n\n### Expert 3: Opportunistic Trader\n\n**Step 1:** As an Opportunistic Trader, I will focus on identifying whether the current scenario allows capitalizing on immediate gains. \n\n**Step 2:** Since there is currently no offer from Player 0, I suggest finding a way to initiate a deal where I can trade lesser-valued resources for higher-valued ones. \n\nThe proposed trade of 3 Sheep and 2 Ore for 5 Brick and 2 Sheep appears favorable since Brick is of higher value, and additionally receiving Sheep back keeps some quantity intact.\n\n**Proposed Action:**\nI will support the proposed offer as it seems beneficial in both resource return and value maximization.\n\n---\n\n### Group Consensus\n\nAll experts are aligned with the trading proposal:\n- [Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]\n\nGiven the unanimous support, I will proceed with this trade to maximize my resource values. \n\n**Final Action:**\n[Accept]",

      "response": "Let\u2019s assemble three distinct expert advisors, each focused on one key aspect of the negotiation, and have them deliberate in lock-step.\n\nExpert Profiles  \n1. Value Analyst: Computes net value change for every potential trade.  \n2. Stock Strategist: Tracks surplus / deficit of each resource and positions Player 0 for long-term flexibility.  \n3. Negotiation Psychologist: Rapidly predicts how Player 1 will react to counter-proposals and how reputation (future deals) could be affected.\n\nTurn-based deliberation (one step per expert, then next step for all):\n\nStep 1  \n\u2022 Value Analyst: Accepting the offer \u201c3 Sheep, 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\u201d yields:  \n\u2003- Lose 3 Sheep \u2192 \u20133 \u00d7 14 = \u201342 value.  \n\u2003- Lose 2 Ore \u2192 \u20132 \u00d7 33 = \u201366 value.  \n\u2003- Gain 5 Brick \u2192 +5 \u00d7 26 = +130 value.  \n\u2003Net change = \u201342 \u201366 +130 = +22 net value.  \n\n\u2022 Stock Strategist: After this single trade my inventory would be: Wheat 15 | Wood 22 | Sheep 9 (+9 net) | Brick 17 (+5) | Ore 20 (\u20132). Brick rises from marginal surplus to more comfortable buffer, but Sheep still looks healthy; Wheat and Wood untouched; Ore dip minimal. Needs more leeway to trade later, so more brick is welcome.\n\n\u2022 Negotiation Psychologist: Player 1 offering tunneled resources (3 Sheep + 2 Ore) to secure Brick suggests Brick is heavily in demand on their side. Accepting now could set a precedent that Player 0 values Brick a lot\u2014good leverage for future rounds. Yet Player 1 might be probing upper limit; a quick accept could squander minor extra margin.\n\nStep 2  \n\u2022 Value Analyst (scrutinize): +22 net value is solid. Even after acceptance, new Brick total rises to 17, still manageable without overshooting diminishing returns. No downside on overall value trajectory.\n\n\u2022 Stock Strategist: Post-trade Ore stock 20 remains ample; opportunity cost of 2 Ore is low, 3 Sheep off 12 total is 25 % reduction but still usable. Run 3 more turns and still retain flexibility.\n\n\u2022 Negotiation Psychologist: There\u2019s psychological upside in fast cooperation\u2014Player 1 may reciprocate later when I want their excess Wood (22 at value 11). Alternatively, I could counter with \u201c4 Sheep \u2192 6 Brick\u201d (slightly worse for me at \u201356 \u2192 +156 net +100, so sub-optimal). Thus psychologically both agree the offered trade is within fair window.\n\nCorollary: All experts remain, no flaws revealed.\n\n[Accept]",

So 4 Wood = 44 points, 3 Ore = 99 points. Simple arithmetic says I\u2019d be giving away 55 net value.\n\nExpert 2: I currently hold 22 Ore and 22 Wood. If I shed 3 Ore and receive 4 Wood, my Ore drops to 19 and Wood rises to 26. The total inventory of other resources (Brick = 17 after the first trade, Sheep = 17, Wheat = 15) remains intact\u2014no imminent liquidity crisis either way.\n\nExpert 3: I have 22 Wood already; an extra 4 does nothing drastically positive. Likewise several Ores but 3 less would not cripple me. However, based strictly on the fixed card-values, the exchange rate Player 1 is demanding is 11 to 33 (3 Wood \u2248 1 Ore). That ratio beats the rate currently offered (4 Wood just equals 3 Ore, i.e., ~11\u219233=roughly 1:3). At face value this is a bad deal for me.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Step 2 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nExpert 1: Could the relative values shift in later rounds? Not enough data; must go with numbers we have. Stick to rejecting bad arithmetic.\n\nExpert 2: My resource balance after the trade would lean heavily toward Wood (26 vs. 19 Ore). Since Ore ranks highest in my valuation, stockpiling more Ore and fewer Wood is preferable. Hence leaning negative.\n\nExpert 3: Unless Player 1 sweetens their offer later, the 4-Wood-for-3-Ore rate provides no surplus value. A counter-offer of \u201c5 Wood \u2192 2 Ore\u201d would still leave me slightly unfavorable. No incentive to accept current offer.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Step 3 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAll three concur: decline.\n\nI therefore reply:\n\n[Deny]",

Post-trade we are still heavy Ore (660 value) and now lighter on Brick (182). Good: diversification. Bad: Brick dropped from 12\u21927 \u2192 risk if Brick price spikes later.\n\n- **Ophelia:**  \n  The trade Player 1 offered (3 Sheep+2 Ore \u2194 5 Brick+2 Sheep) looks like Player 1 valued each Brick at about 6.4 in Ore terms. Valuation check: in our values Brick is 26 vs. Ore 33 \u2192 Brick worth 0.79 Ore. From Player 1\u2019s perspective 2 Ore \u2248 1.6 Ore value and 1 Sheep (val 14) vs giving up 5 Brick (val 130) \u2192 offer in their eyes was 46 Giovenz value for 130 \u2192 Giving bad ratio. Yet we got profit because our huge heavy Ore weighting made marginal Ore value to us drop. So net, I agree accepting gave us positive delta.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Latest Rejected Offer\nPlayer 1 proposes: 4 Wood \u2192 3 Ore  \n- **Valeria:** 4 Wood = 4\u00d711 = 44; 3 Ore = 3\u00d733 = 99 \u2192 we\u2019d lose 99-44 = 55 value \u2192 Deny obvious.\n\n- **Blake:** From balance view: giving away 3 Ore (we have 20, still high) for Wood (we have 22) seems poor diversification; adds volatility.\n\n- **Ophelia:** Obvious red-flag, -55 on contact. Move on.\n\n#### Step 3: Next Move Identification\nAll three experts still in.\n\n- **Valeria Marginal Value Insight:**  \n  After the earlier rearrangement, fractional marginal value caps: Brick quantity low \u2192 marginal utility high (last unit worth 26+ utility). Ore still dense (20 units) \u2192 marginal Ore worth below 33 to us. Wood and Sheep ok.\n\n- **Blake Diversification Need:**  \n  Brick down to 7 \u2192 probably want to inch back toward 8\u201310 to reduce risk. Simultaneously, 20 Ore is huge; we can afford to offload 3\u20134 units at slight discounts.\n\n- **Ophelia Action Plan:**  \n  Design a mutual-gain offer that looks attractive to Player 1 and yields net positive value to us via our different valuations.\n\n#### *Step 4 (consensus) \u2013 Form Proposal for Next Turn*\n- Proposed Offer: **[Offer: 3 Ore -> 4 Brick]**  \n  Our valuation: 3 Ole = 3\u00d733 = 99; 4 Brick = 4\u00d726 = 104 \u2192 Net +5 for us.  \n  Likely attractive: Player 1 rates Ore higher than Brick (per last offer they overvalued Brick) so this small Ore-for-Brick swap may appeal.",

      "response": "Let's analyze the current situation from three different expert perspectives: a Trade Analyst, a Resource Strategist, and a Market Evaluator. \n\n### Trade Analyst\n- Step 1: I notice that Player 1 has a strong resource pool with significant values. The last offer made by Player 0 (3 Ore for 4 Brick) indicates that they are aware of the high value of Brick. However, it\u2019s essential to assess whether the trade is beneficial for Player 1. Player 1 currently has:\n  - 11 Ore (Value: 35)\n  - 15 Brick (Value: 28)\n  - Thus, I conclude that trading 3 Ore (Value: 105) for 4 Brick (Value: 28) is not a favorable trade for Player 1, as it results in a significant net loss. \n\n### Resource Strategist\n- Step 1: My focus is on strengthening Player 1's resource base. Analyzing the previous successful trade (3 Sheep and 2 Ore for 5 Brick and 2 Sheep), Player 1 gained more Brick, which is critical for acquiring larger trades. Player 1 should avoid trading core resources like Ore, which have high value, unless they receive a beneficial trade back. I recommend denying this latest trade offer from Player 0 and instead consider making further resource offers that focus on obtaining favorable trades for high-value resources like Ore or gaining additional Brick.\n\n### Market Evaluator\n- Step 1: In the current market scenario, Player 0 is trying to acquire Brick to improve their own position, seeing its high value in contrast to the quantity of Ore they might have. Player 1, having just successfully traded for Brick, may not need to accept any more Brick offers unless they can squeeze more value out of the deal. I suggest Player 1 reject the current trade offer, as it does not capitalize on their resources effectively. Player 1 should aim to negotiate higher-value trades that can increase their resource value.\n\nNow let's move forward with decision-making based on these evaluations:\n\n1. **Trade Analyst**: [Deny]\n2. **Resource Strategist**: [Deny]\n3. **Market Evaluator**: [Deny]\n\n### Current Status:\n- Player 0 made the offer: 3 Ore for 4 Brick.\n- Player 1 has collectively decided to **deny** this offer based on the evaluations. \n\n**Next Steps for Player 1**:\n- Consider making an offer that aims at acquiring high-value resources while giving away lesser-valued resources, such as offering surplus Wheat or Wood for Ore or Brick. This would help maintain a strong resource position. \n\nWhat would you like to offer in the next turn?",

My job is to craft an offer that satisfies Expert 1\u2019s value check and Expert 2\u2019s balance check while sounding generous to Player 1.\u201d\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nStep 2 \u2013 Analyse the rejected offers so far  \n\nExpert 1: \u201cPlayer 0 just declined 4 Wood \u2192 3 Ore. Value-wise, 4 Wood is 44, 3 Ore is 99. A net loss of 55 for us, so declining was correct. No regret; I stay.\u201d\n\nExpert 2: \u201cWood count would have fallen to 18; Ore would have grown to 25. That actually improves our Ore surplus further, which is bad from diversification standpoint. Declining was consistent with my advice; no need to leave.\u201d\n\nExpert 3: \u201cThe denial signals we are not desperate for Ore. Good; we retain bargaining leverage. Continue.\u201d\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nStep 3 \u2013 Evaluate Player 0\u2019s latest proposal  \n\nExpert 1: \u201cOur offer 3 Ore (99 value) for 4 Brick (104 value) would raise total value by 5. That is a pure gain; I approve.\u201d\n\nExpert 2: \u201cAfter the trade we\u2019d hold 19 Ore and 16 Brick. Reduces both Ore surplus and Brick shortfall, aligning better with portfolio balance. I approve.\u201d\n\nExpert 3: \u201cThe offer is small enough (just 3 Ore) that Player 1 might accept as \u2018rounding out\u2019 their set without feeling exploited. I will push for exactly this trade and only this trade.\u201d\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nConverged advice to Player 0  \n\nAll three experts converge:  \n- Re-open negotiations with Player 1 for an exchange of 3 Ore for 4 Brick.  \n- Do not add extra resources to sweeten; the offer already yields net value gain.  \n\nIf Player 1 counters, re-run the same checks.",

      "response": "Let's analyze the current resources, the past trades, and what actions we can take to increase the value of my resources.\n\n### Current Resource Summary:\n- **Wheat**: 14 qty, Value: 6\n- **Wood**: 18 qty, Value: 9\n- **Sheep**: 17 qty (after prior trade), Value: 15\n- **Brick**: 20 qty (after prior trade), Value: 28\n- **Ore**: 9 qty (after prior trade), Value: 35\n\n### Expert 1: Resource Evaluator\nThis expert focuses on analyzing the current resource values and finding optimal trades based on the value ratios.\n\n- **Step 1**: Compare the current values to see which resources can be used to gain more valued resources.\n- Sheep (15) and Ore (35) have good value; however, Brick (28 after trade) is quite valuable to maintain.\n- It may be beneficial to trade Sheep for Wood or Ore, depending on the other player's needs. \n\n**Expert Recommendation**: Offer 4 Sheep for 3 Ore (which can be useful for future trades). \n\n### Expert 2: Market Trader\nThis expert determines the worth of resources based on demand and offers from the other player.\n\n- **Step 1**: Player 0 seems interested in obtaining Ore, but they rejected all offers that could involve Ore.\n- Since they currently have no need for more Ore, pivot to offer a quantity of Wood in exchange for Brick, since they showed interest last time. \n\n**Expert Recommendation**: Offer 6 Wood for 3 Brick.\n\n### Expert 3: Tactical Negotiator\nThis expert looks at the negotiation potential and strategizes based on past experiences and future possibilities.\n\n- **Step 1**: Player 0 has accepted a previous trade that benefited me. Being assertive might lead to a more advantageous position.\n- Recognize that we need to calculate future value increases to leverage better trades.\n- Instead of small trades, targeting bulk trades could help maximize value growth. \n\n**Expert Recommendation**: Offer 4 Ore for 6 Brick to maximize the increase in Brick quantity.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Evaluating Offers**: I will present the suggested offers based on the expert analysis and see what trades I can initiate.\n\n**Player 1's Next Offer**:  \n1.

Every additional Brick is thus worth more to me than any single other resource. Ore, though plentiful, is still solid at 33 but showing diminishing surplus; Sheep is already over-supplied.  \nNext step: quantify how much extra Brick is worth compared with giving up Ore.\n\n---\n\nExpert-\u03b2   \u201cOffer-Counter-Offer Strategist\u201d  \nStep 1: Inspect Player 1\u2019s new proposal.  \nThey offer 4 Sheep \u2192 3 Ore, i.e. gaining 3\u00d733 = 99 value and giving 4\u00d714 = 56 value \u2013 a loss-to-you of 43. Reject unless re-framed.  \nHowever, their own dual-resource barter (Wood vs Ore) failed earlier, so Player 1 appears Sheep-heavy but may be desperate for sure-plan Ore. That means leverage exists.  \nNext step: construct a package that gives them 3 Sheep instead, returns you at least 4 Brick, and improves your net.\n\n---\n\nExpert-\u03b3   \u201cEnd-game Portfolio Optimizer\u201d  \nStep 1: Keep the cumulative value trend \u22640 over the match. Net change so far is \u201122. Every future trade must make up +22 plus any additional.\nBrick is the bottleneck and every missing unit now costs me downstream plans.  \nNext step: If I import 7 more Brick in any swap, my new total becomes (Brick total value) 12\u00d726 = 312 \u2192 net gain of 182 \u2013 driving the portfolio decisively positive. Anything involving Ore is acceptable only if Brick ratio \u2265 4:3.\n\n---\n\nOpen Floor \u2013 Expert summaries to Player 0:\n1. Expert-\u03b1 urges Brick priority with preference ratios > 1:1 Ore:Brick.  \n2. Expert-\u03b2 sees Player 1 as Sheep-heavy and willing to over-pay Ore if converted via Brick.  \n3. Expert-\u03b3 demands immediate 7+ Brick acquisition to flip back to value-positive territory.\n\nConsensus proposal drafted:  \nUpgrade Brick immediately. Counter Player 1 with a Brick-centric swap unless an even better local deal forms.\n\nDecision Token for turn-4:  \nI reject the 4 Sheep \u2192 3 Ore from Player 1.  \nNext public offer from me: [Offer: 3 Ore -> 4 Brick].\n\n(State machine now awaits both Player 1\u2019s possible agree/disagree and any new permutations.)",
