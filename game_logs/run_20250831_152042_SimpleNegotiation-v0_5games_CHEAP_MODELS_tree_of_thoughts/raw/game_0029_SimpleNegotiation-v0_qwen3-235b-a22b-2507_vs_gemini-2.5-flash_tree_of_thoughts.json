      "response": "[Expert1: Economist]  \nInitial Analysis: My focus is on maximizing value through marginal utility and opportunity cost. Currently, Ore and Brick have the highest individual values (35 and 28), but I must assess whether holding them is more valuable than trading them for resources with higher growth potential or better exchange ratios. Sheep are valued at 17, which is moderate, but we hold a large quantity (22), suggesting possible surplus. Wheat (value 6) is low-value; we have 9 but may want to acquire more if trade ratios are favorable. Wood (10) is also relatively low, though we have a healthy 17. I will evaluate potential trades based on value-per-unit exchange efficiency.\n\n[Expert2: Game Theorist]  \nInitial Analysis: I consider strategic incentives, counterparty behavior, and credible offers. Since we don\u2019t know other players\u2019 valuations or inventories, I assess likely trading patterns in a Catan-like environment: Brick and Ore are often high-demand mid-to-late game resources (for cities and development cards). Players may seek Sheep for settlement expansion. I will analyze incoming offers for fairness and long-term strategic advantage, and craft offers that appear balanced but slightly favorable to us, anticipating rational acceptance.\n\n[Expert3: Resource Strategist]  \nInitial Analysis: I focus on inventory balance and future trading power. Holding 22 Sheep is a surplus \u2014 more than likely needed for immediate settlements (4 per settlement). We have strong Brick and Ore \u2014 useful for cities (2 Brick + 3 Ore) or development cards (1 Sheep + 1 Wheat + 1 Ore). But if we can convert excess Sheep and some Ore into higher-value assets or diversify for future trades, we should. I note that exchanging 2\u20133 Sheep + 1\u20132 Ore for 2\u20133 Brick could be efficient, but better deals may exist. I will look to reduce Sheep overstock while gaining Wheat (scarce for us relative to needs) or more Wood.\n\n[Expert1: Economist]  \nStep 2: Calculating trade value efficiency. Suppose we trade **3 Sheep (3\u00d717=51)** and **2 Ore (2\u00d735=70)** \u2014 total offered value: **121**. Requesting **5 Brick (5\u00d728=140)** and **2 Sheep (34)** \u2014 total requested value: **174**. This is a net gain of 53 in total value, but no rational player would accept giving more value than they receive. Therefore, such an offer is exploitative and likely to be denied. A better strategy: offer surplus Sheep at a slight discount to entice trade. Example: **4 Sheep (68)** for **2 Wheat (12)** and **1 Wood (10)** \u2014 we gain low-cost resources, total requested value 22 \u2014 seems underpowered. Alternatively: **3 Sheep + 1 Ore (51+35=86)** for **4 Brick (112)** \u2014 net gain 26. This seems more plausibly acceptable.\n\n[Expert2: Game Theorist]  \nStep 2: If we make an offer that gives a favorable but not excessive value gain (e.g., net +15 to +30 for us), rational players may accept, especially if they have surplus low-value resources. Offers perceived as unfair lead to denial or retaliation. Best to simulate mutual benefit. Also, early offers should establish credibility. I suggest targeting trades that give us Wheat or Wood \u2014 resources others may undervalue but we need for balance. A player with excess Brick might trade 2 Brick for 3 Sheep \u2014 but that favors them. Reverse: can we offer 3 Sheep for 2 Brick + 1 Wood? That\u2019s 51 offered, 56+10=66 requested \u2014 net +15 for us, plausible.\n\n[Expert3: Resource Strategist]  \nStep 2: We have 22 Sheep \u2014 more than 5 settlements worth. Unless we\u2019re planning massive expansion, we can trade 4\u20136 Sheep. We have only 9 Wheat \u2014 barely 3 cities (need 2 per city). We need at least 10\u201312 Wheat for full development. Thus, Wheat is a priority. Wood (17) is decent, but building roads or settlements consumes 4 Wood per settlement \u2014 so 17 supports ~4 settlements. Could use more. Ideal trade: reduce Sheep, gain Wheat. Propose: [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Wheat, 1 Wood]\n\n[Expert1: Economist]  \nStep 3: Evaluate proposed offer: **3 Sheep (51)** \u2192 **2 Wheat (12) + 1 Wood (10)** = 22 requested. We lose 29 value. That\u2019s terrible. Why give high-value Sheep (17) for low-value Wheat (6) and Wood (10)? Only rational if we desperately need Wheat for upcoming development. But even then, net loss of 29 suggests poor deal unless we can\u2019t trade otherwise. Better: **2 Sheep (34)** \u2192 **1 Wheat (6)**, a 28 loss \u2014 still bad. Alternatively, can we **offer Wheat or Wood to get Brick or Ore**? But we're weak on Wheat. Perhaps the real opportunity is **using Sheep to acquire Ore** \u2014 but we already have 15 Ore. Not ideal.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps I miscalculated. The values are *our* valuations. Others may value differently. If another player values Sheep highly (e.g., needs for settlements) and has excess Wheat, they might accept giving 2 Wheat for 3 Sheep. From their view, they gain Sheep (valuable to them), lose low-value Wheat (to them). So **subjective valuation** matters.\n\nThus, a good trade is one where **our marginal value of what we give < our marginal value of what we receive**, even if total nominal value decreases \u2014 if it improves future optionality.\n\nBut our goal is: \"increase total value of your resources\" \u2014 so we must assume value is fixed per resource. So we must not lose total value.\n\nTherefore, any trade must have:  \n**Value(Received Resources) > Value(Given Resources)**\n\nTo increase total value.\n\nSo trade only if net positive value gain.\n\n[Expert2: Game Theorist]  \nStep 3: Confirmed. The game objective is to **increase total value**, not just utility. So trades must be positive sum *in our valuation*.\n\nTherefore, I revise: we must **only trade if we gain net positive value**.\n\nBest opportunities:\n- Acquire Brick (28) or Ore (35) in exchange for low-value-perceived surplus.\n- But we already have high Brick and Ore.\n- Perhaps trade **Wood or Wheat** to gain **Sheep or Brick** \u2014 but Sheep value is 17, less than Brick/Ore, and we have plenty Sheep.\n- Wait \u2014 **we have 22 Sheep**, but Sheep only valued at 17 \u2014 still lower than Brick (28) and Ore (35). But we can\u2019t gain higher-value resources by trading lower-value ones unless overexchange.\n\nFor example: give 3 Sheep (51) + 1 Wood (10) = 61 \u2192 get 2 Ore (70) \u2192 net gain 9.\n\nOr: 4 Sheep (68) \u2192 2 Brick (56) \u2192 net loss 12 \u2192 bad.\n\nBut: 2 Wood (20) + 1 Wheat (6) = 26 \u2192 get 1 Brick (28) \u2192 net gain 2 \u2192 barely positive.\n\nOr: 2 Sheep (34) \u2192 get 1 Ore (35) \u2192 net gain 1 \u2192 minimal but valid.\n\nBest bet: **target net positive trades, even small**.\n\n[Expert3: Resource Strategist]  \nStep 3: I now see \u2014 value is fixed and we must increase sum.\n\nCurrent total value:  \n9\u00d76 (Wheat) = 54  \n17\u00d710 (Wood) = 170  \n22\u00d717 (Sheep) = 374  \n12\u00d728 (Brick) = 336  \n15\u00d735 (Ore) = 525  \nTotal: **1459**\n\nWe need trades that increase this.\n\nPossible: offer combinations where we give low-value-per-unit resources and get high.\n\nBut our lowest-value are Wheat (6), Wood (10), then Sheep (17), then Brick (28), Ore (35).\n\nSo ideally, trade Wheat or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\nBut others may not want Wheat/Wood.\n\nAlternatively, **offer Sheep at a discount to get Brick or Ore**.\n\nBest small gain: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]  \nWe give: 2\u00d717 + 1\u00d710 = 34 + 10 = 44  \nWe get: 1\u00d735 = 35 \u2192 net loss 9 \u2192 invalid.\n\n[Offer: 1 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]  \n6 + 20 = 26 \u2192 28 \u2192 net +2 \u2192 \u2705 valid.\n\nBut do we want to give away Wood? 17 is reasonable, but growth potential.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Wheat]  \n51 \u2192 35 + 6 = 41 \u2192 net -10 \u2192 bad.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]  \n17+10=27 \u2192 28 \u2192 net +1 \u2192 \u2705 barely positive.\n\nEven better: [Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick] \u2192 20+6=26 \u2192 28 \u2192 +2\n\nOr: [Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat] \u2192 30 \u2192 28+6=34 \u2192 net +4 \u2192 even better!\n\nWait: **3 Wood (30)** \u2192 get **1 Brick (28) + 1 Wheat (6) = 34** \u2192 net +4 \u2192 YES.\n\nWe have 17 Wood \u2014 sacrificing 3 is acceptable.\n\nWe lack Wheat (only 9) \u2014 but gaining 1 helps.\n\nPropose: [Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat]\n\n[Expert1: Economist]  \nStep 4: I confirm \u2014 that trade yields net +4 value. It\u2019s efficient. We trade a moderate surplus (Wood, value 10) for Brick (28) and Wheat (6), both of higher unit value than Wood. Even though Wheat is low value, the total inflow exceeds outflow.\n\nMoreover, gaining Wheat improves balance for future development cards (Wheat+Sheep+Ore) and cities (2 Wheat per city). Having at least 10+ Wheat is strategic.\n\nThis offer is rational, value-positive, and likely acceptable to a player with excess Wood or who needs development card resources.\n\nI support: [Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat]\n\n[Expert2: Game Theorist]  \nStep 4: This offer appears fair. From the counterparty\u2019s perspective:  \nThey give 1 Brick (28) and 1 Wheat (6) = 34 value (to us), receive 3 Wood (30 to us).  \nThey may perceive it as gaining 3 Wood (which they value possibly higher) for lower-value Wheat and a Brick they might want to hold.\n\nBut in many games, Brick is highly liquid. Players may be willing to trade 1 Brick + 1 Wheat for 3 Wood if they need roads.\n\nThus, the offer is balanced and plausible.\n\nNo expert has left.\n\n[Expert3: Resource Strategist]  \nStep 4: We have 17 Wood \u2014 losing 3 leaves 14, still enough for ~3+ settlements. Gaining 1 Brick brings us to 13, and 1 Wheat to 10 \u2014 crossing threshold for development cards and city planning.\n\nThis improves both total value and strategic flexibility.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat]",

      "response": "[Expert A - Resource Gap Analyst]  \nStep 1: I analyze what resources I\u2019m lacking relative to their value. My current inventory has high quantities of Sheep (22) and Wood (17), but Ore (15) and Brick (12) are lower in quantity despite their high value (Ore = 35, Brick = 28). Wheat is low value (6) but I have a decent amount (9). My goal should be to convert lower-value surplus into higher-value or more useful resources.  \n\n[Expert B - Market Dynamics Strategist]  \nStep 1: I observe that other players likely value Brick and Ore highly due to their high point values. Since I have only 12 Brick and 15 Ore, I may be a buyer, not a seller, in those markets. Sheep (value 17) are mid-tier but I have 22 \u2014 a clear surplus. Trading Sheep for Brick or Ore would increase total value. The rejected offer (3 Sheep \u2192 2 Wheat, 1 Wood) was poor: giving mid-value surplus for low-value goods. No gain.\n\n[Expert C - Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 1: The rejection of my offer suggests Player 1 either doesn't need Sheep or sees the offer as unfair. Since I offered 3 Sheep (17\u00d73 = 51 value) for 2 Wheat (6\u00d72 = 12) and 1 Wood (10), total requested value ~22 \u2014 a lopsided deal in my favor. Player 1 may have rejected because it felt exploitative. I should rebalance offers to appear fair while still increasing my total value.\n\n[Expert A - Resource Gap Analyst]  \nStep 2: I should aim to trade Sheep for Ore or Brick. My Ore (15) is medium, but value is highest (35). Brick (12) is also below mid-tier ideal if used often. Target: gain net +Ore or +Brick. I can afford to spend up to 3\u20135 Sheep if I gain at least 2 Ore or 3 Brick in return.\n\n[Expert B - Market Dynamics Strategist]  \nStep 2: Since Ore and Brick are high-value, offers must include desirable but less critical resources. Sheep are good bait. Optimal trade: offer 4\u20135 Sheep for 2\u20133 Ore, or 3 Sheep + 1 Wood for 3 Brick. Ensure value flow favors me but appears balanced.\n\n[Expert C - Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 2: I should make an offer that feels fair but benefits me. Example: Offer 4 Sheep for 3 Ore. My value: -68 +105 = +37 gain. But to avoid rejection, frame it as equal: 4 Sheep (68) \u2248 3 Ore (105)? No \u2014 too skewed. Instead: 5 Sheep \u2192 3 Ore + 1 Wood? Value out: 85, value in: 105 + 10 = 115 \u2192 net +30. Still good for me, but looks cooperative.\n\n[Expert A - Resource Gap Analyst]  \nStep 3: Wait \u2014 I already have 17 Wood. I don\u2019t need more. Including Wood in requested items is wasteful. Better to request only high-value, low-quantity items. Revised: Offer 4 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore. My value: -68 +70 = +2. Minimal gain, but safe. Or 5 Sheep \u2192 3 Ore = +37 net gain. Better.\n\n[Expert B - Market Dynamics Strategist]  \nStep 3: Player 1 rejected a weak offer \u2014 they may have high Wheat or Wood. Try targeting Brick instead. Brick value is 28 \u2014 I have only 12. Offer: 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick. Value: -51 \u2192 +56 = +5. Small gain, high chance of acceptance.\n\n[Expert C - Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 3: I notice both Experts are converging on 3\u20135 Sheep for high-value goods. But after rejection, I must signal cooperation. I propose: Offer 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick. Feels balanced: 3 mid-value for 2 high-value. Opponent may feel they\u2019re getting mid-tier surplus; I get valuable Brick. Psychologically acceptable.\n\nConsensus Reached.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",

Optimal strategy: trade medium-value surplus (Sheep) for high-value Brick or Ore.  \n\n[Expert2: Game Theorist]  \nStep 1: I focus on strategic interaction. Player 1 rejected two offers for Sheep \u2192 3 Sheep for 2 Wheat/1 Wood, then 3 Sheep for 2 Brick.  \nFirst offer was poor: gave 3\u00d717 = 51 value for 2\u00d76 + 1\u00d710 = 22 \u2192 bad deal.  \nSecond offer: 51 out for 2\u00d728 = 56 \u2192 slight gain, but thin margin. Rejection suggests Player 1 demands better terms or hoards resources. Need to model Player 1\u2019s possible holdings and risk tolerance.\n\n[Expert3: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 1: I analyze perception and relationship. Player 0\u2019s first offer undervalued Sheep (giving them for low-value Wheat), making Player 1 suspicious. Second offer was better, but 3 Sheep for 2 Brick (51 \u2192 56) is minimal gain for Player 0, possibly seen as\u8bd5\u63a2 (probe), not serious. Player 1 may interpret this as low confidence. We must build trust while gaining value \u2014 offers should appear balanced, not exploitative.\n\n[Expert1: Economist]  \nStep 2: Identify optimal trade:  \n- Our marginal value of Sheep is 17; if Player 1 values Sheep higher (e.g., for development cards), we can exploit that.  \n- Brick at 28 is valuable; acquiring more increases total value rapidly.  \nIdeal: trade Sheep for Brick or Ore.  \nBut Ore (35) > Sheep (17) \u2192 hard to get directly.  \nAlternative: multi-resource bundles to appear fair.\n\n[Expert2: Game Theorist]  \nStep 2: Player 1\u2019s rejection implies either:  \n- They have excess Brick, so don\u2019t want to trade it.  \n- They lack Sheep but won\u2019t trade 1:1.  \n- They wait for better offers or to trade later.  \n\nBlind offers risk rejection. We should signal value preferences. A counterintuitive move: ask for Wood or Wheat in exchange for Sheep \u2014 but only if bundled to seem fair.\n\n[Expert3: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 2: We\u2019ve made two offers, both rejected. Player 1 feels no urgency. We need to shift perception. Instead of appearing desperate for Brick, frame an offer that suggests mutual gain.  \nExample: Offer Sheep + resource they may undervalue, request Brick. Or: request low-value items they might hoard (e.g., Wheat) in exchange for Sheep \u2014 counterintuitive but may succeed if framed as \u201chelping\u201d them.\n\n[Expert1: Economist]  \nStep 3: Let's calculate net value change:  \nCurrent total value:  \n(9\u00d76) + (17\u00d710) + (22\u00d717) + (12\u00d728) + (15\u00d735) =  \n54 + 170 + 374 + 336 + 525 = **1,459**\n\nWe want to increase this.  \nEven 1:1 Sheep \u2192 Brick is good: 17 cost \u2192 gain 28, net +11 per unit.  \nBut Player 1 won\u2019t do 1:1. Can we offer 2 Sheep for 3 Brick? Value: 34 \u2192 84? Too good for us, unlikely.  \nBetter: 2 Sheep + 1 Wood \u2192 2 Brick: we give 2\u00d717 + 10 = 44, get 56 \u2192 net +12. Possible.\n\n[Expert2: Game Theorist]  \nStep 3: Consider signaling. Previous offers were reactive. Now, make a slightly asymmetric but plausible offer to test Player 1\u2019s valuation.  \nI suggest: Offer **2 Sheep, 1 Wheat** for **2 Brick**.  \nValue to us: lose 2\u00d717 + 6 = 40, gain 56 \u2192 net +16.  \nTo Player 1: if they value Sheep highly (e.g., need 4 for a settlement), they may accept even at slight loss.  \n\nThis also hides our desire for high-value resources by including Wheat.\n\n[Expert3: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 3: The inclusion of Wheat makes the offer seem less predatory. \u201cI\u2019m cleaning my inventory\u201d is a better story than \u201cI want your Brick.\u201d Psychological principle: bundling with low-value items increases acceptance.  \nAlso, after two rejections, we must reset the tone. A small concession (adding Wheat) makes us seem flexible.\n\n**Consensus reached.**\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",

Giving up 2 Brick (25% of my current Brick) for 2 Sheep and 1 Wheat is not significantly altering my overall 'liquid' state in terms of quantities, but the value difference is negative.

      "response": "[Expert A: Resource Value Analyst]  \nStep 1: I analyze the intrinsic value of each resource based on Player 0's current inventory and values.  \n- Wheat: 6 \u2192 Low value, surplus (9)  \n- Wood: 10 \u2192 Low value, high surplus (17)  \n- Sheep: 17 \u2192 Medium value, very high surplus (22)  \n- Brick: 28 \u2192 High value, moderate stock (12)  \n- Ore: 35 \u2192 Very high value, decent stock (15)  \n\nOur goal is to increase total value. Since Brick and Ore are highest in value, acquiring more of them should be prioritized. We have excess Sheep and Wood, which are lowest in value-to-quantity ratio. Best strategy: trade excess Sheep/Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\n[Expert B: Negotiation Tactician]  \nStep 1: I examine recent trade attempts. Three offers made:  \n1. 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Wheat, 1 Wood (rejected) \u2013 poor: requested low-value items.  \n2. 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick (rejected) \u2013 better, but may undervalue 3 Sheep  \n3. 2 Sheep + 1 Wheat \u2192 2 Brick (rejected) \u2013 still not appealing to receiver  \n\nProblem: Player 1 may perceive these offers as unbalanced. We need to increase perceived fairness or add leverage. Perhaps bundle with less surplus items or request fewer in return.\n\n[Expert C: Market Equilibrium Strategist]  \nStep 1: I assess relative market value.  \n- 1 Sheep = 17 value  \n- 1 Brick = 28 value  \n\nSo 2 Sheep (34) \u2248 1.2 Brick. Therefore, 2 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick is favorable to *us*, not the other player. Player 1 should accept it\u2014yet they reject. Possible reasons:  \n- Player 1 has surplus Brick  \n- Player 1 values Sheep higher  \n- Player 1 doubts our intent or future trades  \nAlternatively, maybe our offers are too predictable or lack flexibility.\n\n[Expert A: Resource Value Analyst]  \nStep 2: Re-evaluating: Our Sheep surplus (22) means we can afford to trade them at a slight discount for high-value returns. But our repeated failure suggests misjudging the market. Brick is valuable (28), so trading 2 Sheep (34 total) for 2 Brick (56 total) gains us 22 value per trade. That\u2019s efficient.\n\nBut why reject? Either Player 1 has enough Brick, or we're not offering enough incentive. Perhaps shift focus to **Ore**, the highest value (35). We have 15 Ore\u2014could we *request* more Ore?\n\nBut we have no leverage unless we offer something Player 1 wants.\n\n[Expert B: Negotiation Tactician]  \nStep 2: I notice all offers only go to Player 1. No counter from Player 1\u2014suggests they\u2019re passive or waiting for better deal. Our last offer was 2 Sheep + 1 Wheat \u2192 2 Brick. Value:  \n- We give: 2\u00d717 + 1\u00d76 = 40  \n- We get: 2\u00d728 = 56  \nWe gain 16 net value. But from Player 1\u2019s view: they gain 40, pay 56 \u2014 loss of 16. Why would they accept?\n\nAh! **Critical error**: Our offers are favorable *to us*, but not to the other player. For a trade to succeed, it must appear mutually beneficial.\n\nWe need to offer less value than we request \u2014 or at least appear to balance it.\n\n[Expert C: Market Equilibrium Strategist]  \nStep 2: Recalculating fair exchange rates:  \n- 1 Brick (28) \u2248 1.65 Sheep (17\u00d71.65 \u2248 28)  \nSo 2 Brick \u2248 3.3 Sheep  \nWe offered **2 Sheep** for 2 Brick \u2192 that\u2019s a 1.3 Sheep deficit. We\u2019re asking for more than fair.\n\nEven offer 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick: 51 offered, 56 received \u2192 almost fair, but we still gain 5 net. Player 1 may still reject if they have better options.\n\nBest fair offer: 4 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick + 1 Wood (or similar add-on) to balance perception.\n\nBut we want to *increase* value, so we must *slightly* gain \u2014 but not obviously exploit.\n\n[Expert A: Resource Value Analyst]  \nStep 3: Update: Our previous offers were rational but misaligned with fairness perception. We must **frame** trades to appear balanced while still gaining long-term.\n\nOur highest surplus: Sheep (22). Best target: acquire Brick (28) or Ore (35).\n\nOre is most valuable. We have 15 \u2014 maybe Player 1 needs it. But we don\u2019t want to give away Ore.\n\nSo: **Offer combinations involving Sheep and Wood (low value to us) for Brick or Ore.**\n\nExample: 4 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore (value: 68 offered, 35 received) \u2014 no, that's terrible. We can't give more than we get.\n\nWait: We must **receive higher value** to increase total. So:\n\nOffer low-value items for high-value ones.\n\n- 2 Sheep (34) + 2 Wood (20) = 54 total value offered  \n- Request: 1 Ore (35) + 1 Brick (28) = 63 \u2192 we gain 9, they \"lose\" 9 \u2014 but if they have surplus, might accept.\n\nBut still unbalanced.\n\nBetter: 3 Sheep + 1 Wood = 51 \u2192 Request 1 Ore (35) + 1 Brick (28) = 63 \u2192 we gain 12.\n\nToo one-sided.\n\nFair trade: 2 Sheep + 3 Wood = 34 + 30 = 64 \u2192 Request 1 Ore (35) + 1 Brick (28) = 63. Almost equal. We gain 1. Acceptable.\n\n[Expert B: Negotiation Tactician]  \nStep 3: We need a trade that Player 1 can justify accepting. Let\u2019s assume Player 1 has different valuations or needs for development.\n\nBest approach: **Bundle a high-quantity, low-personal-value item (Sheep) with a low-value item (Wood) to request a high-value combo.**\n\nBut our prior attempts failed. So perhaps **request only one high-value item** with fair payment.\n\nTry: 4 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore  \n- We give: 4\u00d717 = 68  \n- We get: 35  \n\u2192 We lose 33! No. Not acceptable.\n\nWe can\u2019t trade down in value.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe **Brick is the best target**. It's high value (28), and we have a decent stock (12), but gaining more increases total value faster.\n\nFair rate: 1 Brick = 1.65 Sheep \u2192 so 2 Brick = ~3.3 Sheep.\n\nSo offer **4 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick**? Then we give 68, get 56 \u2014 we lose 12! Not good.\n\nBut earlier we offered less than fair and it failed.\n\nWait \u2014 contradiction.\n\n**Realization**: If 1 Sheep = 17 and 1 Brick = 28, then:\n\nTo gain value, we must receive more value than we give.\n\nSo only logical possibility: **the valuations are not shared**. Player 1 may value Brick lower, or Sheep higher.\n\nOr \u2014 **we are misunderstanding the goal**.\n\nGoal: *\"Increase the total value of your resources\"*\n\nSo we must end with higher \u2211(qty \u00d7 value) than now.\n\nCurrent total:  \n(9\u00d76) + (17\u00d710) + (22\u00d717) + (12\u00d728) + (15\u00d735) =  \n54 + 170 + 374 + 336 + 525 = **1,459**\n\nWe need to increase this.\n\nAny trade where value received > value given increases total.\n\nSo we must receive more value than we give.\n\nBut other players will only accept if they also gain, or at least don\u2019t lose much.\n\nSo **only possible if valuations differ**.\n\nBut in this game, do players use the same values?\n\nThe prompt says: *\"associated values you currently have\"* \u2014 implies *our* valuations may be private.\n\nAh! **Key insight**: Player 1 may have different values for resources.\n\nWe don\u2019t know their values. So we must **test**.\n\nOur previous offers assumed they value resources similarly \u2014 but maybe not.\n\nBest strategy: **Experiment with different offer types to infer Player 1's preferences.**\n\n[Expert C: Market Equilibrium Strategist]  \nStep 3: Yes! We must treat this as asymmetric information.\n\nWe need to probe Player 1\u2019s valuation.\n\nCurrent info:  \n- They rejected 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick: which gives them 51 value, costs 56 \u2014 small loss if values are same.  \n- They also rejected 2 Sheep + 1 Wheat \u2192 2 Brick: 34+6=40 for 56 \u2014 loss of 16.  \nBut maybe they *value Brick higher* than 28? Then they wouldn\u2019t trade it.\n\nOr \u2014 maybe they *value Sheep very highly*.\n\nAlternative: maybe they are waiting to see if we offer more.\n\nBut after three rejections, no counter \u2014 suggests they are not interested in Brick trades.\n\nAlternative idea: **Maybe Player 1 is low on Wood or Wheat?**\n\nWe have surplus Wood (17) and Wheat (9). Our values are low (10 and 6), but maybe Player 1 values them highly.\n\nSo reverse strategy: **Offer our high-supply, low-value items to get high-value returns, even if unusual.**\n\nTry: Bundle Wood, which we have 17 of (value 10), but maybe they need it.\n\nExample: Offer 5 Wood \u2192 Request 2 Ore.  \n- We give: 5\u00d710 = 50  \n- We get: 2\u00d735 = 70 \u2192 gain 20 \u2014 excellent if accepted.\n\nOr 5 Wood + 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick + 1 Ore \u2192 test willingness.\n\nBut we must increase chances of acceptance.\n\n[Expert B: Negotiation Tactician]  \nStep 4: New plan: Make an offer that appears balanced but favors us slightly, using less surplus per trade to reduce exposure.\n\nBut let's try a **different resource combo**.\n\nGiven that Sheep-only offers failed, try including **Wood**, which we also have in surplus.\n\nBest offer design:  \n- Target: Brick or Ore  \n- Offer: Mix of Sheep and Wood  \n- Request: 1 Ore or 2 Brick\n\nBut avoid overreach.\n\nTry: **3 Sheep + 2 Wood \u2192 2 Brick**\n\nValue:  \n- We give: 3\u00d717 + 2\u00d710 = 51 + 20 = 71  \n- We get: 2\u00d728 = 56 \u2192 we lose 15! No.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait \u2014 this is backwards.\n\nWe can\u2019t gain total value by giving more than we get.\n\nSo only viable trades are those where **value received > value given**.\n\nSo for 2 Brick (56), we must give less than 56 in our valuation.\n\nOptions:  \n- 3 Sheep = 51 \u2192 so 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick gives us 56 for 51 \u2014 gain 5. Acceptable.  \nBut we tried 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick and it was rejected.\n\nWhy? Because Player 1 may value 3 Sheep higher, or 2 Brick lower.\n\nOr they simply want more for 2 Brick.\n\nAlternate: **Request 1 Ore (35)**. Then we can give up to 34 in value.\n\nOptions:  \n- 2 Sheep = 34 \u2192 1 Ore = 35 \u2192 gain 1. Tiny, but valid.\n\nSo try: **2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore**\n\nValue: 34 given, 35 received \u2192 we gain 1.\n\nHigh chance of success only if Player 1 values Sheep < 17.5 or Ore \u2265 35.\n\nBut if they use same values, they lose 1 \u2014 might still accept for goodwill or surplus.\n\nBut no counteroffers \u2014 suggests they\u2019re not trading.\n\nAnother idea: maybe Player 1 has no interest in trading with us.\n\nBut we must keep trying.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe they want **Wheat**? We have 9, value 6.\n\nWe tried once with 1 Wheat bundled, failed.\n\nBut perhaps offer: **4 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick**\n\nWe give: 4\u00d76 = 24, get 28 \u2014 gain 4.\n\nWe have enough Wheat.\n\nBut would they want Wheat?\n\nUnlikely \u2014 but we can test.\n\nBut we need to **optimize**.\n\nBest **efficient gain** trades:\n\n1. 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick: gain 5 (56 - 51)  \n2. 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore: gain 1 (35 - 34)  \n3. 4 Wood \u2192 2 Brick: 40 given, 56 received \u2014 gain 16? Wait: 4\u00d710=40, 2\u00d728=56 \u2192 yes, gain 16  \n   - But we tried similar? No \u2014 we only tried Sheep offers.\n\nWe have **17 Wood** \u2014 can afford.\n\nOffer: **4 Wood \u2192 2 Brick**\n\n- We give: 40  \n- We get: 56  \n- Gain: 16\n\nBetter than Sheep offer.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t we try this?\n\nSimilarly, **5 Wood \u2192 1 Ore**: 50 given, 35 received \u2014 loss 15 \u2192 no.\n\nSo **4 Wood \u2192 2 Brick** is best so far.\n\nBut Player 1 may value Brick higher.\n\nStill, worth testing.\n\nBut we tried 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick (us gain 5), which was rejected.\n\nNow offering 4 Wood \u2192 2 Brick (us gain 16) \u2014 but we give 40, get 56.\n\nBut if they value Wood at 10 and Brick at 28, they lose 16 \u2014 worse for them.\n\nSo less likely to accept than 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick.\n\nParadox: better deal *for us* is worse deal *for them* \u2192 less likely to accept.\n\nSo we need a **mutually beneficial appearance**, even if not perfectly balanced.\n\nBest shot: **3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick** \u2014 we gain 5, they \"lose\" 5, but maybe they have excess Sheep.\n\nBut rejected.\n\nUnless we add something small.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe they want **variety** or **liquidity**.\n\nAlternative: make an offer requesting **1 Brick and 1 Wood** in exchange for **2 Sheep**?\n\nNo \u2014 we have surplus Wood.\n\nWe don\u2019t want more Wood.\n\nUnless for re-trade, but only one player.\n\nSo no.\n\n[Expert A: Resource Value Analyst]  \nStep 4: Final realization: We have been offering for Brick, but maybe **Ore is easier to get**.\n\nTry: **3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore**\n\n- We give: 51, get 35 \u2192 we lose 16!

I have a lot of Sheep (17) and a decent amount of Wood (10). Ore and Brick are high-value resources for me, and I have a good quantity of Ore (14) but moderate Brick (8). Giving away Ore and Brick, even for a slight value gain, might deplete my high-value resources. However, if my opponent desperately needs them, I might extract more later.\n\n**VM - Step 1:** The current offer from Player 0 is 'Offered: 3 Sheep, 1 Wood -> Requested: 1 Ore, 1 Brick'.\nValue of items offered by Player 0 (to me): (3 * 16) + (1 * 12) = 48 + 12 = 60.\nValue of items requested by Player 0 (from me): (1 * 32) + (1 * 26) = 32 + 26 = 58.\nThis trade yields a net value increase of 60 - 58 = +2 for me.\n\n**MA - Step 1:** Player 0 has consistently been offering Sheep and sometimes Wood, and consistently requesting Brick, and now Ore. This suggests Player 0 is resource-rich in Sheep/Wood and resource-poor/needs Brick/Ore for their objectives. This patterns implies they value Brick/Ore highly, which means I might be able to get a better deal for them. The previous offers show P0 is slowly escalating what they offer for my high-value resources.\n\n### My Decision based on Experts' first steps:\n\nThe VM clearly states a +2 value gain. The MA suggests Player 0 wants Brick/Ore badly, implying I might get more. The RS highlights the risk of depleting high-value resources, but also the potential for exploiting P0's need.\n\nWhile a +2 gain is positive, the consistent pattern from Player 0 suggests they are willing to overpay for Brick and Ore. I still have 8 Brick and 14 Ore, so giving up 1 of each (especially Ore) without a substantial gain now might not be optimal if their desperation builds. Given past offers, a +2 isn't a significant enough margin to deplete one of my highest value resources (Ore). I believe I can get a better offer.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "[Expert1] I am a Resource Value Strategist. I analyze intrinsic resource values and long-term value growth. My focus is on maximizing total portfolio value over time. Current value of Player 0's resources:  \n(9 \u00d7 6) + (17 \u00d7 10) + (22 \u00d7 17) + (12 \u00d7 28) + (15 \u00d7 35) = 54 + 170 + 374 + 336 + 525 = **1,459**  \nWe must increase this total. Ore and Brick have the highest values (35 and 28), so acquiring more of these is ideal. Sheep, while moderately valuable (17), are in surplus (22). Trading Sheep for Ore or Brick offers positive expected value.\n\n[Expert2] I am a Behavioral Trade Analyst. I observe patterns in Player 1's behavior. Player 1 has rejected four consecutive offers from Player 0, all involving Sheep as the offered resource\u2014especially bundles with Sheep and low-value extras (Wheat, Wood). Even the offer of 3 Sheep for just 2 Brick was rejected, which is a slight value gain (51 \u2192 56) for us but possibly too aggressive (33% markup). Player 1 may perceive these as unfair or may lack interest in Sheep. We may need to adjust our offer profile or target different resources.\n\n[Expert3] I am a Market Equilibrium Expert. I evaluate fair exchange ratios based on resource value. Let's compute fair trades:  \n- 1 Brick = 28 value \u2192 equivalent to 28/17 \u2248 1.65 Sheep  \n- 1 Ore = 35 \u2192 \u2248 2.06 Sheep  \nThus, fair trades:\n- 2 Sheep \u2248 1 Brick + small premium  \n- 3 Sheep \u2248 1 Ore + 1 Brick (total value: 51 \u2192 63) is highly favorable for us, but requires perceived balance.  \nOur last offer (3 Sheep + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore + 1 Brick) has value: offered 51 + 10 = 61, requested 35 + 28 = 63. Almost fair, but Player 1 may not want Wood. Perhaps we should drop Wood and improve value perception.\n\n[Expert1] Given the high value of Ore, I now recommend targeting Ore directly. We should offer 2 Sheep (34 value) for 1 Ore (35 value) \u2014 a nearly one-to-one trade but net +1 value. Alternatively, 3 Sheep (51) for 1 Ore and 1 Brick (63) is excellent, but only if Player 1 values Sheep highly. Since Player 1 keeps rejecting, perhaps they don\u2019t need Sheep. We may need to probe with different resources.\n\n[Expert2] Player 1 hasn't made a counteroffer, suggesting disengagement or strong aversion to current offers. Offering Wood \u2014 a low-value (10), high-quantity (17) resource \u2014 might be more enticing as a sweetener than extra Sheep. Alternatively, Player 1 might value Wheat or Brick scarcity. But since we have plenty of Sheep and Wood, combining them strategically could trigger acceptance.\n\n[Expert3] I notice our offers are close to fair but may feel \"pushy\" due to high-value returns. Let\u2019s simulate a more balanced offer: 2 Sheep + 1 Wood (34 + 10 = 44 value) for 1 Brick (28) and 1 Wheat (6) \u2014 we'd lose value (44 \u2192 34), so bad. Instead: 3 Sheep (51) \u2192 1 Ore (35) + 1 Wheat (6) = 41 \u2014 we gain 10 value, they get 51 for 41, so unlikely. Wait \u2014 perhaps we should offer Wood for Ore directly? 2 Wood (20) for 1 Ore (35)? Too good for us \u2014 Player 1 won\u2019t accept. Need to stay near market fairness.\n\n[Expert1] I revise strategy: since we have 22 Sheep (highest quantity), we can afford to use them as currency. But if Player 1 doesn\u2019t want Sheep, we should pivot. We have 17 Wood \u2014 second highest quantity. Value is low (10), but might be useful to someone. Consider offering 4 Wood (40 value) for 1 Ore (35) \u2014 slightly overpaying, but clears excess. Or 2 Wood + 2 Sheep (20 + 34 = 54) for 1 Ore + 1 Brick (63) \u2014 strong gain (+9). That trade has better balance and uses two resource types, possibly more appealing.\n\n[Expert2] I see a pattern: all rejections involve offers from us with only Sheep or Sheep + one other. Player 1 might prefer trades where they give less or receive more variety. Also, Player 1 may be waiting for us to accept an offer \u2014 but none have been made. We should consider waiting or signaling openness. However, with 6 turns left, we must act.\n\n[Expert3] Final calculation: the most efficient value gain is trading low-value-high-quantity for high-value-low-quantity. We are rich in Sheep and Wood. Ore is most valuable (35), then Brick (28). Best bet: offer 2 Sheep and 2 Wood (34 + 20 = 54) for 1 Ore and 1 Brick (63). Net gain +9 value. The offer looks balanced, uses two of our surpluses, and gives Player 1 five resources for two \u2014 which may feel like a win.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",

Not worth it.  \nBest bet: replicate prior success, but test slight improvement:  \n**3 Sheep, 2 Wood \u2192 1 Ore, 2 Brick**  \nCost: 51 + 20 = 71, Gain: 35 + 56 = 91 \u2192 Net +20, Efficiency: 1.28  \nStill modest gain but better than before.  \n\n---\n\n[Expert A - Resource Valuation Specialist]  \nStep 3: Approve target trade if it reduces surplus and boosts high-value holdings.  \nWe still have 20 Sheep and 15 Wood \u2014 well above average utility.  \nOre and Brick remain highest value (35 and 28).  \nEven small gains in Ore/Brick are beneficial if we maintain surplus in Sheep/Wood.  \nTrade **3 Sheep, 2 Wood \u2192 1 Ore, 2 Brick** shifts 71 value to 91 \u2014 strong upgrade.  \nApprove.  \n\n[Expert B - Behavioral Negotiation Strategist]  \nStep 3: Refine offer format to mirror previous successful structure.  \nLast accepted offer was symmetric: 2/2 \u2192 1/1.  \nThis offer is asymmetric: 3/2 \u2192 1/2. Risky \u2014 Player 1 may distrust imbalance.  \nBetter: **2 Sheep, 2 Wood \u2192 1 Ore, 1 Brick** again? But we already know that works.  \nBut Player may tire of same offer. Alternatively, **2 Sheep, 3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore, 1 Brick**? No \u2014 we\u2019d be offering more.  \nOr flip: **1 Sheep, 2 Wood \u2192 1 Brick**? Too small.  \nBest: Slightly sweeter deal \u2014 **3 Sheep, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Ore, 2 Brick** \u2014 full symmetry.  \nMimics success, scales up, fair appearance.  \nLikely to be seen as \"more of a good deal\" rather than aggressive.  \n\n[Expert C - Trade Efficiency Analyst]  \nStep 3: Validate scalability.  \nOffer: 3 Sheep, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Ore, 2 Brick  \n- Cost: 3\u00d717 + 3\u00d710 = 51 + 30 = 81  \n- Gain: 2\u00d735 + 2\u00d728 = 70 + 56 = 126  \n- Net: +45, Efficiency: 1.56  \nSignificant improvement over prior +9.  \nEven if rejected, we can fall back to previous.  \nMarginal value per Sheep decreases as we hold fewer, but 20 \u2192 17 still leaves surplus.  \n\nAll three experts agree: This is the optimal path.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore, 2 Brick]",
