Stockpiler (\u201cStability-Seeker\u201d): hoards the resource-types he thinks will be scarce next turn.  \n3.  Opportunist (\u201cSwap-Master\u201d): looks for one-sided trades\u2014where he can convert large numbers of low-value excess into just enough of a scarcer, high-value good without hurting the opponent\u2019s feelings.\n\nAll three will speak once per step before moving to the next.\n\n=======\nSTEP 1  (Turn-clock at 1 of 10)\n=======\nProfit-Seeker: My spreadsheet shows marginal values per unit:\n Wheat 6/8 \u2248 0.75  \n Wood 8/6 \u2248 1.33  \n Sheep 14/9 \u2248 1.56  \n Brick 24/8 = 3.00  \n Ore   38/5 = 7.60  \n\n The worst performer is Wheat; Brick & Ore dominate on the high end.  \n I want to dump Wheat first and am willing to overpay slightly in Wheat to get Ore.\n\nStability-Seeker: Brick already has high value, and I\u2019m sitting on 8\u2014the threshold where scarcity usually flips. If other players are low on Brick, its marginal value will rise over the next 9 turns. I need to keep at least 7 Brick and target Ore on top.\n\nSwap-Master: I have 8 Wheat at embarrassingly low value. Bricks are 3 value each; I think I can get 2 Bricks for 4 Wheat on the open market right now (giving 2-value surplus to opponent but gaining me 6 value in the swap: 4\u00d70.75 \u2192 2\u00d73), netting me a 4-value gain with virtually no risk.\n\n=======\nSTEP 2\n=======\nProfit-Seeker: Combined with Swap-Master\u2019s idea, I\u2019d modify the proposal: offer 4 Wheat for 2 Brick.

Agree with the 4 Wheat \u2192 2 Brick trade.\n\nSwap-Master: The other players hate uneven swaps though. To sweeten without losing edge, I double the Wheat: **[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 1 Sheep]**.\n\nBreakdown:\n \u2022 8\u00d70.75 = 6 value out.  \n \u2022 3\u00d73 + 1\u00d71.56 \u2248 10.68 value in.  \n Net \u2248 4.68 value gained.

The experts analyze from value-based, resource-based, and bargaining perspectives. \n\n### Expert 1: Value Maximizer\n- **Step 1:** \"Player 0's offer gives us a net value loss. We gain 8 Wheat (8 \u00d7 6 = 48 value) but lose 3 Brick (3 \u00d7 30 = 90) and 1 Sheep (1 \u00d7 18 = 18), so net change is 48 - 108 = -60. Reject this to avoid value destruction.\"\n- **Step 2:** \"To increase value, counter-propose a trade where we give low-value resources for high-value ones. Specifically, offer 10 Wheat (10 \u00d7 6 = 60 value loss) for 2 Ore (2 \u00d7 36 = 72 value gain), yielding a net +12 gain. This leverages our excess Wheat for high-value Ore.\"\n- **Step 3:** \"If Player 0 rejects, we can adjust ratios later. The key is to start with a value-positive offer to force negotiation in our favor.\"\n\n### Expert 2: Resource Manager\n- **Step 1:** \"We have ample Wheat (14) and Wood (21) but lower quantities of high-value Brick (20) and Ore (17). Accepting Player 0's offer risks depleting Brick and Sheep unnecessarily, while worsening our stock balance. Deny to protect key resources.\"\n- **Step 2:** \"Trading 10 Wheat reduces our Wheat to 4, but Wheat is low-value and non-critical. Ore is scarce and high-value\u2014prioritize acquiring more. The counter-offer 10 Wheat for 2 Ore is sensible: it trims excess inventory while boosting value and maintaining flexibility.\"\n- **Step 3:** \"Long-term, we should focus on acquiring Ore or Brick through similar asymmetric trades. Wood (value 11) is also disposable for negotiation, but Wheat should be offloaded first.\"\n\n### Expert 3: Bargaining Strategist\n- **Step 1:** \"Player 0's offer signals they value Brick and Sheep over Wheat. They may have a Wheat surplus. Reject this aggressive opening, but exploit their preferences by countering with a win-win: offer Wheat for their high-value resources.\"\n- **Step 2:** \"Propose 10 Wheat for 2 Ore\u2014reasonable given values. If that fails, we could request Brick instead. Avoid offering Sheep or Brick ourselves, as they are valuable to both sides. Testing 10 Wheat for 2 Ore sets a good anchor.\"\n- **Step 3:** \"Build rapport; this is the first turn of 10. If rejected, vary offers (e.g., add Wood to deals) to find mutual benefits. But starting simple with Wheat\u2013Ore optimizes upside.\"\n\n### Decision\nAll experts agree: Deny Player 0's offer and counter-propose **10 Wheat for 2 Ore** to secure a +12 net value gain while using excess resources. If Player 0 rejects, future turns can refine offers.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",

Giving up 2 Ore = \u221238 value but getting 10 Wheat would only add 7.5 value \u2013 a whopping \u201330.5 net \u2013 absurdly negative. Should auto-deny.\n\nExpert 2 \u2013 \"Scarcity Connoisseur\" \u2013 specialises in spotting over-supply and bottlenecks in Catan\u2010style end-game scenarios.  \nStep-1: scans Player 0\u2019s inventory for obvious glut/shortage. 9 Sheep (value 14) is already the second lowest value-locked stock. Brick (value 24) is the scarcer building block and Ore (38) the rarest. Any offer that further dilutes Ore or Brick is probably bad. The latent surplus of Sheep means they\u2019re excellent \u201cgive-away\u201d material without hurting end-game scoring.\n\nExpert 3 \u2013 \"Combo-Builder\" \u2013 loves to craft dual-turn plans that convert current excesses into sets that maximise near-term build potential.  \nStep-1: calculates what precise trades will let Player 0 make optimal builds. Currently holds 8 Brick + 5 Ore, enough for a city (or bank Ore-Bank trade) if more Ore can be pocketed. A single additional Ore is worth more to Player 0 than any amount of Wheat. Their Sheep surplus could be bundled to sweeten other deals.\n\nNow the Board resets per rule: on Step-2 all experts continue.\n\nStep-2\nExpert 1: \u201cThe only strictly +EV path left is flipping the two-types-of-brick-for-three-type-wheat imbalance around. Suggest offering 3 Sheep (value 14/9 \u2248 1.56 each) and 2 Ore (value 38/5 = 7.6 each) = 18.8 total outgoing, for 5 Brick + 2 Sheep. The 5 Brick (15 value) plus retained 2 Sheep (3.1) = 18.1 value \u2013 essentially flat AND it improves distribution. Net micro-profit: \u22120.7 but\u03b5-close to breakeven. Acceptable only if turn clock forces the reshuffle soon.\u201d  \n\u2192 Expert 1 recommends making that offer one-time.\n\nExpert 2: \u201cAgrees with above because Sheep are piling up. Down-trading Sheep keeps scarcity of Brick intact.\u201d  \nExpert 3: \u201cLikes it; the deal pushes Player 0 up to 13 Brick / 3 Ore, nearly city-ready. Failsafe against the looming Brick runout.\u201d  \n\nStep-3 (all converged) \u2013 no expert realised an error, so they form consensus.\n\nAction produced by consensus:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]",

They may need Brick urgently. Deny to exploit their demand later.\"  \n\nAll experts remain; no one leaves.\n\n### Step 2: Counter-Offering Considerations\n- **VM:** \"Deny their offer.

Try 8 Wheat (48) and 3 Wood (33, total offered=81) for 2 Ore (72): immediate +4 net gain (81 cost vs. 72 return).\"\n- **RB:** \"VM's logic holds. Wheat (14) and Wood (21) are excessive\u2014perfect for dumping. But Sheep is better currency: we have 20, and Player 0\u2019s Sheep inclusion hints they undervalue it.

Avoid Sheep counters; Player 0 may not want it.\"  \n\nRB proposes a higher-value Sheep trade, but ST notes risk; all experts remain.\n\n### Step 3: Consensus on Action\n- **VM:** \"3 Sheep for 2 Ore (+18) is superior to VM/WRB mixed trades (+4, smaller gain). ST\u2019s Brick-for-Ore (+6) is weaker. Sheep trade optimizes value with abundant stock.\"\n- **RB:** \"Agree with VM: Sheep trade preserves Brick for urgent deals but sacrifices expendable Sheep.

They do not appear starved for Ore.\n\nSupply-Chain Negotiator: Brick is the limiting resource.

Our resources post-trade: Sheep (+1), Wood (+2), Brick (-5). Value calculation: We give 186 points (5 Brick \u00d7 30 + 2 Sheep \u00d7 18) and get 76 points (3 Sheep \u00d7 18 + 2 Wood \u00d7 11). This trade is unacceptable\u2014it directly opposes our goal of increasing value.\"\n\n### Expert 2 (Strategic Trader)\n- \"Player 0 clearly wants Brick and Sheep, but their offer devalues our high-value Brick (30 each) for low-return resources. We should counter by trading our surplus Sheep (20) for higher-value resources. Player 0 has consistently offered Wood, indicating a surplus. Propose 2 Sheep \u2192 5 Wood: Sheep values at 18 each, Wood at 11 each. Net value gain: +19 (55 received vs. 36 given). This upgrades our portfolio without sacrificing critical resources.\"\n\n### Expert 3 (Opponent Modeler)\n- \"Player 0\u2019s pattern reveals desperation for Brick and Sheep, likely for game objectives (e.g., building in Catan). They substituted Wood for Ore in their last offer, signaling Ore scarcity. Exploit this by offering Sheep for their abundant Wood. Our 2 Sheep \u2192 5 Wood trade is attractive to them while yielding us a +19 value gain. Avoid Ore-focused deals\u2014they\u2019ve rejected those before and may not have enough.\"\n\n### Consensus\n- Reject Player 0\u2019s current offer due to significant value loss (-110).  \n- Counter with **[Offer: 2 Sheep \u2192 5 Wood]** for a confirmed value gain (+19) using Player 0\u2019s Wood surplus against their Sheep demand.\n\n**Player 1's action:**  \n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 5 Wood]",

My rule-of-thumb: never give up 1 value without receiving \u22651.5 value.  \n   \u2013 The 3 Sheep+2 Ore bid I\u2019ve kept repeating (5 Brick+2 Sheep) nets me **5\u00d724+2\u00d714 = 148 for giving 3\u00d714+2\u00d738 = 118 \u2192 gain +30 value (~25% surplus)** yet keeps coming back *rejected*. The mathematical edge is there, but Player 1 clearly won\u2019t bite.\n\n**Rodney:**  \n- Player 1 has already refused that same offer *three* times (plus once swapping Ore\u2192Wood variant). Psychological data say \u201csheep+ore-for-brick\u201d pattern is now *anchored negatively*.  \n- Insisting builds stubbornness, not trust. We must break the pattern or sweeten it.\n\n**Sybil:**  \n- Repeated rejections hint at either a Brick famine **or** a Sheep/Ore glut **in Player 1\u2019s hand**.  \n- In other words, the issue could be *fit*, not *value*. Brick simply appears to be Player 1\u2019s chokepoint\u2014he hoards it.\n\n#### \u27a4 Step 2 \u2013 Candidate New Approaches  \n**Percy:**  \n- Surplus Wheat (48 value) is least efficient. Let\u2019s *sell* more Wheat.  \n- Compare: 1 Ore (38) vs 5 Wheat (30). Trading my Ore away is suicide. Trading Wheat away for anything else \u22655-for-1 is profit.  \n- Offer **8 Wheat for 3 Brick** again? Actually *lower value* than I had open-above (8\u00d76 =48 vs gaining 3\u00d724+14 =86). Risk: I asked this once and got rejected.  \n\n**Rodney:**  \n- The Veil is down; Brick is sacred. Let me *probe with a sharper, low-resource watertight mini-offer* first:  \n   \u2013 Give up only **2 Sheep = 28 value** \u2192 ask **3 Brick = 72 value**. 72-28 = +44 value leap.  \n   \u2013 Trim the fear-factor for Player 1; 3 Brick but only 2 Sheep given\u2014their \u201ctoilet paper cost\u201d drops.  \n\n**Sybil:**  \n- A single 2-for-3 trade can snowball later. But if Player 1 dithers, we then escalate to 3-for-4, etc. Let\u2019s test now.\n\n#### \u27a4 Step 3 \u2013 Synthesize and Execute  \n**Consensus:**  \nCollective weight tilts to Rodney\u2019s mini-offer as the lowest-friction test. If refused, we pivot back to Wheat-dumping with larger margins on turn 8.  \n\nPercy double-checks:  \n\u201cGive: 2 Sheep (28) \u2192 Get: 3 Brick (72).

      "response": "In this Negotiation Game, as Player 1, I have assembled three virtual trading experts to advise on maximizing the total value of my resources. The experts represent different perspectives: a **Value Maximizer** (focused strictly on net value change), a **Resource Balancer** (focused on quantity adjustments and long-term resource utility), and a **Strategic Trader** (focused on opponent behavior and game dynamics). After analyzing the current offer from Player 0 (Offered: 2 Sheep \u2192 Requested: 3 Brick) and our resource situation (Wheat:14, Wood:21, Sheep:20, Brick:20, Ore:17), the experts engage in a structured three-step discussion. If any expert \"leaves,\" it means they no longer contribute due to realizing their initial view is flawed.\n\n### Expert Discussion:\n**Step 1: Initial Analysis**\n- **Value Maximizer**: \"This trade gives us 2 Sheep (value: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36) for 3 Brick (value: 3 \u00d7 30 = 90). Net value loss: 54. We should deny it to avoid decreasing our total value. Brick\u2019s high value (30) makes it too costly to trade for lower-value Sheep (18).\"\n- **Resource Balancer**: \"We have ample Brick (20) but Sheep is also abundant (20). Giving 3 Brick reduces it to 17 (still healthy), but receiving Sheep increases it to 22\u2014risk of hoarding a low-value resource. No strategic benefit, so deny. We should prioritize jettisoning Wheat or Wood instead.\"\n- **Strategic Trader**: \"Player 0 keeps pushing for Brick (e.g., similar offers in history), signaling high demand. But they undervalue Sheep\u2014no gain here. Ore is key (value: 36), yet Player 0 refused our past Ore requests. Deny and pivot to probe their Ore supply.\"\n\n**Step 2: Consolidation**\n- **Value Maximizer**: \"Staunchly against the offer\u2014net loss confirmed. Focus on trades with positive net value, e.g., offering Wood (11) for Ore (36). Still active.\"\n- **Resource Balancer**: \"Agreed: pointless to accumulate excess Sheep. We have Wheat (14) and Wood (21) at low values\u2014ideal to offload for Ore. Strategic Trader\u2019s Ore focus could help rebalance. Still active.\"\n- **Strategic Trader**: \"Player 0\u2019s rejections of Ore-centric offers (e.g., our past Wheat\u2192Ore) imply they hoard Ore. But their Sheep-heavy offers suggest bargaining power lies elsewhere\u2014manage Brick cautiously. Deny and counter with Wood for Ore (new angle!). Still active.\"\n\n**Step 3: Counter-Offer Proposal**\n- **Value Maximizer**: \"Offer Wood: low value (11) vs. Ore\u2019s high value (36). Ideal: 3 Wood (loss: 33) for 1 Ore (gain: 36), net +3 value. Avoid Wheat\u2014Player 0 dismisses it, per history.\"  \n- **Resource Balancer**: \"Support! Wood is plentiful (21) at moderate value; reducing to 18 is sustainable. Ore acquisition (to 18) bulks high-value reserves. A modest ask (1 Ore) might tempt Player 0.\"\n- **Strategic Trader**: \"Smart shift! Wood hasn\u2019t been tested in offers to Player 0. Their ore hoarding requires pressure\u2014score a small win here. If rejected, we persist; Brick leverage remains. All agree.\"\n\n**Consensus**: Deny Player 0\u2019s offer (net loss, no resource benefit) and counter with 3 Wood for 1 Ore (net value gain, strategic resource shift).\n\n### Player 1's Action:\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

Net gain \u2248 +3.9. This is unlikely to be refused.\u201d\n\n#### Expert B \u2013 Risk-oriented Trader\n\u201cOpponent has been stingy with Brick so they\u2019re probably short. Giving them three low-value Wheat instead of Sheep keeps our high-value Ore, Brick, Sheep intact. Offer 3 Wheat (value 2.25) for 1 Brick (value 3). It\u2019s small but positive (+0.75) and conserves all scarce resources.\u201d\n\n#### Expert C \u2013 Strategic Yields Analyst\n\u201cWe currently hold the *entire* stock of Brick (8 units out of 8). That monopoly is worth something. Rather than trade any Brick away, let\u2019s exploit it to get the last Ore we crave. Offer *4 Sheep* (value 6.22) for 1 Ore (7.6). Net = +1.38 and still leaves 5 Sheep.\u201d\n\nAll three agree on one *actionable* offer above: Expert A\u2019s 5 Wheat for 1 Ore.  \nWe transmit that now.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
