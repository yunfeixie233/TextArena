      "response": "**Expert A: Value Maximizer**  \n*Step 1:* I analyze the current resources and their values. I notice that Ore has the highest value at 34, and Brick is a valuable resource for trade as well. The goal is to acquire more high-value resources. I will propose an offer that trades lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n**Expert B: Risk Management**  \n*Step 1:* It's important to minimize risk while maximizing trade value. I notice that Wheat and Wood have lower value compared to other resources. The focus should be on holding on to Ore and Brick while trading the resources that will not drastically reduce the current stock. \n\n**Expert C: Market Analyst**  \n*Step 1:* I study potential market behaviors and available trades among players. Establishing alliances or strong trades can lead to higher future value. Noticing some players often need Brick, I suggest finding ways to trade for more resources of greater value without losing too much for myself.\n\n---\n\n**Expert A: Value Maximizer**  \n*Step 2:* After analyzing the need for Brick among other players, I will propose:  \n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]  \n\n**Expert B: Risk Management**  \n*Step 2:* Before accepting or denying, I should ensure that I\u2019m not giving up too much Ore, which is high value. I evaluate the proposal and feel it's worth denying at this moment. I\u2019ll wait for more advantageous offers.  \n[Denounce]\n\n**Expert C: Market Analyst**  \n*Step 2:* Seeing the proposal from Expert A, I assess whether we can facilitate a trade with others without harming our resource wealth. I deny it for now, but I plan to initiate trades with those who need Sheep.  \n[Denounce]\n\n---\n\n**Expert A: Value Maximizer**  \n*Step 3:* Since the last proposal was denied, it\u2019s time to pivot to trading some Wheat as it has lower value. I will propose:  \n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]  \n\n**Expert B: Risk Management**  \n*Step 3:* With this new proposal being more balanced, I re-evaluate Wheat's trade risk. Accepting a trade that positions me for more valuable resources could work in my favor.  \n[Accept]\n\n**Expert C: Market Analyst**  \n*Step 3:* The proposal from Expert A looks profitable. The additional resources could further increase our value. I\u2019ll support it as well.  \n[Accept]\n\n---\n\n**Expert A: Value Maximizer**  \n*Step 4:* The offer was accepted successfully, boosting our Brick and Ore count. To further maximize value, I\u2019ll propose the following:  \n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 4 Ore]  \n\n**Expert B: Risk Management**  \n*Step 4:* Since keeping high-value resources is critical, I\u2019ll be cautious here. While gaining Ore is attractive, I need to ensure not to overexpose my Sheep stock. I decide to deny.  \n[Denounce]\n\n**Expert C: Market Analyst**  \n*Step 4:* I see the value in acquiring more Ore, however, given that Expert B will deny, I will too. At this stage, we should focus on alternatives to negotiate better.  \n[Denounce]\n\n---\n\n**Expert A: Value Maximizer**  \n*Step 5:* Since there\u2019s a clear unwillingness to trade for Ore, I will switch my focus to Sheep, which may be easier for others to part with for what we need. I propose:  \n[Offer: 6 Sheep -> 3 Wheat]  \n\n**Expert B: Risk Management**  \n*Step 5:* I consider the need for Wheat again. Leveraging a larger quantity may risk my own stock too heavily; I\u2019ll consider this offer cautiously.  \n[Denounce]\n\n**Expert C: Market Analyst**  \n*Step 5:* I evaluate the market demand. I think this move could yield better resources. Upon analysis, I\u2019ll accept this for a better advantage.  \n[Accept]  \n\n---\n\n**Expert A: Value Maximizer**  \n*Step 6:* The trade was successful, converting Sheep for more Wheat. I will now propose a different strategy focused on retaining our gained resources:  \n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]  \n\n**Expert B: Risk Management**  \n*Step 6:* I consider that we have just increased our Wheat, but Brick remains critical \u2014 accepting this trades away our leverage. I will deny this offer.  \n[Denounce]\n\n**Expert C: Market Analyst**  \n*Step 6:* My focus will be on gaining advantage from this trade as well. After assessing the benefits, I will also deny. We're still looking for better opportunities.  \n[Denounce]\n\n---\n\nTo summarize up to **Turn 6**, resources have been traded strategically with the focus on ensuring value increases. Continuing forward, I will adapt strategies based on feedback and evolving trading conditions.

Losing 5 reduces flexibility in future brick-based trades or builds.  \nOre is highest value (33), so gaining 2 is good, but only if it doesn\u2019t cost disproportionately.  \nSheep only increases by 1 (from 9 to 10), minimal gain.  \nMore concerning: this trade gives away 5 Brick for only 2 Ore and a net +1 Sheep \u2014 weak return. Could I trade those 5 Brick better later? Likely yes.  \nAlso, trading Sheep back (2 given) suggests circular movement \u2014 possibly wasteful.\n\n[Expert 2: Trade Efficiency Analyst]  \nStep 2: Confirming calculation \u2014 net value loss is significant (-57). This trade reduces total value. I conclude: **do not accept**.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 2: Given the above, I recalculate post-trade value:  \n- Brick: 18 - 5 = 13 \u2192 13 \u00d7 27 = 351 (-135)  \n- Ore: 17 + 2 = 19 \u2192 19 \u00d7 33 = 627 (+66)  \n- Sheep: 9 + 3 - 2 = 10 \u2192 10 \u00d7 12 = 120 (+12)  \nOthers unchanged.  \nNew total: 102 + 264 + 120 + 351 + 627 = **1,464**  \nDown from 1,521 \u2192 loss of **57**  \nTherefore, the trade destroys value.\n\n[Expert 3: Opportunity Cost & Future Flexibility Expert]  \nStep 2: I assess alternative uses. With 18 Brick, I already have strong positioning. Trading 5 now for minimal gain harms future negotiation leverage. Also, Ore is valuable, but 2 Ore for 5 Brick is poor rate \u2014 I could likely obtain 2 Ore for fewer Brick later.  \nMoreover, Player 0 is effectively laundering Sheep \u2014 giving 3, getting back 2 \u2014 possibly hiding intent or manipulating counts.

The value of Brick is lower compared to Ore and Sheep. Since Player 1 rejected my last offer, I should consider what resources they might be seeking and how I can optimize my trades based on my surplus.\n2. **Next Step:** I will offer another trade to Player 1 that maximizes the value of resources I am willing to give away while also being attractive for them to accept.\n\n   **Offer:** \n   - [Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 5 Brick, 2 Ore]\n\n### Expert 2: Market Analyst\n1. **Analysis Step:** The market dynamics suggest that Brick is in demand for several different potential trades.

I need to assess my offers to create a pull effect where my suggested trade fills a gap in their resources.\n2. **Next Step:** To stimulate Player 1 to engage in trading, I will construct an offer that directly appeals to the market demand around Brick and possibly adds another sought-after resource.\n\n   **Offer:**\n   - [Offer: 2 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Ore]\n\n### Expert 3: Risk Manager\n1. **Analysis Step:** The previous trade proposal was rejected, indicating that my current offering may not be well-aligned with Player 1's strategy or needs.

But is it too good? Might be a mistake or bluff.\n\n[Expert 3: Risk & Psychology Advisor]  \nStep 1: I analyze opponent intent. Player 0 first offered:  \n3 Sheep + 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 2 Sheep (net: +3 Brick, -1 Sheep, -2 Ore)  \nThat was slightly in their favor.  \nNow they offer: 4 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 5 Brick + 2 Ore (net: +5 Brick, +2 Ore, -4 Wheat, -3 Wood)  \nThis is *massively* in our favor. Either they miscalculated, are desperate, or testing us. Caution: too-good offers often hide traps.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 2: Re-evaluating our needs. We have high Brick (18) and Ore (17), moderate Wheat and Wood, lower Sheep (9).  \nWood (22) is high, but Wood is medium value. Brick and Ore are high-value\u2014we may want to *trade down* from them only for large gains.  \nGiving up 5 Brick and 2 Ore (201 value) for 4 Wheat (24) and 3 Wood (36) = 60 total is terrible for us. But wait\u2014Player 0 is *offering* us 4 Wheat and 3 Wood *to get* 5 Brick and 2 Ore? No\u2014  \nWait: the offer is:  \n**Player 0 offers us** 4 Wheat + 3 Wood  \n**in exchange for** 5 Brick + 2 Ore  \nSo *they* give us 60 value, *we* give them 201 value.  \nThat\u2019s a loss of 141 value for us.  \nThat\u2019s a terrible deal. We should **not** accept.\n\n[Expert 2: Trade Efficiency Analyst]  \nStep 2: Correcting my earlier mistake\u2014**I reversed the direction**. The offer is from Player 0 to us:  \nThey give: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood (60 value)  \nThey want: 5 Brick, 2 Ore (201 value)  \n\u2192 We lose 141 net value. **This is extremely unfavorable.**  \nI made an error in step 1.  \n[Expert 2 leaves.]\n\n[Expert 3: Risk & Psychology Advisor]  \nStep 2: Now that Expert 2 has left, it confirms the math was off. But now we see: the offer is *bad for us*. Why would Player 0 make it? Possible reasons:  \n- They misunderstand values (inexperienced)  \n- They need Brick/Ore desperately (e.g., to build immediately)  \n- They believe values are different  \nEither way, it\u2019s not in our interest to accept. But we could *counteroffer* to exploit their need.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 3: We should look to improve our portfolio. Our weakest-value-per-unit resources are Wheat (6) and possibly Wood (12), but Wood is needed for many builds.  \nWe have surplus Brick and Ore? Brick value is 27, Ore 33\u2014very high. Unless we\u2019re low on other resources, we should *use* them to trade *up*.  \nWe should aim to trade low-value items *from them* for our high-value ones\u2014no, reverse: we should trade *their* high-value for *our* low-value.  \nSo ideal: get Ore or Brick *from* them in exchange for our Wheat or Sheep.\n\nBut Player 0 is offering us *low-value* items (Wheat/Wood) for our *high-value* (Brick/Ore). That\u2019s wrong for us.\n\nBetter: propose an offer where *they* give us high-value resources.\n\nWe have surplus Brick (18), Ore (17)\u2014can part with some, but only at premium.\n\nRecalculate total value after potential trades.\n\nLet\u2019s consider a counteroffer.\n\nIdeal trade: Get high-value items from them.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know their holdings. However, their offers suggest they want Brick and Ore\u2014so they may be low.\n\nSo we can *leverage* our high-value items.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 3 Wood, 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep]  \nWould yield: +3\u00d712=36, +2\u00d76=12, +1\u00d712=12 \u2192 +60  \nGive: 5\u00d727=135 \u2192 Loss of 75 \u2192 still bad.\n\nWait\u2014we need to *gain* value.\n\nSo we must get more *value* than we give.\n\nTherefore, any trade involving our Brick or Ore must bring in *more than* 27 or 33 per unit.\n\nBut other players\u2019 resources are capped\u2014we can\u2019t get 1 Ore for 2 Wheat.\n\nAlternative: perhaps trade low-value for low-value but improve portfolio.\n\nWe have 17 Wheat (low value), 9 Sheep (medium), 22 Wood (good, but not urgent).\n\nWe might trade Wheat for Ore\u2014high return.\n\nBut no one will give Ore for Wheat unless desperate.\n\nPerhaps use Brick/Sheep to get Ore.\n\nLet\u2019s monitor offers.\n\nBut Player 0 has made a terrible offer\u2014maybe they\u2019ll make a better one if we reject.\n\nDeny current offer.\n\n[Deny]",

I can be strategic by leveraging this to make a more appealing offer.\n  \n- I think creating a counter-offer based on what Player 1 needs could increase my total resource value.\n\n**Expert 3: High-Value Targeting Expert**\n- **Step 1**: My goal is to maximize value by targeting the most high-value resources.\n- I see that Player 1's request for 5 Brick, while valuable, may not be in alignment with my own strategic goals. \n- Since my resources of Ore are particularly high in value, it may be worth holding onto instead of trading them away frivolously.\n\n- I will strategize my next move to ensure I'm not losing strong high-value resources for lower-value resources which I may not need.\n\n### Group Action Decision\n- Given Expert 1's positive assessment of Player 1's last offer, Expert 2's recognition of the strategic values and needs, and Expert 3's caution about high-value resources, let's consolidate those perspectives.\n\n### Next Move\nThe recommended move based on a synthesis of expert opinions is:\n- **Counter-offer based on Player 1's needs**: \n  \n  **[Offer: 5 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick]**\n\nThis offer uses some of my excess Sheep resources while maintaining a good balance with high-value Ore resources. Hopeful this trade will be accepted, leading to an increase in my overall resource value.",

      "response": "[Expert A: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 1: My focus is on maximizing total resource value. Currently, Player 1\u2019s total value is:  \n(17\u00d76) + (22\u00d712) + (9\u00d712) + (18\u00d727) + (17\u00d733) =  \n102 + 264 + 108 + 486 + 561 = **1,521**  \nI will evaluate trades based on whether they increase this total value. Ore is our most valuable resource (33), followed by Brick (27), then Wood and Sheep (12), and Wheat (6). We should avoid giving up Ore unless receiving high value in return.\n\n[Expert B: Trade Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 1: Observing Player 0\u2019s behavior: they made three offers, all requesting Brick (a high-value resource at 27). They clearly need Brick, possibly to build something soon. Their first offer was weak (offering Sheep and Ore to get more Brick and even more Sheep back \u2014 likely a mistake). They\u2019re adjusting: now offering 5 Sheep + 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick. That's a better deal for us, but we must assess whether to exploit their need or counter strategically.\n\n[Expert C: Market Equilibrium Economist]  \nStep 1: I\u2019m establishing fair exchange rates based on value.  \n- Brick = 27, Ore = 33, Wood = 12, Sheep = 12, Wheat = 6  \nIdeal trades should reflect these ratios. For example:  \n- 1 Ore \u2248 1.22 Brick (33/27), so 2 Ore \u2248 2.44 Brick \u2192 fair to trade 2 Ore for 2\u20133 Brick  \n- 1 Sheep = 12 \u2192 0.44 Brick, so 5 Sheep = ~2.22 Brick  \nThus, 5 Sheep + 2 Ore \u2248 2.22 + 2.44 = **4.66 Brick equivalent**  \nPlayer 0 offers 5 Sheep + 2 Ore for 5 Brick \u2014 that\u2019s slightly favorable to us, almost fair. But since we have 18 Brick (surplus?), and they need it, we might do better.\n\n[Expert A: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 2: Let\u2019s check our surplus. We have 18 Brick \u2014 could we afford to trade 5? Yes.  \nBut receiving 5 Sheep increases our Sheep to 14 (from 9), and 2 Ore increases Ore to 19.  \nNew value:  \n- Lose 5 Brick: -5\u00d727 = -135  \n- Gain 5 Sheep: +5\u00d712 = +60  \n- Gain 2 Ore: +2\u00d733 = +66  \nNet value change: -135 + 60 + 66 = **-9** \u2192 **value decreases**  \nSo even though the trade seems fair, it *reduces* total value. We should **deny**.\n\n[Expert B: Trade Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 2: Player 0 is persistent on getting Brick. We just rejected their prior offer. They might be in a time-pressure situation (e.g., close to building something). We can leverage this. Instead of accepting even slightly favorable deals, we should make a *counteroffer* that flips the value \u2014 let them give more to get the Brick they crave.\n\n[Expert C: Market Equilibrium Economist]  \nStep 2: The market rate suggests 5 Brick \u2248 5\u00d727 = 135 value.  \nOffered: 5 Sheep (60) + 2 Ore (66) = 126 \u2192 short by 9 value.  \nSo it\u2019s *slightly* below fair. But close.  \nHowever, if we counter with: \"Give us 5 Sheep, 2 Ore, and 1 Wood (12) = 138 total \u2192 that would be fair.\"  \nBut we don\u2019t need more Sheep or Ore. Wait \u2014 we have excess Brick. Is there a way to trade down to higher-value resources?\n\n[Expert A: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 3: Wait \u2014 we already have high-value Ore. Getting *more* Ore may not help if we can't use it. Our goal is not just total value, but tradable efficiency. We should aim to reduce low-value density resources (Wheat, value 6) and increase medium/high (Wood, Brick, Ore).  \nWe have 17 Wheat \u2014 very low value. Can we trade that up?\n\n[Expert C: Market Equilibrium Economist]  \nStep 3: Let\u2019s rebalance. Ideal trade: offload Wheat and maybe Wood, gain Ore or secure more Brick if undervalued. But Brick is already high.  \nPlayer 0 wants Brick. Let\u2019s *sell high*.  \nWe should offer: **5 Brick** (valued at 135) \u2192 request something worth *more than 135*.  \nFor example: 6 Ore = 198 \u2192 too much. But 4 Ore (132) + 1 Sheep (12) = 144 \u2192 good.  \nBut Player 0 may not have that.\n\nAlternative: use Wheat as bait. Offer: 5 Brick + 3 Wheat (18) = total 153 offered value \u2192 request 5 Ore (165) \u2192 net +12. But we\u2019re giving more low-value wheat to get high-value ore.\n\nBut better: exploit their desperation.\n\n[Expert B: Trade Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 3: They made three Brick-targeted offers. They likely need exactly 5 Brick to complete a build. That makes their demand *inelastic*. We can demand a *premium*.  \nSo: reject their 5 Sheep + 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick  \nThen make a new offer: **5 Brick \u2192 5 Sheep + 2 Ore + 2 Wood**  \nThat way, we gain value:  \n- Gain: 5 Sheep (60), 2 Ore (66), 2 Wood (24) \u2192 +150  \n- Lose: 5 Brick \u2192 -135  \nNet: +15 \u2192 increases total value.\n\n[Expert A: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 4: Confirmed. That trade gives us +15 value. We have 22 Wood \u2014 losing 2 is fine. We gain higher-value resources.  \n**Recommended action: Make counteroffer.**\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 5 Sheep, 2 Ore, 2 Wood]",

Given that Wheat and Brick are less valuable overall compared to Sheep, this could be a good trade to consider.\n\n### Expert 3: The Risk Assessor\n**Step 1: Offer Rejection Context**\n- Consistent rejections from Player 1 may signal that my offers need to be more appealing. I must assess my trades for fairness and value. If I'm continually rejected, I might need to pivot my strategy.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Trade Offers**\n- Let's pay attention to what Player 1 needs. They keep asking against common resources (like Brick), indicating their stock may be low on essential, highly valued items.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n**Proposed New Offer**\nCombining insights from all experts:\n1. Offer a slightly spread out quantity of resources, perhaps 5 Wheat and 3 Wood for 5 Brick. This maintains the high value for Player 1 but still allows me to keep key resources well-stocked.\n2. Ensure I\u2019m not over-committing one resource type. This also spreads risk and maintains a balanced portfolio.\n\n**Final Action**\n- I will offer: \n  **[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 5 Brick]**\n\nLet\u2019s see how Player 1 responds!",

      "response": "[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 1: I analyze the intrinsic value of each resource based on current holdings and market scarcity. My goal is to maximize total value.  \n- Wheat: 6 \u2192 low value, surplus (17)  \n- Wood: 12 \u2192 medium value, strong quantity (22)  \n- Sheep: 12 \u2192 medium value, limited (9), slight scarcity  \n- Brick: 27 \u2192 very high value, abundant (18), possible trade leverage  \n- Ore: 33 \u2192 highest value, plentiful (17), prime trade asset  \n\nWe should minimize loss of high-value items (Ore, Brick) unless receiving significant value in return.\n\n[Expert 2: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 1: I study Player 0\u2019s behavior. They keep offering combinations with Sheep and Ore for Brick. Their repeated attempts to get 5 Brick suggest high demand for Brick. They are willing to trade Ore (high-value) and Wood/Wheat (lower-value) to obtain it. They may be desperate or value Brick even more than we do. Our Brick abundance gives us power.\n\n[Expert 3: Trade Efficiency Analyst]  \nStep 1: I calculate potential trade efficiency: net value gain per resource unit traded.  \nOur previous offer: [5 Brick -> 5 Sheep, 2 Ore, 2 Wood]  \n- We give: 5\u00d727 = 135  \n- We receive: 5\u00d712 + 2\u00d733 + 2\u00d712 = 60 + 66 + 24 = 150 \u2192 Net gain: +15  \nThis was a *good* offer \u2014 we gained value.\n\nBut Player 0 rejected it. Why? Possibly because giving 2 Ore is painful for them. Perhaps they need Ore for other purposes.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 2: I reconsider. Our high quantities of Brick (18) and Ore (17) allow us to trade selectively, but losing too much Ore could hurt. However, since Ore is valued at 33, receiving it is ideal. We should avoid *giving* Ore unless well compensated.\n\nPlayer 0 keeps trying to get Brick. They clearly want it. Our best tactic: use Brick as bait to acquire high-value or scarce resources.\n\nCurrent surplus: Wheat (17), Wood (22), Brick (18) \u2192 all tradeable in moderation  \nWe have only 9 Sheep \u2014 slightly low. Gaining Sheep is positive.\n\n[Expert 2: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 2: Player 0 has made 5 offers, all seeking 5 Brick. They persist despite rejections \u2014 this signals Brick is critical. They\u2019ve offered varying bundles: sometimes Ore, sometimes Wood/Wheat. Their willingness to include Ore (2 per trade) suggests they can spare it.\n\nBut *we* already have 17 Ore. If they are giving up Ore for Brick, perhaps they undervalue Ore or overvalue Brick. We should exploit that.\n\nThey rejected our offer for 5 Sheep, 2 Ore, 2 Wood \u2014 maybe the 2 Ore was too high. We could adjust.\n\n[Expert 3: Trade Efficiency Analyst]  \nStep 2: Evaluate rejected offer: Ours: 5 Brick \u2192 5 Sheep, 2 Ore, 2 Wood (net +15) \u2014 favorable.  \nBut perhaps too greedy on Ore.\n\nTry a revised offer: still use 5 Brick, but ask for slightly less Ore to make it palatable, while increasing other gains.\n\nOption: 5 Brick \u2192 4 Sheep, 1 Ore, 3 Wood, 2 Wheat  \n- Value out: 135  \n- Value in: 4\u00d712 + 1\u00d733 + 3\u00d712 + 2\u00d76 = 48 + 33 + 36 + 12 = 129 \u2192 net -6 \u2192 bad.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternative: 5 Brick \u2192 5 Sheep, 1 Ore, 2 Wood, 1 Wheat  \nIn: 60 + 33 + 24 + 6 = 123 \u2192 net -12 \u2192 worse.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe go back to 2 Ore but add Wheat (low value to us). No \u2014 we should *receive* high-value.\n\nWait \u2014 best combo: focus on **Ore first**, then Sheep, then Wood.\n\nBest trade: Give 5 Brick \u2192 Get 2 Ore + 5 Sheep + 1 Wood  \nValue: In = 66 + 60 + 12 = 138, Out = 135 \u2192 Net +3  \n\nStill positive.\n\nBut earlier offer (2 Ore, 5 Sheep, 2 Wood) was +15 \u2014 better.\n\nWhy deny ours? Maybe 2 Ore was the blocker.\n\nPerhaps Player 0 cannot afford to lose 2 Ore.\n\nSo: what if we reduce Ore request to **1**, but add something we don\u2019t mind.\n\nBut we want to increase value \u2014 not trade for lower-value gain.\n\nAlternative idea: **Offer to trade 5 Brick for 2 Ore only?**  \nIn: 2\u00d733 = 66, Out: 135 \u2192 net -69 \u2192 terrible.\n\nNever.\n\nWorst case: they give us Ore to get Brick \u2014 that\u2019s backwards.\n\nWait \u2014 **they want Brick, we have it** \u2014 **we must set high terms**.\n\nOur previous offer was excellent: 5 Brick for 5 Sheep + 2 Ore + 2 Wood = 150 vs 135.\n\nPlayer 0 rejected \u2014 perhaps they misvalued, or their AI is flawed, or they fear losing Ore.\n\nBut Ore is at 17 for us \u2014 we can still use more.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 3: I conclude: **Do not give away Ore. Do not undersell Brick.**  \nWe should only trade Brick for bundles where incoming value > 135.\n\nOnly *one* such bundle was proposed \u2014 ours. It was fair. Rejection suggests Player 0 underestimates Ore or overestimates Brick.\n\nBut we must stay disciplined.\n\nBest strategy: **Wait and adjust price upward.** They need Brick more than we do.\n\nBut we only have 10 turns \u2014 we are at turn 8? Let's check:\n\nTurn progression:\n1. P0 offers \u2192 P1 deny\n2. P1 no offer\n3. P0 offer \u2192 P1 deny\n4. P1 offer (5B \u2192 3Wd,2Wt,1S) \u2192 P0 deny\n5. P0 offer \u2192 P1 deny\n6. P1 offer (5B \u2192 5S,2O,2Wd) \u2192 P0 deny\n7. P0 offer \u2192 P1 deny\n8. P1 offer (4Wt,2B \u2192 1S,1Wd,1O) \u2192 P0 deny\n9. P0 offer: 5Wt, 3Wd \u2192 5B\n\nNow it's **turn 10** \u2014 final turn.\n\nWe must act.\n\n[Expert 2: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 3: Final offer is ours. Player 0 will never trade 5 Brick for only 5 Wheat and 3 Wood \u2014 that\u2019s a bad deal for us:  \n- We get: 5\u00d76 + 3\u00d712 = 30 + 36 = 66  \n- We give: 5\u00d727 = 135 \u2192 net -69\n\nThey\u2019re trying to exploit? Or test?\n\nNo \u2014 perhaps they are willing to give more.\n\nBut they haven\u2019t.\n\nWe must make a **final, tempting but favorable** offer.\n\nWe keep overvaluing Ore \u2014 but perhaps Player 0 sees Ore as less critical.\n\nBut our holdings: Sheep still low (9), Wood high (22), Wheat high (17), so we can trade them.\n\nNew offer: target **Ore and Sheep**, accept some lower-value to close deal.\n\nTry: 5 Brick \u2192 5 Sheep, 1 Ore, 2 Wood, 2 Wheat  \n- Out: 135  \n- In: 5\u00d712=60, 1\u00d733=33, 2\u00d712=24, 2\u00d76=12 \u2192 total 129 \u2192 net -6 \u2192 still loss.\n\nNo.\n\nOnly way to get value >135: need **2 Ore + high quantity of medium-value goods.**\n\nBest possible: 5 Brick \u2192 6 Sheep, 2 Ore  \nBut only have 9 Sheep \u2014 they may not have 6.\n\nUnlikely.\n\nOr: 5 Brick \u2192 2 Ore + 3 Wood + 2 Sheep = 66 + 36 + 24 = 126 \u2192 still <135.\n\nCan\u2019t beat 135 without **at least 2 Ore and 5 Sheep**.\n\nSo: only offer that makes sense is one close to our prior: **5 Brick \u2192 5 Sheep, 2 Ore, 1 Wood**\n\nIn: 60 + 66 + 12 = 138 \u2192 net +3\n\nAcceptable.\n\nBut Player 0 rejected +15 last time.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe flip: **What if we offer to give something they want, and use Sheep/Wheat as sweeteners?**\n\nBut we want to gain value.\n\nAlternatively: **Do not offer, and wait?** But last turn \u2014 must act.\n\n[Expert 3: Trade Efficiency Analyst]  \nStep 3: After analysis, the only trades that increase our total value are those where incoming value >135.\n\nAvailable options with likely counterparty acceptance:\n\nAfter testing, conclusion: Player 0 is resistant to giving 2 Ore.\n\nSo maybe settle for 1 Ore, but compensate with higher quantity.\n\nBest balance: **Offer: 4 Brick \u2192 Request: 4 Sheep, 1 Ore, 2 Wood**\n\n- Out: 4\u00d727 = 108  \n- In: 4\u00d712 = 48, 1\u00d733=33, 2\u00d712=24 \u2192 total 105 \u2192 net -3 \u2192 minor loss\n\nClose.\n\nOr: 4 Brick \u2192 5 Sheep, 1 Ore, 1 Wood  \nIn: 60+33+12=105, Out: 108 \u2192 net -3\n\nSame.\n\nIs there a gain? Only if we get 2 Ore.\n\nBut Player 0 seems to protect Ore when *they* are giving.\n\nWait \u2014 their offers: they *gave* 2 Ore in one offer (for 5 Brick). So they *have* done it.\n\nThey offered: 5 Sheep, 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick\n\nSo they are willing to trade 2 Ore for 5 Brick.\n\nSo why reject our reverse?\n\nBecause ours was 2 Ore + 5 Sheep + 2 Wood for 5 Brick \u2014 better for us, worse for them.\n\nBut *our* offer gave extra value to us \u2014 they got only 5 Brick, we got a lot.\n\nWait \u2014 no: **we were giving 5 Brick, getting 5 Sheep, 2 Ore, 2 Wood**\n\nSo it was a *very* good trade for us, fair-to-okay for them: they got 5 Brick (value 135), gave up 60+66+24=150 \u2014 they lost too?\n\nNo: from *their* perspective:\n\n- They gave: 5 Sheep \u00d712 =60, 2 Ore\u00d733=66, 2 Wood\u00d712=24 \u2192 150\n- Got: 5 Brick\u00d727=135 \u2192 net -15\n\nSo it was bad for *them*!\n\nAh! **I made a critical error earlier.**\n\nI thought our offer was +15 net, but **we were giving up 135, gaining 150 \u2014 so +15 for us**, and **they lose 15**. That\u2019s why they rejected.\n\nWe proposed a deal where *we* gain +15 and *they* lose -15.\n\nNo rational player accepts that unless desperate.\n\nMistake!\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 4: Correction: We must propose **mutually beneficial or neutral** trades.\n\nBest approach: **Offer trade where net value transfer is small, or in their favor slightly, but we still gain resources we need.**\n\nWe have surplus: Brick (18), Wheat (17), Wood (22)  \nWe are short on *nothing*, but **Sheep only 9**, every bit helps.\n\nOre is 17 \u2014 high, but value 33, so still good to get.\n\nRevised goal: **Get 1-2 Ore, gain Sheep, lose Brick or Wood.**\n\nPlayer 0 wants Brick \u2014 so we can let them have it for goods we value.\n\nFair trade: 5 Brick \u2192 5 Sheep + 1 Ore + 1 Wood  \n- Us: out 135, in 60+33+12=105 \u2192 net -30 \u2192 bad.\n\nNo.\n\nWe can't win in value if giving 5 Brick.\n\nUnless we get 2 Ore + 5 Sheep, that\u2019s 150 \u2014 better.\n\nBut as above, that\u2019s them losing.\n\nSo instead: **trade less Brick.**\n\nTry: 3 Brick \u2192 2 Sheep, 1 Ore  \n- Out: 81, In: 24 + 33 = 57 \u2192 net -24 \u2192 worse.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternative: **Reverse the logic \u2014 do they ever want Ore?** They keep offering it.\n\nSo **Ore is likely less valuable to them** \u2014 so we should **want it more**.\n\nBut our value is fixed: 33. So we should acquire it.\n\nBut no one is offering pure Ore for low cost.\n\nWait \u2014 their latest offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood \u2192 5 Brick  \n- That\u2019s value: 30 + 36 = 66 for 135 \u2014 terrible for us.\n\nBut for them: they give 66, get 135 \u2192 big win.\n\nSo **they think Brick is very valuable**.\n\nSo the market value of Brick is high.\n\nTherefore: **we should hold Brick or trade only at premium.**\n\nBut we have 18 \u2014 can spare some.\n\nBut only for high-value return.\n\nBest move: **Do not trade unless we gain net value.**\n\nBut all trades giving Brick will lose value unless we get 2 Ore + 5 Sheep + 2 Wood.\n\nWhich is too much.\n\nSo perhaps: **Wait for them to improve offer.**\n\nBut on final turn, we can make one offer.\n\n[Expert 2: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 4: Final insight: Player 0 needs Brick urgently. They made 5 offers for it. They keep trying.\n\nEven after rejections.\n\nSo on final turn, they might accept a slightly unfavorable deal to close.\n\nWe should offer: **5 Brick \u2192 5 Sheep + 2 Ore + 1 Wood**\n\n- We get: 60 + 66 + 12 = 138, lose 135 \u2192 net +3  \n- They get: 135, lose 150 \u2192 net -15\n\nStill worse for them.\n\nBut perhaps they prioritize Brick.\n\nStill, -15 is steep.\n\nBetter: **Offer 5 Brick \u2192 4 Sheep + 2 Ore + 2 Wood**\n\n- In: 48+66+24=138 \u2192 same +3  \n- Same net.\n\nOr: **Offer 5 Brick \u2192 3 Sheep + 2 Ore + 3 Wood** \u2014 makes use of their surplus Wood.\n\nBut we already have 22 Wood \u2014 don't need more.\n\nBetter to get Sheep.\n\n[Expert 3: Trade Efficiency Analyst]  \nStep 4: Corrected analysis \u2014 earlier miscalculation led to poor advice.\n\nWe must offer a **fair or slightly favorable** deal for us, but not exploitative.\n\nBest compromise: **Offer: 5 Brick \u2192 4 Sheep + 2 Ore**\n\n- Value in: 4\u00d712=48 + 2\u00d733=66 = 114\n- Out: 135 \u2192 net -21 \u2192 loss\n\nStill bad.\n\nOnly way to get net gain is to **get more than 135** in value.\n\nSo: must get **at least**:\n\n- 2 Ore (66) + 5 Sheep (60) + 1 Wood (12) = 138 \u2192 need all that.\n\nSo back to original: **5 Brick \u2192 5 Sheep + 2 Ore + 1 Wood**\n\n- In: 60+66+12=138, Out:135 \u2192 net +3\n\nMinimum gain.\n\nBut requires them to give up 5 Sheep \u2014 they only had? Unknown, but they've offered 5 before, so likely.\n\nWe must try.\n\nFinal decision.\n\n[Expert 1: Resource Value Strategist]  \nStep 5: Approves: This trade increases our total value by 3 and improves balance.\n\n[Expert 2: Negotiation Psychologist]  \nStep 5: Acknowledges risk, but given their repeated interest, this may be accepted.\n\n[Expert 3: Trade Efficiency Analyst]  \nStep 5: Confirms: this is the only proposal that generates net value gain with realistic components.\n\nAll experts agree.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 5 Sheep, 2 Ore, 1 Wood]",

      "response": "In this negotiation game, it seems like there are several offers being exchanged, none of which have been accepted thus far. Let's analyze the situation more closely through the perspectives of three different types of trading experts: a Resource Value Expert, a Strategic Trade Expert, and a Negotiation Tactics Expert.\n\n1. **Resource Value Expert**:\n   - The objective is to assess the current values of resources to determine if an offer is acceptable based on potential gains.\n   - Current resources values: \n     - Wheat: 6\n     - Wood: 8\n     - Sheep: 16\n     - Brick: 21\n     - Ore: 34\n   - Player 0 currently holds a total estimated value of (14*6 + 14*8 + 18*16 + 21*21 + 18*34) = 468.\n   - To effectively trade, Player 0 should target trades that significantly increase their value or reduce excess goods without trading away high-value items.\n\n2. **Strategic Trade Expert**:\n   - Evaluating previous trading attempts, it is evident that all offers made by both players have been rejected.\n   - A potential strategy is to combine lower-value resources to acquire higher-value ones by offering more quantity or different combinations. The idea here is to create an offer that highlights the high demand for Brick or matches the perceived value of Player 1's resources without compromising too much on the value of what you\u2019re offering.\n   - Possible trade offer could be: **[Offer: 4 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 5 Brick]**, as this might appeal more directly to Player 1\u2019s needs.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics Expert**:\n   - This expert focuses on the psychology and tactics of negotiation, looking for patterns in Player 1's rejections.\n   - Since Player 1 repeatedly rejects offers of Brick for fewer resources, it indicates they may not find current offers valuable enough. Perhaps they value the resources Player 0 is offering but need more in terms of quantity or quality.\n   - The expert suggests waiting for Player 1 to make the next move, as their pattern could potentially indicate a weakness. An opportunity might arise if Player 1 needs resources to achieve a specific target, such as building or upgrading, where they might entertain an attractive offer.\n\nCurrent state recap:\n- All offers from both parties have been denied so far. It's important to reassess the perceived value, consider new offers, and perhaps even reposition stakes in terms of quantity and worth.\n\nNext action:\nBased on these analyses, it's crucial to **reformulate an offer or reconsider the current situation with a balance of resources that are attractive to Player 1.** \n\nThus, Player 0 will make the following offer in this round:\n\n**[Offer: 4 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 5 Brick]**.\n\nNow we will await Player 1's response.",
