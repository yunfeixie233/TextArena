      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the negotiation advice process as described in your query. As Player 0, my goal is to increase the total value of my resources through trading. First, I'll briefly outline the three trading experts I've selected, as they seem most helpful for analyzing this situation:\n\n1. **Value Maximizer Expert**: Focuses purely on maximizing the net value gain from trades by calculating the monetary value of resources exchanged. This expert ensures every trade results in a higher total value for me.\n   \n2. **Resource Balancer Expert**: Considers the overall balance of my resources, aiming to diversify or address potential shortages. This expert might prioritize trades that make my resource portfolio more even or strategic, even if the immediate value gain isn't the highest.\n\n3. **Risk Assessor Expert**: Evaluates the risks of trades, such as overcommitting resources or depending too much on uncertain future needs. This expert advises on conservative moves to avoid losses or vulnerabilities.\n\nMy current resources and their total value are:\n- Wheat: 18 qty (Value: 5 each) = 90 total value\n- Wood: 22 qty (Value: 8 each) = 176 total value\n- Sheep: 23 qty (Value: 17 each) = 391 total value\n- Brick: 14 qty (Value: 30 each) = 420 total value\n- Ore: 25 qty (Value: 40 each) = 1000 total value\n- **Overall Total Value: 2077**\n\nThe experts will now analyze the situation step by step. Each expert will share one step of their thinking, then they'll all proceed to the next step based on the shared insights. If an expert realizes their advice is flawed (e.g., it doesn't align with the goal of increasing total value), they'll leave the discussion.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Analysis (Each expert shares their first thoughts)\n\n**Value Maximizer Expert:** My initial analysis focuses on the values: Ore is our most valuable resource at 40 per unit, and we have plenty (25 qty). Wheat is the least valuable at 5 per unit. To maximize value, we should trade low-value resources like Wheat for high-value ones like Brick or Ore. For example, offering 10 Wheat (worth 50 value) could net us resources worth more than that, say 2 Brick (worth 60 value). This would increase our total value immediately.\n\n**Resource Balancer Expert:** From a balancing perspective, we have a lot of Ore (25 qty) and Sheep (23 qty) but relatively less Brick (14 qty). While value is important, we might want to trade excess Ore or Sheep for more Brick to create a more even distribution. This could help in future scenarios where balanced resources are key. I'd suggest exploring trades that reduce our surplus in high-quantity items without depleting them entirely.\n\n**Risk Assessor Expert:** I agree with the others on potential trades, but we need to assess risks. We have 10 turns total, so overtrading early could leave us short. For instance, if we trade away too much Ore now, we might regret it later. Let's ensure any trade keeps us above a minimum stock (e.g., 10 qty per resource) to avoid vulnerability. A safe starting point might be small trades, like offering 1-2 units of a resource.\n\n### Step 2: Building on Shared Insights (Experts respond and refine)\n\n**Value Maximizer Expert:** Building on the group's input, let's quantify a potential trade. If we offer 5 Sheep (worth 85 value) and 2 Ore (worth 80 value, total offered: 165 value), we could request 3 Brick (worth 90 value) and 1 Wood (worth 8 value, total requested: 98 value). Wait, that's only a net gain of -67 value\u2014 that's not maximizing! I must have miscalculated. Actually, this trade would decrease our value, so I'm reevaluating. A better option: Offer 10 Wheat (worth 50 value) for 1 Brick (worth 30 value) and 2 Sheep (worth 34 value, total requested: 64 value). Net gain: +14 value. That works. I'll stick with this.\n\n**Resource Balancer Expert:** Responding to the Value Maximizer, I like the idea of trading Wheat, as it's our lowest quantity relative to value, but we should also consider balance. We have 18 Wheat, which is moderate, so trading 10 won't hurt. However, adding the Risk Assessor's caution, let's not go below 10 Wheat. This trade maintains diversity and aligns with my focus. No issues here.\n\n**Risk Assessor Expert:** The Value Maximizer's refined trade looks solid\u2014offering low-value Wheat for a mix of Brick and Sheep could work without major risks. It keeps our quantities above 10 for most resources. But if we accept this, we need to ensure it's the first of several turns. I'm not seeing any red flags, so I'll continue advising.\n\n### Step 3: Final Consensus and Recommendation (Experts conclude or any departures)\n\n**Value Maximizer Expert:** After reviewing the feedback, my calculation confirms the trade I suggested in Step 2: Offering 10 Wheat for 1 Brick and 2 Sheep would net +14 value, increasing our total to 2091. This is a clear win. If no better offers come in, we should proceed.\n\n**Resource Balancer Expert:** I concur\u2014this trade improves balance by gaining Brick (which we're short on) without over-depleting Wheat. It's a good step toward a more diversified portfolio.\n\n**Risk Assessor Expert:** This seems low-risk: We're not trading high-value Ore or overcommitting. I'll support it as long as we're prepared for potential counteroffers in future turns.\n\nNo experts are leaving, as their analyses align and support the goal of increasing total value.\n\n### My Decision as Player 0\nBased on the experts' analysis, I'll go with the recommended trade to increase my total value. This is Turn 1 of 10.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 2 Sheep]",

If any expert realizes they're wrong, they'll leave the discussion.\n\n### Expert Discussion\n\n**Step 1: Initial Thoughts**  \nEach expert shares their first analysis based on the situation: My previous offer (10 Wheat for 1 Brick and 2 Sheep) was rejected, as it involved giving 50 value for 64 value\u2014a net loss for me and likely unappealing for Player 1 since they wouldn't gain value either.\n\n- **Expert A (Value Maximizer)**: \"Our previous offer was a bad move\u2014it decreased our total value by 14 (50 given vs. 64 received). To increase our value from 2077, we should only trade low-value resources like Wheat (5 value each) for high-value ones like Ore (40 value each) or Brick (30 value each). Aim for trades where the incoming value exceeds the outgoing value by at least 10-20% to ensure a clear gain.\"\n\n- **Expert B (Resource Strategist)**: \"We have abundant Wheat (18 qty) and Wood (22 qty), which are low-value and might be overstocked. Meanwhile, Brick (14 qty) and Ore (25 qty) are high-value but could be useful for building or trading later. We should trade excess low-value items for resources that complement our portfolio, avoiding over-reliance on any one type to prevent future shortages.\"\n\n- **Expert C (Opponent Analyzer)**: \"Player 1 rejected our offer because it didn't benefit them\u2014they were asked to give high-value items (1 Brick = 30, 2 Sheep = 34 total) for less value (10 Wheat = 50). They might value Sheep highly or have a surplus of Wheat. To make a new offer, we need to sweeten the deal by including something they might want, like Wood or Ore, while ensuring we still gain value overall.\"\n\n**Step 2: Building on Shared Thoughts**  \nThe experts review each other's input and refine their analysis.\n\n- **Expert A (Value Maximizer)**: \"Building on Expert B and C's points, I agree we should use Wheat or Wood for trades. For instance, offering 10 Wheat (50 value) for 1 Ore (40 value) would be a loss, so that's out. Instead, propose 5 Wood (40 value) for 1 Brick (30 value)\u2014that's a net gain of 10 value for us. This aligns with Expert C's view that Player 1 might reject unbalanced offers.\"\n\n- **Expert B (Resource Strategist)**: \"Expert A is spot-on about net gains, and Expert C's opponent focus is crucial. We have 22 Wood, which is plentiful, so trading it makes sense. However, we should ensure we don't deplete Wheat too much (we only have 18). A trade like offering Wood for Brick could balance our resources better, as Brick is scarcer for us and high-value.\"\n\n- **Expert C (Opponent Analyzer)**: \"Expert A and B are correct; we need to make the offer mutually beneficial. Player 1 might need Wood for building, given they rejected our Wheat-heavy offer. If we offer, say, Wood and a bit of Sheep (which they wanted last time), we could get Brick in return. But if this doesn't work, we risk wasting a turn, and we only have 10 total.\"\n\n**Step 3: Refinement and Consensus**  \nThe experts react to the previous step and finalize advice.\n\n- **Expert A (Value Maximizer)**: \"After reviewing, our best option is to propose a trade that guarantees a value increase. Offering 5 Wood (40 value) for 1 Brick (30 value) gives us a net gain of 10, which beats our current total. This also incorporates Expert B's balance idea and Expert C's opponent insight. If Player 1 counters, we can adjust, but this is low-risk.\"\n\n- **Expert B (Resource Strategist)**: \"I agree with Expert A\u2014this trade uses our excess Wood without depleting critical resources. It keeps our portfolio diverse. No issues here; we're aligned.\"\n\n- **Expert C (Opponent Analyzer)**: \"This makes sense. By offering Wood, which Player 1 might value, we're more likely to get a positive response. If they reject again, we might need to involve more of their preferred resources like Sheep. I'm fully on board.\"\n\nAt this point, all experts are in agreement, so the discussion concludes. No one realizes they're wrong, so all remain.\n\n### My Decision as Player 0\nBased on the experts' analysis, I'll make a new offer that prioritizes increasing my total value while addressing the previous rejection. The proposed trade: Offer 5 Wood (value: 40) for 1 Brick (value: 30), resulting in a net gain of 10 value, bringing my total to 2087 if accepted.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Brick]",

These experts are chosen based on what would be most helpful for this decision:\n\n1. **Value Maximizer Expert**: Focuses on calculating and maximizing the net value of trades based on the given resource values, ensuring short-term gains.\n2. **Resource Scarcity Expert**: Evaluates the availability of resources, considering quantities I have and potential future needs, to avoid depleting critical items.\n3. **Long-Term Strategy Expert**: Considers broader game implications, such as how this trade might affect future turns (e.g., building or negotiating leverage), while assuming the game lasts 10 turns.\n\nThe experts will proceed step by step:\n- Each expert writes one step of their thinking.\n- They share their steps with the group.\n- Then, they all move to the next step.\n- If any expert realizes they're wrong, they leave the discussion.\n\nI'll facilitate this process, then make my final decision as Player 0 based on their input.\n\n### Step 1: Each Expert Writes and Shares Their First Step of Thinking\n\n**Value Maximizer Expert's Step 1:**  \n\"I calculate the net value of Player 1's offer. I'm receiving 4 Sheep (4 \u00d7 17 = 68 value) and 1 Ore (1 \u00d7 40 = 40 value), totaling 108 value. I'm giving 2 Brick (2 \u00d7 30 = 60 value) and 1 Wood (1 \u00d7 8 = 8 value), totaling 68 value. This results in a net gain of 108 - 68 = 40 value. This trade increases my total resource value, which aligns with our goal, so I recommend accepting.\"\n\n**Resource Scarcity Expert's Step 1:**  \n\"I check my current quantities to ensure I'm not giving away scarce resources. I have 14 Brick and 22 Wood, so giving 2 Brick and 1 Wood won't deplete these (leaving me with 12 Brick and 21 Wood). In contrast, I'm receiving Sheep (I have 23) and Ore (I have 25), which are already abundant. No immediate scarcity issues here, but I need to confirm if this fits broader needs.\"\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Expert's Step 1:**  \n\"I consider the game's 10-turn limit and potential future trades. Accepting this gives me more Ore, which is high-value (40 each) and might be useful for later high-stakes trades or builds. However, I'm losing Brick, which is also valuable (30 each), and I should think about if I might need it soon. Overall, the net value gain is positive, but I want to ensure this doesn't weaken my position in upcoming negotiations.\"\n\n### Step 2: Experts Review and Write Their Next Step\n\n**Value Maximizer Expert's Step 2 (after reviewing others):**  \n\"Building on my initial calculation, the other experts' points reinforce this as a strong deal. The Resource Scarcity Expert notes no depletion risks, and the Long-Term Strategy Expert sees potential benefits. No flaws in my reasoning, so I still strongly recommend accepting for the clear value increase.\"\n\n**Resource Scarcity Expert's Step 2 (after reviewing others):**  \n\"After hearing the Value Maximizer's numbers, I agree the trade is feasible\u2014my quantities are sufficient, and gaining more Sheep and Ore could help if I need to trade them later. The Long-Term Strategy Expert's point about future needs is valid, but I don't see any red flags. I'm fully on board.\"\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Expert's Step 2 (after reviewing others):**  \n\"Reviewing the group's input, the Value Maximizer's net gain of 40 is compelling, and the Resource Scarcity Expert confirms I won't be left vulnerable. This could position me better for future turns, as Ore is a premium resource. No issues with my initial thinking\u2014let's proceed with acceptance.\"\n\n### Step 3: Final Review and Conclusion\n\nAt this point, all experts have shared their steps and agree on the decision. No expert has identified an error in their reasoning, so none are leaving the discussion. Based on their consensus\u2014emphasizing the net value gain, no scarcity risks, and positive long-term implications\u2014I'll proceed as Player 0.\n\n**My Decision as Player 0:**  \nThe experts' analysis shows this trade increases my total resource value by 40, while maintaining sufficient quantities for future turns.

We'll bring in three different types of experts for varied perspectives:\n\n### Expert 1: Resource Valuation Expert\n- **Step 1**: Calculate the total value of Player 1's resources.\n  - Wheat (19 * 5) = 95\n  - Wood (21 * 9) = 189\n  - Sheep (10 * 13) = 130\n  - Brick (8 * 22) = 176\n  - Ore (7 * 33) = 231\n  - **Total Value**: 95 + 189 + 130 + 176 + 231 = 821\n\n- **Next Step**: Investigate what trades can increase our total resource value.\n\n### Expert 2: Trading Strategy Expert\n- **Step 1**: Analyze previous offers made.\n  - Player 0 offered 10 Wheat for 1 Brick and 2 Sheep: Rejected. \n  - Player 0 subsequently offered 5 Wood for 1 Brick: Rejected.\n  - Player 1's offer (4 Sheep, 1 Ore for 2 Brick, 1 Wood) was accepted by Player 0.\n\n- **Next Step**: Consider offers that might provide a better return. Since Wood and Brick are commonly sought, focusing on those resources is key.\n\n### Expert 3: Risk Assessment Expert\n- **Step 1**: Assess the risk associated with trading valuable resources.\n  - Sheep and Ore are high-value resources for Player 1, so trading them must be done cautiously.\n  - The previous trades made by Player 0 indicate that they are low on Wood and Brick, suggesting they might overvalue these resources. \n\n- **Next Step**: Propose trades accordingly while ensuring not to give away too many valuable resources.\n\n### Trading Iteration\n\n- **Decision**: Player 1 should leverage the high value of Ore and consider offers that maximize Brick, which were rejected before, but can now be beneficial considering Player 0's low stock. \n\n**Proposed Trade Offer by Player 1:**\n1. Player 1 offers: \n   - **[Offer: 2 Ore, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood]**\n   - This offer uses valuable resources (Ore, Sheep) but aims for a significant gain in bricks and some wood since they seem to be in demand.\n\nIn summary, here's the step forward:\n**[Offer: 2 Ore, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood]**",

      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the advisory process as per the game instructions. As Player 0, I'm evaluating Player 1's latest offer: **Offered items: 2 Ore and 2 Sheep -> Requested items: 3 Brick and 1 Wood**. My goal is to increase the total value of my resources, so I'll consult three trading experts to analyze this situation from different perspectives.\n\nFirst, I'll define the three experts based on what would be most helpful for this trading decision:\n- **Expert 1: Value Calculator** \u2013 Focuses purely on maximizing the net value of trades based on the given resource values (e.g., Wheat: 5, Wood: 8, Sheep: 17, Brick: 30, Ore: 40).\n- **Expert 2: Quantity Strategist** \u2013 Considers resource quantities, potential future needs, and maintaining a balanced portfolio to avoid shortages.\n- **Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician** \u2013 Analyzes player behavior, negotiation patterns, and the risks of accepting or rejecting offers to build leverage for future turns.\n\nThe experts will proceed step by step:\n- Each expert writes one step of their thinking.\n- They share their thoughts with the group.\n- Then, they move to the next step collectively.\n- If any expert realizes they're wrong, they leave the discussion.\n\nI'll now simulate this process based on the current offer.\n\n### Step 1: Each Expert Shares Their Initial Thinking\n\n**Expert 1 (Value Calculator):**  \nMy first thought: Calculate the net value change from this trade. I'm giving 3 Brick (value: 30 each, so 3 \u00d7 30 = 90) and 1 Wood (value: 8), totaling 98 value given. I'm receiving 2 Ore (value: 40 each, so 2 \u00d7 40 = 80) and 2 Sheep (value: 17 each, so 2 \u00d7 17 = 34), totaling 114 value received. Net gain: 114 - 98 = +16. This is a positive trade for increasing total value, so I lean toward accepting.\n\n**Expert 2 (Quantity Strategist):**  \nMy first thought: Check my current quantities and how this affects balance. I have 14 Brick and 22 Wood to give, so I can afford it. Receiving more Ore (I have 25) and Sheep (I have 23) won't unbalance me much, as I'm already stockpile-heavy in those. However, Brick is valuable and I'm giving away 3, which might limit future builds if this game requires it. Still, the trade seems okay for now.\n\n**Expert 3 (Negotiation Tactician):**  \nMy first thought: Review the history\u2014Player 1 rejected my offers twice and made counteroffers. Their latest offer is less demanding than their previous one (which I accepted), but it's still asking for more Brick. Accepting could build goodwill and encourage better deals later, but rejecting might pressure them to sweeten it. I need to weigh if +16 value is worth potentially stronger future negotiations.\n\n### Step 2: Experts Share and Refine Their Thinking Based on the Group\n\nNow that they've shared, each expert reacts to the others and refines their analysis.\n\n**Expert 1 (Value Calculator):**  \nBuilding on the group's input, I see Expert 2's concern about quantities, but from a pure value perspective, a +16 net gain is objectively beneficial. My calculation doesn't change\u2014it's still a win. However, if Expert 2 is right about future shortages, I might need to adjust. For now, I stick with recommending acceptance.\n\n**Expert 2 (Quantity Strategist):**  \nReacting to Expert 1 and 3, Expert 1's value math is solid, and Expert 3's point on negotiation is valid. I have plenty of Ore and Sheep already, so receiving more doesn't help much, but I'm giving away Brick, which is scarcer for me relative to its value. Still, my quantities won't drop critically (e.g., Brick: 14 - 3 = 11 left), so this trade is acceptable without major risk. I agree with Expert 1.\n\n**Expert 3 (Negotiation Tactician):**  \nAfter hearing the others, Expert 1's value gain and Expert 2's quantity check make a strong case for acceptance. Player 1 has been inconsistent\u2014rejecting my offers but making theirs\u2014 so accepting could signal cooperation and lead to more trades in the remaining turns (we're likely past the midpoint of 10 turns). I don't see a major downside here, so I'll revise: This is a good move for long-term leverage.\n\n### Step 3: Final Consensus or Exit\n\nAt this point, all experts have shared and refined their thoughts without any realizing they're wrong, so no one leaves. Based on the discussion:\n- Expert 1 emphasizes the clear net value gain (+16).\n- Expert 2 confirms it's feasible without disrupting quantities.\n- Expert 3 supports it for negotiation advantages.\n\nOverall consensus: Accept the offer, as it aligns with my goal of increasing total resource value.\n\n**My Decision as Player 0:**  \n[Accept]",

      "response": "To maximize the total value of your resources, I'll consider three different trading experts, each approaching the negotiation with their unique perspective.\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Maximizer\n- **Step 1**: First, I analyze the current resources and their values. We need to look for trades that can significantly enhance our resource value. Notably, Ore has the highest value at 33, and Brick is highly sought after.\n- **Decision**: I will propose a trade that uses some of our Sheep (which have moderate value) to gain Brick, which we identify as a key resource for building.\n\n### Expert 2: The Demand & Supply Analyst\n- **Step 1**: I will evaluate the trade offers that have already been made. There seems to be a consistent interest in Brick and Wood. We should leverage this demand.\n- **Decision**: I will suggest a trade that converts Ore into more resource value, as Ore has high demand among players. I consider the last accepted trade that Player 0 made useful for analyzing future offers.\n\n### Expert 3: The Resource Balancer\n- **Step 1**: My goal is to balance out the resources to avoid becoming overly dependent on one type. I see that we have excess Sheep, and creating balance can help us make more favorable trades in the future.\n- **Decision**: I will look to offer a combination of Sheep and Wood to gain Brick and possibly maintain some Ore since it has high value.\n\n### Turn 1 Action: \nPlayer 1 will make the following trade offer based on Expert analyses:\n\n**[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick, 2 Ore]**\n\nThis offer aims to leverage excess Sheep and some Wood to gain Brick and Ore, maximizing both value and balance in resources.\n\n### Next Steps:\nOnce the offer is made, we would wait for Player 0's response. If the offer is accepted, I would reassess if the deal enhances our total resource value. If denied, we will analyze the situation again based on Player 0's counteroffers.",

      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the advisory process for your current trading decision as Player 0. First, I'll define the three experts based on what would be most helpful for analyzing this situation. Your goal is to increase the total value of your resources, and you're now responding to Player 1's latest offer: **Offered items: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 3 Brick, 2 Ore**.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Experts\nTo provide balanced advice, I've selected three experts with distinct perspectives on trading:\n1. **Value Maximizer Expert**: Focuses purely on calculating the net gain or loss in total resource value based on your resource values (e.g., Wheat: 5, Wood: 8, Sheep: 17, Brick: 30, Ore: 40). This expert prioritizes trades that increase your overall portfolio value.\n2. **Resource Balancer Expert**: Emphasizes maintaining a balanced portfolio of resources, considering quantities and potential future needs (e.g., avoiding shortages in high-value items like Ore or Brick while not over-accumulating low-value ones like Wheat).\n3. **Risk Assessor Expert**: Evaluates the risks of the trade, such as the reliability of Player 1 based on past interactions and whether accepting could lead to long-term disadvantages, like depleting key resources.\n\nThese experts will proceed step by step:\n- Each writes one step of their thinking.\n- They share their steps with the group.\n- Then, they move to the next round of steps.\n- If an expert realizes their analysis is flawed (e.g., based on incorrect assumptions), they will leave the discussion.\n\nYour current resources for reference:\n- Wheat: 18 qty (Value: 5 each)\n- Wood: 22 qty (Value: 8 each)\n- Sheep: 23 qty (Value: 17 each)\n- Brick: 14 qty (Value: 30 each)\n- Ore: 25 qty (Value: 40 each)\n\nPlayer 1's offer: They offer 4 Sheep and 2 Wood in exchange for your 3 Brick and 2 Ore.\n\n### Round 1: First Step of Thinking\nEach expert shares their initial analysis.\n\n- **Value Maximizer Expert's Step 1**: I calculate the net value change for this trade. If you accept, you give 3 Brick (3 * 30 = 90 value) and 2 Ore (2 * 40 = 80 value), totaling 170 value given. You receive 4 Sheep (4 * 17 = 68 value) and 2 Wood (2 * 8 = 16 value), totaling 84 value received. Net loss: 170 - 84 = 86 value. This trade decreases your total value, so I advise against it.\n\n- **Resource Balancer Expert's Step 1**: I look at your current quantities and how this trade affects balance. You have plenty of Ore (25 qty) and Brick (14 qty), but accepting means losing 3 Brick and 2 Ore, reducing your high-value stockpiles. In return, you'd gain 4 Sheep (you already have 23) and 2 Wood (you have 22), which doesn't address any shortages and might lead to overstocking lower-value items. This seems unbalanced and not ideal.\n\n- **Risk Assessor Expert's Step 1**: Based on the game history, Player 1 has rejected multiple offers from you and only succeeded in trades that benefited them (e.g., their previous accepted offer gave them Brick and Wood). This offer asks for your high-value resources (Brick and Ore) while giving back lower-value ones. There's a risk Player 1 is trying to deplete your strong assets, especially since the game has only a few turns left (this is Turn 10 or close). I advise caution to avoid long-term regret.\n\n### Round 2: Second Step of Thinking\nAfter sharing, the experts refine their analysis based on the group's input.\n\n- **Value Maximizer Expert's Step 2**: Building on the others, I confirm my value calculation is accurate\u2014your total value would drop from 2077 to 1991 (original total: 18*5 + 22*8 + 23*17 + 14*30 + 25*40 = 2077; post-trade: subtract 170 and add 84). No new information changes this, so I stick with my advice to deny.\n\n- **Resource Balancer Expert's Step 2**: The Value Maximizer's numbers reinforce my concern\u2014gaining more Sheep and Wood doesn't help if you're already stocked up, and losing Brick and Ore could imbalance your portfolio for future turns. With the game ending soon, you might not recover those resources. I agree with denying this.\n\n- **Risk Assessor Expert's Step 2**: The group's analysis aligns; Player 1's pattern of offers suggests they're pushing for favorable deals. If you deny, you could counter with an offer that better suits your needs. No flaws in my reasoning, so I stay.\n\n### Round 3: Third Step of Thinking\nThe experts continue to the final step, aiming for a decision.\n\n- **Value Maximizer Expert's Step 3**: We've confirmed a net loss. To maximize value, you should deny and perhaps propose a counteroffer that ensures a gain, like offering excess Wheat or Wood for something more valuable. Final advice: Deny.\n\n- **Resource Balancer Expert's Step 3**: With consensus on the imbalance, denying makes sense. If you want to trade, focus on offers that even out quantities without losing high-value items. I have no new concerns, so I conclude here.\n\n- **Risk Assessor Expert's Step 3**: The risks outweigh benefits, and the group's math backs this up. Deny to protect your position. If you proceed, suggest a safer counteroffer. I'm confident in this.\n\n### Final Decision as Player 0\nBased on the experts' analysis, the trade would result in a net loss of value (86 points), create an imbalanced resource portfolio, and expose you to unnecessary risks from Player 1's trading patterns. Therefore, I will deny the offer.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "Below, I'll simulate the internal decision-making process as Player 0 in this Negotiation Game. My goal is to ensure that any trades I make increase the total value of my resources. First, I'll briefly outline the experts I'm consulting, as per the instructions. I've selected three types of experts who would be most helpful for analyzing this trading situation:\n\n- **Expert 1: Value Analyst** \u2013 Focuses on calculating net value gains or losses from trades, using the given resource values to ensure I'm always maximizing my total value.\n- **Expert 2: Quantity Strategist** \u2013 Considers resource quantities, potential shortages, and long-term game strategy (e.g., maintaining a balanced portfolio for future trades, given the game's 10-turn limit).\n- **Expert 3: Negotiation Tactician** \u2013 Reviews the history of offers and rejections to assess patterns, player behavior, and opportunities for counteroffers or improved negotiations.\n\nThe experts will proceed in steps: each writes one step of their thinking and shares it with the group, then they all move to the next step. If any expert realizes they're wrong, they'll leave the discussion.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Thoughts (Each Expert Shares Their First Analysis)\n- **Expert 1 (Value Analyst):** \"Player 1's offer is: They give me 10 Wheat and 2 Wood in exchange for my 2 Brick and 1 Ore. Let's calculate the values: Incoming: 10 Wheat (10 * 5 = 50) + 2 Wood (2 * 8 = 16) = 66 total. Outgoing: 2 Brick (2 * 30 = 60) + 1 Ore (1 * 40 = 40) = 100 total. This is a net loss of 100 - 66 = 34 value. We should reject this; it doesn't align with our goal of increasing total value.\"\n  \n- **Expert 2 (Quantity Strategist):** \"Looking at quantities, I'd gain 10 Wheat (I already have 18, so that's helpful for bulk but not urgent) and 2 Wood (I have 22, so it's a minor addition). But I'd lose 2 Brick (from 14, which is decent but not critical) and 1 Ore (from 25, which is abundant). This trade doesn't address any shortages and could deplete higher-value resources without clear benefits, especially with only a few turns left in the 10-turn game.\"\n\n- **Expert 3 (Negotiation Tactician):** \"From the history, Player 1 has rejected several of our offers and made counteroffers that favor them (e.g., they previously offered 4 Sheep and 1 Ore for 2 Brick and 1 Wood, which we accepted, but now they're escalating demands). This offer seems opportunistic and one-sided. We should deny it and consider a counteroffer that tests their limits, like offering something with less value loss for us.\"\n\n### Step 2: Building on Each Other's Thoughts\n- **Expert 1 (Value Analyst):** \"Building on Expert 3's point, the history shows Player 1 has been inconsistent\u2014 they've accepted trades before but rejected ours multiple times. My value calculation confirms a loss, so I'm not changing my stance. If we counteroffer, it must ensure at least a break-even or positive value. For example, we could propose giving less high-value resources.\"\n\n- **Expert 2 (Quantity Strategist):** \"Expert 1's math is solid, and Expert 3's history review makes sense. We have plenty of Ore (25 qty) and Brick (14 qty), so we could afford to trade some if it's strategic. But this offer doesn't help balance our portfolio\u2014 we're giving away valuable items without gaining something scarce. I agree we should counter with an offer that maintains or increases our quantities of high-value items.\"\n\n- **Expert 3 (Negotiation Tactician):** \"Everyone's on track. Player 1's offers have been getting more aggressive (e.g., demanding more Brick and Ore while offering Wheat and Wood, which are lower-value). A counteroffer could reset the dynamic. We should propose something where we give Wood (which we have in abundance) and maybe a bit of Sheep in exchange for their Wheat, keeping our net value positive.\"\n\n### Step 3: Final Consensus and Conclusion\n- **Expert 1 (Value Analyst):** \"After reviewing the group's input, my analysis holds\u2014 this trade is a loss. No new information changes that. I'm confident in rejecting and countering with a value-positive offer.\"\n\n- **Expert 2 (Quantity Strategist):** \"Agreed. This doesn't improve our quantities meaningfully. Let's move to a counteroffer that aligns with our resources.\"\n\n- **Expert 3 (Negotiation Tactician):** \"Solid points all around. Time to act based on this.\"\n\nAll experts remain, as none have realized they're wrong.\n\n### My Decision as Player 0\nBased on the experts' analysis, Player 1's offer results in a net value loss for me (losing 100 value for 66), so I will reject it. However, to advance the game and potentially negotiate a better deal, I'll make a counteroffer. I'll propose trading some of my abundant Wood and Sheep (lower relative value to me) for their Wheat and Wood, ensuring the trade is value-positive for me.\n\nSpecifically, I'll offer: 5 Wood and 3 Sheep (my outgoing value: 5 * 8 = 40 + 3 * 17 = 51, total 91) in exchange for 10 Wheat and 1 Wood (incoming value: 10 * 5 = 50 + 1 * 8 = 8, total 58). Wait, that still results in a net loss (91 outgoing vs. 58 incoming). Let me adjust for a positive value: Offer 3 Wood and 2 Sheep (outgoing: 3 * 8 = 24 + 2 * 17 = 34, total 58) for 8 Wheat (incoming: 8 * 5 = 40). Net gain: 40 - 58 = -18 (still a loss). Correction\u2014 I need to flip it for a gain. Final adjusted offer: Offer 4 Sheep (outgoing: 4 * 17 = 68) for 12 Wheat (incoming: 12 * 5 = 60). That's a loss. Hold\u2014 recalculating properly for a gain: Offer 3 Wood (outgoing: 3 * 8 = 24) for 5 Wheat (incoming: 5 * 5 = 25). Net loss of 1. To make it positive: Offer 2 Wood (outgoing: 2 * 8 = 16) for 4 Wheat (incoming: 4 * 5 = 20). Net gain of 4.\n\nFinal counteroffer: [Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 4 Wheat, 1 Wood]\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 4 Wheat, 1 Wood]",
