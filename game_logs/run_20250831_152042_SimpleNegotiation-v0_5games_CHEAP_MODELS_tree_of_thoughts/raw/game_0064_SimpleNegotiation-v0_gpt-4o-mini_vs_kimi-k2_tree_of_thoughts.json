      "response": "Let's create three different trading experts, each with a unique approach to trading, who will contribute their perspectives as we navigate the negotiation process.\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Maximizer\nThis expert focuses on maximizing the total value of resources by aiming to trade for high-value items.\n\n**Step 1:**\nThe Value Maximizer sees that Ore has the highest individual value among the resources. They suggest holding onto Ore and looking for trades that can enhance overall value without losing high-value resources.\n\n**Step 2:**\nThey analyze potential trades and realize that while Brick is valuable, they could acquire more through a strategic offer. They propose:\n[Offer: 5 Ore -> 8 Brick]\nThe aim is to gain a substantial amount of high-value Brick.\n\n---\n\n### Expert 2: The Risk Manager\nThis expert carefully weighs the risks of trading away valuable resources against the potential benefits.\n\n**Step 1:**\nThe Risk Manager focuses on maintaining a balanced resource portfolio. They point out that Wood is currently overabundant, suggesting it could be a trade option.\n\n**Step 2:**\nThey analyze for feasible trades without significantly depleting risky resources. Their proposed trade is:\n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 3 Wheat, 3 Brick] \nThis way, they trade less valuable resources for mid-range value items while maintaining a strong base.\n\n---\n\n### Expert 3: The Experimental Trader\nThis expert takes a creative approach, willing to explore unconventional trades that may lead to unexpected benefits.\n\n**Step 1:**\nThe Experimental Trader senses opportunities for trading low-value items in bulk for higher-value ones. They recognize that Sheep can be traded for items that hold long-term value.\n\n**Step 2:**\nThey propose the following trade, believing in the potential long-term benefits:\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 4 Ore, 1 Brick] \nThis could enhance the resource pool significantly, considering the high value of Ore.\n\n---\n\n### Collaborative Decision\nNow that all experts have presented their initial thoughts, they convene to assess and combine ideas.\n\n**Step 3: Joint Analysis**\n- The Value Maximizer believes the initial proposal for Brick trades is lucrative.\n- The Risk Manager confirms moderate trading is safer and more prudent.\n- The Experimental Trader is enthusiastic about the prospect of trading Sheep for Ore.\n\n**Step 4: Decision Making**\nConsidering all perspectives, they might decide to pursue the proposal that balances value and resource risk.\n \nAs Player 0, I would initiate the following action based on the strongest insights:\n\n1. **Propose Trade**: \n   [Offer: 10 Wood -> 3 Wheat, 3 Brick]\n\nNow, let's see how the game progresses over the next turns with feedback and response based on counters from other players and potential deals open to explore. The first trade goes ahead, and I will assess incoming offers in the subsequent rounds based on whether they improve my overall resource value.",

      "response": "### Initial Analysis of the Current Offer\n\n**Current Offer from Player 0: 5 Ore \u2192 8 Brick**\n\nLet's evaluate this offer based on the values:\n\n- **Ore Value**: 36 per unit. Giving away 5 Ore means a loss of 5 * 36 = 180 total value.\n- **Brick Value**: 24 per unit. Receiving 8 Brick means a gain of 8 * 24 = 192 total value.\n\nNet change in total value: 192 (gain) - 180 (loss) = +12 value.\n\nAt face value, this seems like a positive trade (+12 total value for me). However, we need to consider if this is the best possible trade or if we can negotiate for better terms.\n\n### Expert Roles and Their Perspectives\n\nTo make the best decision, let's consider three types of experts:\n\n1. **Resource Value Analyst**: Focuses on the numerical value and scarcity of resources.\n2. **Strategic Trader**: Considers future trades and negotiation leverage.\n3. **Opportunistic Evaluator**: Looks for immediate gains and potential counteroffers.\n\nLet's have each expert provide their step-by-step thoughts.\n\n---\n\n#### Expert 1: Resource Value Analyst\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate the current values and quantities.**\n- I have 16 Ore (high value, high quantity) and 10 Brick (moderate value, low quantity).\n- Giving away 5 Ore reduces Ore to 11, receiving 8 Brick increases Brick to 18.\n- Ore is my highest-value resource, but I have a good quantity. Brick is lower in quantity, so this trade helps balance my portfolio.\n\n**Step 2: Check the efficiency of the trade.**\n- The exchange rate is 5 Ore for 8 Brick, or 1 Ore : 1.6 Brick.\n- My internal value ratio is Ore: 36, Brick: 24, so 36/24 = 1.5 Brick per Ore.\n- The trade gives 1.6 Brick per Ore, which is slightly above my internal ratio. This is favorable.\n\n**Step 3: Consider marginal utility.**\n- Losing 5 Ore doesn't hurt much since I have 16 and high value.\n- Gaining 8 Brick is significant since I only have 10.\n\n**Conclusion**: The trade is numerically favorable, but let's see if others have insights.\n\n---\n\n#### Expert 2: Strategic Trader\n\n**Step 1: Assess negotiation leverage.**\n- Player 0 is offering Ore for Brick. They might need Brick more than Ore, or have excess Ore.\n- Their offer is slightly favorable to me (+12), so maybe they're trying to entice me to accept quickly.\n\n**Step 2: Consider future trades.**\n- If I accept this, I might not have as much Ore to trade later, but I'll have more Brick.\n- Ore is generally more versatile (higher value), so holding onto Ore might give better future trades.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate counteroffer potential.**\n- Maybe I can ask for more Brick or fewer Ore given. For example, could I counter with 4 Ore for 8 Brick?\n\n**Conclusion**: The current offer is okay, but I might be able to squeeze more value by countering.\n\n---\n\n#### Expert 3: Opportunistic Evaluator\n\n**Step 1: Look for immediate gains.**\n- The trade gives +12 value immediately. Not huge, but positive.\n- I don't see any other offers on the table right now, so this is the only immediate opportunity.\n\n**Step 2: Consider risk of denial.**\n- If I deny, Player 0 might adjust their offer to be worse (like 5 Ore for 7 Brick) or stop offering.\n- Alternatively, they might accept a counteroffer if I make one quickly.\n\n**Step 3: Act quickly but smartly.**\n- Since the trade is positive, but not amazing, a slight counteroffer might be worth it without risking the deal.\n\n**Conclusion**: Counteroffer to improve the deal slightly, but don't push too hard.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesizing the Experts' Views\n\n- The **Resource Value Analyst** says the trade is mathematically favorable.\n- The **Strategic Trader** suggests I might get better terms with a counteroffer.\n- The **Opportunistic Evaluator** warns against being too greedy but sees room for slight improvement.\n\n### Best Action: Make a Counteroffer\n\nGiven the slight favorability, a counteroffer adjusting the terms slightly more in my favor seems optimal. \n\nPossible counter: Instead of 5 Ore for 8 Brick, propose **4 Ore for 8 Brick**. This would be:\n- Loss: 4 * 36 = 144 value.\n- Gain: 8 * 24 = 192 value.\n- Net: +48 value (better than +12).\n\nThis is a reasonable ask: 4 Ore for 8 Brick is still 1 Ore : 2 Brick, which is above my internal 1 Ore : 1.5 Brick ratio, and Player 0 might accept since they initiated Ore for Brick.\n\n### Final Response\n\nI will make the following counteroffer to Player 0:\n\n[Offer: 4 Ore -> 8 Brick]",

      "response": "Let's analyze the situation with three different types of experts: \n\n1. **Economist Expert** - This expert focuses on the value of resources and maximizes potential gains.\n2. **Risk Management Expert** - This expert evaluates trade offers based on the risk of loss and potential reward.\n3. **Negotiation Strategy Expert** - This expert emphasizes negotiation tactics and how to create mutually beneficial offers.\n\n### Turn Analysis\n\n1. **Economist Expert**\n   - **Current Values**: \n     - Wheat: 6\n     - Wood: 9\n     - Sheep: 13\n     - Brick: 20\n     - Ore: 32\n   - **Analysis**: Resources are worth their value based on quantity, and Ore has a high value. Since I need Brick and Player 1 has rejected my initial offer of Ore for Brick, I need to consider Player 1's current hold on Brick. Accepting Player 1's offer of 4 Ore for 8 Brick seems suboptimal, considering the total value of the Ore I am losing (32 value) for 8 Brick (160 value, but with the understanding that Brick is less valuable in terms of quantity per trade).\n   \n   **Next Step**: Consider a counter-offer or acknowledge the rejection.\n\n2. **Risk Management Expert**\n   - **Current Situation**: I've already attempted a trade that didn't succeed and am now considering Player 1's offer.\n   - **Risk Evaluation**: Gaining Brick may provide a competitive advantage, but I am exchanging high-value Ore for what I perceive as lower value in Brick. If I accept this trade, I'll need to analyze future trades carefully to mitigate the potential risk of having fewer Ore.\n   \n   **Next Step**: Make a counter-offer that involves a lower risk, maybe offering fewer Ore for more Brick or a combination that still retains some Ore value.\n\n3. **Negotiation Strategy Expert**\n   - **Current Situation**: I've initiated the negotiation, and Player 1 declined. They are now offering resources.\n   - **Negotiation Tactics**: Since Player 1 rejected my 5 Ore for 8 Brick offer, it suggests that they may feel they could get a better deal or that they are valuing Brick highly. If I can increase my negotiation finesse, perhaps I can entice them with a different combination. \n   \n   **Next Step**: Counter-offer differently, possibly integrating different resources that could intrigue them more and facilitate a better balance of value.\n\n### Conclusion:\nI will make an offer while considering each expert's feedback. Here's my counter-offer:\n\n**Counter-Offer**: [Offer: 6 Ore -> 10 Brick] \n\nThis balances my current high-value resource and increases the chances Player 1 may accept a greater quantity of Brick!",

This gives us the marginal value of each item:\n- Wheat: 6/21 = 0.29 per unit\n- Wood: 9/19 = 0.47 per unit  \n- Sheep: 15/7 = 2.14 per unit\n- Brick: 24/10 = 2.40 per unit\n- Ore: 36/16 = 2.25 per unit\n\n**Negotiation Strategist (Step 1)**: Looking at the trade history, Player 0 is heavily focused on obtaining Brick, offering multiple Ore for Brick trades. They seem desperate for Brick, suggesting Brick is undervalued in their eyes or they're close to completing a set. Their latest offer: 2 Ore (4.50) + 3 Sheep (6.42) = 10.92 total value for 5 Brick (12.00) + 2 Wood (0.94) = 12.94. This is actually favorable to us by 2.02 in face value.\n\n**Portfolio Optimizer (Step 1)**: Our current portfolio is heavily weighted toward Ore (57.1% of total value) and we have Brick as our second highest at 10 units. We might benefit from acquiring more diversified lower-value resources while maintaining our Ore advantage.\n\n---\n\n### Turn 1 Strategy:\n\nBased on their combined analysis, I'll make a counter-offer that both exploits Player 0's evident Brick shortage and improves our value:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Wood]",

      "response": "To analyze the trading situation effectively, I\u2019ll employ three different trading experts to provide unique perspectives. Each expert will consider the current resources, the trading offers made, and the potential value of the trades.\n\n### Expert 1: The Resource Maximizer\nFocuses on maximizing value based on current resources and trade offers.\n\n- Current Resources Total Value Calculation:\n  - Wheat: 6 * 6 = 36\n  - Wood: 22 * 9 = 198\n  - Sheep: 10 * 13 = 130\n  - Brick: 15 * 20 = 300\n  - Ore: 23 * 32 = 736\n  - Total Value: 36 + 198 + 130 + 300 + 736 = 1400\n\n- Evaluating Incoming Offer from Player 1: \n  - Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore for 5 Brick, 2 Wood\n  - Resource Values After Transaction if Accepted:\n    - Sheep: (10 - 3) = 7 remaining, Value = 7 * 13 = 91\n    - Ore: (23 - 2) = 21 remaining, Value = 21 * 32 = 672\n    - Brick: (15 + 5) = 20 total, Value = 20 * 20 = 400\n    - Wood: (22 + 2) = 24 total, Value = 24 * 9 = 216\n    - New Total Value: 91 + 672 + 400 + 216 = 1379\n\n- Conclusion: The Trade would result in a decrease in total value from 1400 to 1379. **[Deny]**\n\n### Expert 2: The Strategic Trader\nLooks for trades that could lead to better offers in the future.\n\n- Current Value Assessment:\n  - High-value resources (Ore and Brick) are vital for potential trades.\n  - The goal is to trade for resources that can be turned into higher value later.\n\n- Evaluating Incoming Offer:\n  - The offer from Player 1 exchanges 5 Brick (high value) for 3 Sheep and 2 Ore (lower value).\n  - However, accepting this trade could mean having two fewer Ore, which might be critical for future trades.\n\n- Future Outlook:\n  - Assessing future opportunities: Brick might have stable demand; it's essential to keep a significant quantity.\n- Conclusion: The strategic potential of the current resources suggests a denial. **[Deny]**\n\n### Expert 3: The Opportunist\nFocuses on individual trades and the immediate benefits from them.\n\n- Current Resource Valuation:\n  - Players are underestimating the value exchange properties of resources like Brick and Ore.\n\n- Upcoming offer assessment:\n  - The offer includes 5 Brick, which could be useful for future trades. Accepting may create trade opportunities with others who need Brick or additional resources.\n  \n- Opportunity for Future Trades:\n  - By acquiring 5 Brick, Player 0 can leverage them for potentially more valuable trades going forward.\n\n- Conclusion: Although the trade appears less favorable initially, the brick could be a critical game element for future negotiations. **[Accept]**\n\n### Summary of Expert Opinions:\n1. Resource Maximizer: **[Deny]**\n2. Strategic Trader: **[Deny]**\n3. Opportunist: **[Accept]**\n\nGiven mixed opinions, the most prudent action considering the expert strategies would be to initially **[Deny]** for immediate resource value retention but remain open to renegotiation based on further assessment of Player 1\u2019s offers in subsequent turns.",

I don\u2019t want to give away more Sheep, but Brick and Ore still dominate total value.\u201d  \n\nBuilder: \u201cWatching the pattern of brick-for-ore exchanges, I think Player 0 is bottlenecked on Brick. I can still lose some Ore (504 \u2192 450 range) if the return secures scarce Sheep or Wood with nice ratios, but I\u2019d rather gain cheap Wheat (6 value) or Sheep (15) without dumping Ore.\u201d  \n\nScarcity Hunter: \u201cWe sit on 14 Ore, highly over-supplied. Player 0 currently holds only 5 Ore left while risking Brick starvation.  Let me propose an Ore-heavy flip that still respects the 15 : 24 Ore : Brick market ratio (~5 : 8).\u201d\n\nStep 2  \nValue Analyst: \u201cIf we offer 4 Ore (144 value) for 2 Sheep (30 value) that\u2019s way off.  Try 6 Ore for 3 Sheep to keep 2 : 1 Ore : Sheep, giving up 216 value, receiving 45: lossy.  Re-check yields: better may be to send 4 Ore for 5 Wheat (30 value) and 1 Wood (9 value) but wheat is low-value.  Any positive or break-even Ore dump is risky\u2014the lone goal is a small brick gain without depleting Sheep.\u201d  \n\nBuilder: \u201cStill, my roadmap wants more Wheat and Wood; Brick already sky-high. Instead ofoffering premium Sheep value away, I\u2019d test getting 4 Wheat + 4 Wood for a moderate Ore slice:  Offer 4 Ore for 4 Wheat (24) + 4 Wood (36) \u2192 60 value received versus 144 given\u2014nope, too steep.  Scale expectations.\u201d  \n\nScarcity Hunter: \u201cAutosweep: give minimum Ore that Player 0 cannot refuse because they\u2019re ore-starved.  Tightest: 3 Ore dispenses 108 value; ask 2 Brick 48 + 2 Wheat 12.  Net gain brick-heavy but I still pick up wheat safety.  Fair?  Probably not to them.  Push envelope: my next offer must be 4 Ore for 5 Brick \u2192 same ratio we just received:  Ore:Brick = 4:5 \u2192 check history, rejected the 5 for 8 counter-offer once, but player lost 6 for 10 too.  Additional bait a small Sheep sweetener?\u201d\n\nStep 3  \nValue Analyst: \u201cLet\u2019s lock the ratios: Ore : Brick market is 1 : 1.5 avg.  If I send 4 Ore (144) I can rightly ask 6 Brick (144) straight exchange or a small surplus.

      "response": "Let's proceed with the trading decision using the perspectives of three different types of experts: a Resource Analyst, a Negotiation Tactician, and a Market Strategist.\n\n### Expert Analysis\n\n**1. Resource Analyst**  \n- The Resource Analyst looks at the current inventory and evaluates the value of the resources.  \n- Given the trade from Player 1, the offer is: 4 Ore for 6 Brick.\n- Current resources after accepted offer from Player 1:\n  - Wheat: 6 Value: 6\n  - Wood: 22 Value: 9\n  - Sheep: 7 (after giving away 3) Value: 9.1 \n  - Brick: 5 (after gaining 5) Value: 10\n  - Ore: 19 (after giving away 2) Value: 25  \n- The analyst notes that Brick is worth more in terms of immediate value relative to Ore.  \n- Strategy: Accept the new offer as it increases total inventory value.\n\n**2. Negotiation Tactician**  \n- The Negotiation Tactician focuses on maximizing future bargaining power.  \n- Analyzing the trade dynamics, Player 1 has consistently valued Brick highly and is willing to give multiple Ore for it.\n- Accepting 4 Ore for 6 Brick can enhance Player 0's bargaining position, as having more Brick opens further trade options with other players.\n- However, future negotiations may require maintaining a balance of Ore.  \n- Strategy: Accept the current offer to shift resources favorably and prepare for future trades with stronger bargaining chips.\n\n**3. Market Strategist**  \n- The Market Strategist evaluates trends in resource value based on potential future trades.  \n- High demand for Brick means that Player 1 will likely continue offering Ore for it. This may decrease once Player 0 has more Brick.\n- Accepting 4 Ore for 6 Brick seems beneficial, as it maintains Player 0\u2019s resource efficiency. \n- The market view suggests that Brick may continue to command a favorable exchange rate, making its acquisition worthwhile.  \n- Strategy: Accept the offer while keeping an eye on Player 1\u2019s upcoming trades.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the analysis from all three experts, the best course of action is to:\n\n**[Accept]** the offer from Player 1 (4 Ore for 6 Brick). \n\nThis decision increases total value while positioning Player 0 favorably for future negotiations.",

End-Game Strategist  \n\n---- Turn 9: Begin Expert Analysis ----\n\nStep 1 \u2013 first impressions  \nResource-Value Analyst: \u201cCurrent total value = 1 826  (21\u00d76 + 19\u00d79 + 7\u00d715 + 10\u00d724 + 16\u00d736).  \nAfter the last two accepted trades we have: \u00bb  \nWheat 21, Wood 21, Sheep 4, Brick 3, Ore 10 \u00ab. New value = 21\u00d76 + 21\u00d79 + 4\u00d715 + 3\u00d724 + 10\u00d736 = 1 413 \u2013 a loss of 413.  \nOur newest holdings show that our scarcest goods are Brick (value 24 per unit) and Sheep (15). The richest goods we still hold in large absolute number are Ore (10 left) and Wheat (21). Tactically, we need to keep only enough Ore so its marginal utility is still above that of what we buy.\u201d  \n\nAcute Bargainer: \u201cI note that Player 0 keeps pressing us for Brick but has just now accepted two trades that drained 11 Brick out of their own stock (net 10 B to P0), so they must be nearly Brick-tapped as well (max 2\u20133 Brick left). Player 0 also just received 6 Ore in the last exchange. This implies that freshly-returned Ore is Player 0\u2019s preferred medium right now. We can exploit a new favor-decoy offer: we surrender the surplus Wheat and some minimalist Ore units to get back that diminishing Brick stock.\u201d\n\nEnd-Game Strategist: \u201cOnly one turn left. We cannot afford any \u2018net-loss\u2019 deal again; we have at most one simultaneous counter-offer permitted. Our goal is a last-second upgrade of Brick and/or Sheep so our closing portfolio value beats 1 413 (already below starting 1 826, but must salvage). A simple 2-or-3 Brick addition offsets the earlier 4-value Sheep downgrade we accepted.\u201d\n\nStep 2 \u2013 specifics  \nResource-Value Analyst: \u201cTo record a net surplus on this final exchange while P0 still craves Ore:  \nCase A \u2013 Offer 3 Ore for 4 Brick \u2192 Value change:+48 (3\u00d736->4\u00d724)  \nCase B \u2013 Offer 2 Ore + 2 Wheat for 5 Brick \u2192 Value change:+60 (offset Wheat\u2019s low value)  \nBoth satisfy \u201cfinal trade break-even or profit\u201d gap; but Case B slightly higher.\u201d\n\nAcute Bargainer: \u201cPlayer 0\u2019s Ore on hand \u224810\u201311, so a small Ore giveaway still aligned with their prior behavior. I co-sign Case A because asking 5 Brick may be rejected if Player 0 holds \u22644 Brick. I wrap it into a round packet: 3 Ore for precisely 4 Brick so the deal looks clean.\u201d\n\nEnd-Game Strategist: \u201cSimpler terms give highest closing certainty. Consolidate on one unambiguous trade: surplus lowest-marginal-utility Ore (36) for highest-deficit Brick (24). Any extra is a play left on the table. I agree to analyst idea only trimmed to 3->4.\u201d\n\nStep 3 \u2013 finalize the statement  \nResource-Value Analyst: \u201cOur final portfolio with the 3\u21c44 exchange would read: Wheat 21, Wood 21, Sheep 4, Brick 7, Ore 7, value = 21\u00d76 + 21\u00d79 + 4\u00d715 + 7\u00d724 + 7\u00d736 = 1 545.

      "response": "### Expert Analyses\n\n**Expert 1: Resource Maximization Expert**\n- **Step 1**: Analyze the current resources and their overall value. The values of my resources are:\n  - Wheat (Qty: 6, Value: 6)\n  - Wood (Qty: 22, Value: 9)\n  - Sheep (Qty: 7 after accepting offer from Player 1, Value: 10.2)\n  - Brick (Qty: 5 after accepting offer from Player 1, Value: 10)\n  - Ore (Qty: 21 after accepting offer from Player 1, Value: 30)\n  \n  Current total value before trades: \\( 6 + 9 + 10.2 + 10 + 30 = 65.2 \\)\n\n- **Step 2**: Evaluate potential trades based on resource values. Since Brick and Ore have higher values, I should focus on acquiring more Brick while trying to offload excess Ore.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 2: Strategic Negotiation Expert**\n- **Step 1**: Focus on assessing Player 1\u2019s tendencies. Player 1 seems to value Brick highly and is willing to trade Ore. Analyzing earlier offers shows that Player 1 prefers trades where they can secure Brick at a favorable ratio. \n\n- **Step 2**: Calculate direct trades that would benefit both and look into proposing a better deal utilizing both my remaining Ore and Sheep to see if I can get close to 8 Brick without giving away too much Ore.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 3: Market Trends Expert**\n- **Step 1**: Look at the broader market trends. Given that brick is in high demand, I should focus on acquisitions that leverage my high quantity of Ore. Each trade has not yielded a significant gain thus far, so I need to ensure the next negotiation highlights the scarcity of Brick versus the abundance of Ore.\n\n- **Step 2**: Explore the idea of trading my Sheep for additional resources but limit the amount of Ore offered, trying for high-quality trades rather than quantity.\n\n---\n\n### Current Situation\n\nAfter considering my next moves:\n\n1. I have a good quantity of Ore but lack in Brick which is valuable for early game dominance.\n2. I\u2019ve accepted an offer from Player 1 concerning Ore and Sheep for Brick and Wood, which is a start, but I'll need to strategize my next offer.\n\n---\n\n**Action**:\nI will move to create a new proposal:\n\n\u201cI will offer [Offer: 2 Ore, 5 Wood -> 8 Brick] to Player 1. This way, I can leverage my excess Wood while offloading some Ore to increase my Brick stock.\u201d\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds.",
