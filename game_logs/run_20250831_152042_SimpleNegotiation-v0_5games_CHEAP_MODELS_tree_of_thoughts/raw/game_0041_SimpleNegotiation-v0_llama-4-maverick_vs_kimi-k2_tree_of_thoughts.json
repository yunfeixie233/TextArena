We have a lot of Ore (Value: 32) and Brick (Value: 30), which are quite valuable. We should look to trade less valuable resources for more of these or equally valuable ones.\"\n   \n2. **Supply and Demand Analyst**: \"In most trading scenarios, the demand for resources like Ore and Brick is usually high because of their value. We should leverage this by offering less valuable resources in exchange for more Ore or Brick if possible.\"\n\n3. **Risk Management Specialist**: \"Before making any trades, we should consider the risk of receiving resources that might not be as valuable as we anticipate. Let's aim for trades that are likely to be beneficial or at least neutral in the worst-case scenario.\"\n\n#### Proposed Action for Turn 1\n\nGiven the experts' initial thoughts, a potential trade could involve offering resources of lower value in exchange for those of higher value. For instance, offering some Wood (Value: 11) or Sheep (Value: 12) for more Brick (Value: 30) or Ore (Value: 32) could be beneficial.\n\n**Action for Turn 1**: `[Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]`\n\nThis trade aims to exchange less valuable resources (Wood and Sheep) for more valuable ones (Brick and Ore), potentially increasing the total value.\n\nLet's execute this action and see how the game unfolds.\n\n**Action**: `[Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]`",

      "response": "To tackle this task effectively, I will assemble a team of three diverse trading experts: an Economist, a Strategist, and a Statistician. Each expert will analyze the given situation from their unique perspective, and they will collaborate by sharing their thoughts step-by-step.\n\n### Turn 1 Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Initial Assessment**\n\n1. **Economist**: The current resource distribution and values are as follows: Wheat (6, 6), Wood (20, 11), Sheep (23, 12), Brick (15, 30), and Ore (22, 32). We should identify resources with lower values that can be traded for those with higher values. Our initial offer to Player 1 was 5 Wood (Value: 2.75 per unit, total value 11*5/20 = 13.75, but we value it at 5.5) and 3 Sheep (Value: 12/23 per unit, total value 3*12/23 = 1.57*3 = 4.71, approximately, for 2 Brick (Value: 2*30/15 = 4) and 1 Ore (Value: 32/22 = 1.45). The offer was rejected. Our next step should be to re-evaluate the rejected trade and consider adjustments.\n\n2. **Strategist**: The rejection by Player 1 indicates they either have sufficient Brick and Ore or value Wood and Sheep less than we do relative to Brick and Ore. We should consider what we can deduce about Player 1's resources and needs. Perhaps they have a surplus of Brick or Ore, or maybe they're conserving Wood and Sheep. We should think about making a different offer, possibly involving resources we have in abundance relative to their value.\n\n3. **Statistician**: Let's analyze the probability of a successful trade based on past interactions and resource distributions. Assuming historical data is available, we can model the likelihood of acceptance based on resource ratios and values. However, without specific data on Player 1's past trades or current resource state, we'll have to base our next move on the current offer's characteristics and the feedback (rejection) received.\n\n**Shared Thoughts and Next Steps**: \n- The Economist suggests re-evaluating our initial offer and adjusting it based on resource values and potential gains.\n- The Strategist recommends considering Player 1's potential resource state and adjusting our offer to better align with their likely needs or surpluses.\n- The Statistician proposes that, without historical data, we should focus on the qualitative aspects of the trade, such as the relative value of the resources.\n\n### Decision for Turn 1\n\nGiven the rejection, let's adjust our strategy. One potential trade could be: `[Offer: 4 Wheat, 4 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Ore]`. This offer involves resources of relatively lower value (Wheat and Sheep) and requests resources of higher value (Brick and Ore), potentially making it more appealing.\n\nAction: `[Offer: 4 Wheat, 4 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's proceed to Turn 2, awaiting Player 1's response to our new offer.",

That\u2019s bad balance planning. Accepting them would exacerbate shortage of high-value Ore/Brick while stuffing us with low-to-mid value surplus goods.  \n\nConclusion (Step 1): Reject both; look for offers that move in the opposite direction (i.e., we want to give away Wood/Sheep/Wheat in exchange for Brick or Ore).\n\nMember 3 \u2013 Tactical Trader  \nStep 1: Project the opponent\u2019s hidden incentives.  \nPlayer 0 keeps offering the same pattern: \u201cgive me Brick + Ore, give you Sheep/Wood.\u201d  \nThey apparently want to load up on Brick/Ore. We should demand premium\u2014because they revealed scarcity.  \n\nProposed tweak:  \nWe counter-offer the reverse direction:  \n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick, 1 Ore]. This is strictly worse for Player 0 than their last bid, but still slightly worse for us in terms of strict dollar value, so Player 0 will likely deny. Next round we increment up until they bite or until the differential is in our favor. Tactical trader\u2019s plan:  \n1. Offer slightly unfavorable but symmetrical trade.  \n2. If rejected, inch toward balance by +1 Brick or +1 Ore.  \n3. Stop when net-value is \u2265 +10 to Player 1 (margin above prior offers).  \n\nConsensus & Immediate Action  \nMembers 2 and 3 overrule Member 1\u2019s strict valuation. The proper path is to reject the second offer (Offer 2) and propose a reverse flow that improves Brick + Ore.  \n\nTurn 3 Action:  \n[Deny]",

The experts I've chosen are: \n\n1. **Resource Valuator**: Focuses on the intrinsic value of the resources and potential trades based on the given values.\n2. **Game Theorist**: Analyzes the situation from a game theory perspective, considering the potential moves and counter-moves of other players.\n3. **Trading Historian**: Examines the history of trades and interactions with Player 1 to identify patterns or clues for future trades.\n\n### Initial Situation:\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 6, Value: 6\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 20, Value: 11\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 23, Value: 12\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 15, Value: 30\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 22, Value: 32\n\n### Turn 1 Analysis:\n\n1. **Resource Valuator**: Let's analyze the current resource values. We have a total value of (6*6) + (20*11) + (23*12) + (15*30) + (22*32) = 36 + 220 + 276 + 450 + 704 = 1686. Our previous offers were rejected, indicating we might not be offering a good deal. Let's consider what we can offer or request to increase our total value. We should look for opportunities to trade low-value resources for high-value ones.\n\n2. **Game Theorist**: Player 1 has rejected our offers, indicating they might have a different valuation or need for resources. We should consider what resources Player 1 might be looking to acquire or maintain. Since they haven't made a counteroffer, they might be waiting for us to improve our offer or might not be interested in trading at the moment.\n\n3. **Trading Historian**: We've made two offers to Player 1, both of which were rejected. The first was for 5 Wood and 3 Sheep in exchange for 2 Brick and 1 Ore, and the second was for 4 Wheat and 4 Sheep for 3 Brick and 1 Ore. Player 1 hasn't made any offers. This suggests we should either change our offer significantly or consider trading with other players if possible.\n\n### Turn 1 Action:\nGiven the analysis, let's adjust our strategy. We need to make a new offer that is more appealing. Let's analyze potential trades.\n\n- **Resource Valuator**: Suggests evaluating the last offer's value. The second offer involved giving 4 Wheat (4*6=24) and 4 Sheep (4*12=48), totaling 72, for 3 Brick (3*30=90) and 1 Ore (1*32=32), totaling 122. This is a gain of 50. However, it was rejected.\n\n- **Game Theorist**: Recommends considering what Player 1 might want. If they're not responding, maybe they're looking for something we haven't offered.\n\n- **Trading Historian**: Notes that our previous offers were too similar and suggests diversifying the offer.\n\nLet's make a new offer: `[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Ore]`. This involves giving up 6 Wheat (6*6=36) for 2 Ore (2*32=64), gaining 28 in value.\n\n### Action:\n`[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Ore]`\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next turn.",

Opportunity-Cost Skeptic (\u0398C) \u2013 focuses on what Player 0 is *really* acquiring and why their offers keep coming back to the same goods.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013  \nRound-1: Initial impressions  \n\u03a6V: \u201cRight now Player 1\u2019s lowest per-unit value items are Wheat (6/1 = 6). Every other item provides more than twice that. Any deal that rids us of Wheat while netting more total value is upside.\u201d  \n\n\u03a1B: \u201cThe balance is strongly skewed toward Brick (29 value) and Ore (39 value). I worry that clumping too much value in the highest-priced goods lowers liquid flexibility. Exchanging some Brick or Ore for *equal or better* composite value in other resources may smooth the curve\u2014especially if it is on favorable terms.\u201d  \n\n\u0398C: \u201cNotice Player 0 keeps asking for Brick and/or Ore. They re-offered Wood-Sheep for Brick-Ore (first offer) and Wheat-Sheep for Brick-Ore (second offer). Their newest offer, 6 Wheat for 2 Ore, is the gentlest yet: only 2 Ore leaving us, none of our over-supplied Brick. That\u2019s the lowest request so far.\u201d  \n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013  \nRound-2: Quantify the best available outgoing deal  \n\u03a6V: \u201c6 Wheat at 6 value each \u2192 36 value out. 2 Ore at 39 each \u2192 78 value in. Net delta = \u201336 + 78 = +42 value, all while dumping our worst-per-unit resource.\u201d  \n\n\u03a1B: \u201cThat deal keeps every Brick and barely dents our Ore pile (12 \u2192 10). Meanwhile we acquire Wheat we\u2019d never choose at 6, raising the question: what can we do with 6 more Wheat that\u2019s *worth more*?\u201d  \n\n\u0398C: \u201cThe larger pattern is that Player 0 is trying to accumulate Ore & Brick. If we give them two Ore now, they become ore-heavier while we stay brick-heavier. That *might* unlock future trades where they want Brick later\u2014we could recoup Ore at a premium.\u201d  \n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013  \nRound-3: Decide  \n\n\u03a6V: \u201cSimple arithmetic: +42 value with one click.

      "response": "To tackle this task effectively, let's first understand the current situation and the goal. The goal is to increase the total value of the resources held by Player 0 through trading. Initially, Player 0 has:\n- Wheat: 6 units, Value: 6\n- Wood: 20 units, Value: 11\n- Sheep: 23 units, Value: 12\n- Brick: 15 units, Value: 30\n- Ore: 22 units, Value: 32\n\nTotal initial value = (6*1) + (20*0.55) + (23*0.52) + (15*2) + (22*1.45) = 6 + 11 + 12 + 30 + 32 = 91\n\nAfter the trades and interactions in the previous turns:\n1. Player 0 offered 5 Wood, 3 Sheep for 2 Brick, 1 Ore to Player 1, which was rejected.\n2. Player 0 offered 4 Wheat, 4 Sheep for 3 Brick, 1 Ore to Player 1, which was rejected.\n3. Player 0 offered 6 Wheat for 2 Ore to Player 1, which was accepted.\n\nLet's analyze the last accepted trade: \n- Player 0 gave away 6 Wheat (Value: 6) and received 2 Ore (Value: 1.45 each).\n- So, Player 0 gave away 6 and received 2*1.45 = 2.9.\n\nCurrent holdings after the last trade:\n- Wheat: 0 units (gave away 6)\n- Wood: 20 units\n- Sheep: 23 units\n- Brick: 15 units\n- Ore: 24 units (received 2)\n\nLet's recalculate the total value:\n- Wood: 20 * 0.55 = 11\n- Sheep: 23 * 0.52 = 12\n- Brick: 15 * 2 = 30\n- Ore: 24 * 1.45 = 34.8\n\nTotal value = 11 + 12 + 30 + 34.8 = 87.8\n\nIt seems there was a decrease in total value due to the last trade (from 91 to 87.8), primarily because the trade involved giving away Wheat (value = 6) for Ore (value = 2.9). However, we should focus on the current situation and plan for the next turns.\n\nLet's have three different trading experts analyze the situation.\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Optimizer\n\"The current total value is 87.8. We should look to trade resources that are undervalued or less needed for resources that are more valuable. We have an abundance of Sheep and Wood relative to their value. Let's consider trading some of these for Brick or maintaining our Ore levels.\"\n\n### Expert 2: The Resource Balancer\n\"After the last trade, we have 0 Wheat, which might limit our future trading options, especially if we need to offer Wheat. We should think about balancing our resources. Perhaps we can trade some of our less valuable resources (like Wood or Sheep) for Wheat or other resources that are scarce for us.\"\n\n### Expert 3: The Risk Manager\n\"We need to be cautious about depleting our resources too much, especially Ore and Brick, which are valuable. Let's make sure we don't trade away too much of our Ore. We should consider trades that either increase our valuable resources or maintain a good balance.\"\n\nLet's synthesize their insights:\n1. We should aim to trade less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n2. We need to balance our resources to have more trading options.\n3. We should be cautious about depleting our valuable resources.\n\nConsidering these points, a potential trade could involve offering some Wood or Sheep for a resource that is either valuable or scarce for us, like Brick or Wheat.\n\nGiven the current resources and the insights, let's formulate a trade:\n- Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Sheep -> Requested: 1 Brick, 1 Wheat\n\nThis translates to: '[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat]'\n\nThe action for Turn 10 would be: '[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat]'.\n\nLet's execute this trade to see if it can improve our total value.\n\nAction: [Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat]",

However, we're out of Wheat.\n\nLet's synthesize this information:\n\n1. We need to make a trade that increases our total value.\n2. We should consider what Player 1 is likely to accept based on past behavior.\n\n### Potential Trade:\nConsidering our resources and the need to increase total value, let's examine possible trades.\n\nWe have:\n- Wheat: 1\n- Wood: 15\n- Sheep: 21\n- Brick: 16\n- Ore: 24\n\nLet's make an offer that could be attractive to Player 1 and beneficial to us.\n\n### Action:\nGiven that we are on the last turn and our current state, a potential trade could involve offering some of our resources for something of higher value. However, without knowing Player 1's current resources, we can only speculate.\n\nLet's propose a trade that could be reasonable based on our analysis:\n'[Offer: 4 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]' is not a good trade since we have more Ore and a decent amount of Brick. \n\nHowever, since we don't have a clear insight into what Player 1 has or wants, let's think about a more generic strategy.\n\n### Final Action:\nGiven that Player 1 accepted the last two trades, let's think about making a similar or slightly adjusted offer.\n\nOne potential offer could be: '[Offer: 3 Sheep, 4 Wood -> 1 Brick, 2 Wheat]'.\n\nHowever, this is speculative without knowing Player 1's needs or resources.\n\nSince we can't directly infer the best trade, let's directly analyze our last action and see the potential for a new offer.\n\nOur last offer was accepted, and it involved giving 5 Wood and 2 Sheep for 1 Brick and 1 Wheat.\n\n### Let's propose a similar trade:\n'[Offer: 4 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat]'.\n\nLet's use the format required for actions:\n`[Offer: 4 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat]`\n\nThe final answer is: `[Offer: 4 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat]`",

Port Engineer (focuses strictly on favorable value-ratios \u2013 \u201cturn 4-for-1 ports into 3-for-1 ports\u201d).\n2. End-Game Builder (looks at which resources are most limiting for the probable late-game objectives that will win).\n3. Liquidity Broker (is obsessed with the marginal utility of duplicating scarce resources and balancing portfolio liquidity).\n\nStep 1 \u2013 cold read of the ledger\n\nPort Engineer:\n\u201cPlayer 1 has 12 Ore-equivalent of value before any trade. My first check is the worst port ratios: I see 10 excess Brick and only 12 Ore at full value. A 3 Brick \u2192 1 Ore monopolistic trade would be +19 value instantly.\u201d\n\nEnd-Game Builder:\n\u201cThe trick is not pounds of bricks but whether we ever hit the late game. Scenario Alpha (winning score \u2265 23) needs ~15 Ore or equivalent. Player 1 will fall 3 Ore short. I therefore treat Ore as the constrained bottleneck. Every Ore gained has long-tailed pay-off; giving Brick away is paying 2.9 for 3.9 which is +1.0 per unit in my score-meter.\u201d\n\nLiquidity Broker:\n\u201cRelative quantities are garbage without relative liquidity. Brick\u2019s 3-for-1 port ratio is the worst in the game (7 other resources use 3-for-1). Ore and Sheep have 2-for-1 ports still audible downstream.

Net, swapping out Brick is almost always a pure gain.\u201d\n\nStep 2 \u2013 immediate framing of the only live offer on the table\n\nPort Engineer:\n\u201cThecounter-offer 4 Sheep,3 Wood \u2192 2 Ore,1 Brick from P0 would have us give away (4\u00d713 = 52) + (3\u00d711 = 33) = 85 value, and receive (2\u00d739 = 78) + (29) = 107, net +22. That is strictly above any port route margin; recommend Accept.\u201d\n\nEnd-Game Builder:\n\u201cDisagree on Sheep: Each Sheep has 13 nominal but only 8.5 when you adjust by being over-flow/inefficient for late cards. Recalculate: give 4\u00d78.5 = 34 and 3\u00d711 = 33 \u2192 total 67 out; receive 78+29=107 \u2192 +40 to late game objective pool. Accept this.\u201d\n\nLiquidity Broker:\n\u201cA safer path: chop the granularity differently. I\u2019d Accept the 4Sheep3Wood but pivot Brick out later through 3-for-1. Immediate deal is +20 liquidity; still leaves us only marginally short for Ore checkpoints.\u201d\n\nStep 3 \u2013 deciding vote\n\nPort Engineer, End-Game Builder, and Liquidity Broker all Accept.\n\n[Accept]",

      "response": "To tackle this task effectively, let's first identify the types of experts that would be most helpful for this trading decision. For a negotiation game focused on trading resources to increase the total value of one's resources, the following experts could be invaluable:\n\n1. **Valuation Expert**: Understands the value of each resource and can calculate the total value of resources before and after a trade.\n2. **Market Trend Analyst**: Can predict whether the value of resources is likely to change in the future based on past trends or game dynamics.\n3. **Game Theorist**: Analyzes the strategic aspects of the game, including how other players might react to different offers and how to maximize gains through optimal offer strategies.\n4. **Negotiation Strategist**: Focuses on the art of negotiation, providing insights into how to structure offers, when to be aggressive, and when to concede.\n\nLet's have these experts analyze the given situation step by step.\n\n**Turn 1 Analysis**\n\n1. **Valuation Expert**: \"Let's evaluate the initial resources: Wheat (6, valued at 6), Wood (20, valued at 11), Sheep (23, valued at 12), Brick (15, valued at 30), Ore (22, valued at 32). The total initial value is 6 + 11 + 12 + 30 + 32 = 91. We need to look for trades that increase this total value.\"\n   \n2. **Market Trend Analyst**: \"In this game, we don't have explicit market trends, but we can observe the trades. So far, we've made several offers to Player1, and the accepted trades have been beneficial. Let's analyze these trades for patterns or value increases.\"\n\n3. **Game Theorist**: \"Since Player1 has accepted some of our offers, it indicates they value the resources we're requesting. Let's structure our next offer to ensure we're gaining value. We should avoid offering too much of what's highly valued by us unless we get a significant return.\"\n\n4. **Negotiation Strategist**: \"We've made several offers, and some were accepted. This means we're on the right track. For the next offer, let's focus on what we can give up that isn't as valuable to us and what we can gain that is more valuable.\"\n\n**Evaluating Previous Trades**\n\n- The trade: '[Offer:6 Wheat ->2 Ore]' was accepted. Initially, 6 Wheat = 6, and 2 Ore = 2*32/22 = 2.91 (per unit value times quantity). We gave up 6 and got approximately 2.91*2 = 5.82, which seems like a loss. However, the total value calculation should consider the quantity and our initial surplus/deficit.\n- The trade: '[Offer:5 Wood,2 Sheep ->1 Brick,1 Wheat]' was accepted. Wood is valued at 11/20 per unit, and Sheep at 12/23 per unit. Brick is valued at 30/15 per unit, and Wheat at 6/6 per unit. Let's simplify this: We gave up (5*(11/20) + 2*(12/23)) and got (1*(30/15) + 1*(6/6)). This simplifies to (5.5 + 1.04) = 6.54 for 2 + 1 = 3. So, we got (2 + 1) = 3. The calculation shows a gain if the received value is higher than the given value.\n- The trade: '[Offer:4 Sheep,3 Wood ->2 Ore,1 Brick]' was accepted. Similar to the previous trade, let's evaluate the gain/loss.\n\nLet's directly calculate the impact of the trades:\n\n1. Before the first accepted trade: Total value = 91.\n- After '[Offer:6 Wheat ->2 Ore]': We had 0 Wheat and 24 Ore. Value change: Lost 6 (Wheat) + gained 2*32 - 22*32/22 = 64 - 32 = 32 (since we are calculating the value of 2 Ore). Net gain: 32 - 6 = 26. New total = 91 + 26 - 6 (for the wheat we didn't have anymore but is part of the initial 91) = 111 (since the wheat is gone, we adjust our count).\n- After '[Offer:5 Wood,2 Sheep ->1 Brick,1 Wheat]': Gave up 5 Wood and 2 Sheep. Received 1 Brick and 1 Wheat. Value change: Lost (5*(11/20) + 2*(12/23)) and gained (30/15 + 6/6). Let's directly check the quantity: We have 15 Wood, 21 Sheep, 16 Brick, and 7 Wheat. New total value = (7*1 + 15*(11/20) + 21*(12/23) + 16*(30/15) + 24*(32/22)).\n- After '[Offer:4 Sheep,3 Wood ->2 Ore,1 Brick]': We have 12 Wood, 17 Sheep, 17 Brick, and 7 Wheat, 26 Ore. Let's directly check the value.\n\nLet's simplify and directly assess the best next step.\n\n**Current State After Last Trade**:\n- Wheat: 7\n- Wood: 12\n- Sheep: 17\n- Brick: 17\n- Ore: 26\n\n**Valuation Expert**: \"Let's calculate the current total value: (7*1 + 12*(11/20) + 17*(12/23) + 17*(30/15) + 26*(32/22)) = 7 + 6.6 + 8.87 + 34 + 37.82 = 94.29 (approximately, using the initial valuation method for simplicity). We actually directly know the values: Wheat (7, 7), Wood (12, 6.6), Sheep (17, 8.87), Brick (17, 34), Ore (26, 37.82), totaling around 94.\"\n\n**Game Theorist**: \"Since we've had successful trades, let's continue the strategy but be cautious not to overcommit to a single type of resource. We should propose a trade that increases our total value.\"\n\n**Negotiation Strategist**: \"For the next turn, let's think about a reasonable trade that could be proposed. We need to identify what we can offer and what we want in return. Considering our current resources, we could think about giving up some of the less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\"\n\nLet's propose a trade based on our analysis. \n\nSince it's the 10th turn, we need to be decisive.\n\n**Turn 10 Action**\n\nConsidering our resources and the need to increase our total value, let's directly make a strategic offer.\n\nGiven our current resources, a potential trade could involve offering some of our abundant resources for something more valuable. \n\nOne potential action is: '[Offer:5 Sheep,2 Wood ->3 Brick,1 Ore]'.\n\nThis is just a hypothetical example; the actual decision should be based on detailed value calculations and strategic considerations.\n\nLet's directly evaluate and decide.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer:5 Sheep,2 Wood ->3 Brick,1 Ore]}$",
