Let's explore how each expert approaches the situation based on our current resources and their values.\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Maximizer\n**Step 1:** After analyzing the current resources, I focus on high-value materials. The Ore we possess has the highest value per unit (37). I suggest trading some Ore for a lower-value but more versatile resource that we can use in future trades. \n\n**Proposed Offer:** \n'[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]'\n\n---\n\n### Expert 2: The Strategic Trader\n**Step 1:** My approach is to leverage the demand for building materials.

I notice that I can easily part with some of my lowest-value items (Wheat or Wood) in exchange for higher-value items like Ore or Brick, which will help increase my overall flexibility in future trades.\n\n**Proposed Offer:** \n'[Offer: 2 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]'\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Offers:\n1. **Expert 1:** 3 Sheep, 2 Ore for 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\n2. **Expert 2:** 4 Wheat, 5 Wood for 6 Brick\n3. **Expert 3:** 2 Wheat, 3 Sheep for 2 Ore, 1 Brick\n\nNow we'll review the responses to these offers in the next turns based on the game's trades.

They might have resources I don\u2019t know the value of or aim to get a better deal. \n- The offer from Player 1 (10 Sheep for 7 Wood) is unfavorable based on my resource evaluation. However, I could counter-offer to make it more attractive.\n  \n### Expert 3: Risk Manager\nThis expert focuses on the risks associated with trading and potential resource imbalance.\n\n- Rejecting Player 1's offer is wise as it entails a significant loss. \n- I need to be cautious about overcommitting my resources. Trading too many Sheep, which carry significant value, could leave me vulnerable.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Deny Player 1's current offer** as it results in a negative net gain.\n2. Consider a counter-offer that involves my resources that won\u2019t significantly impact my value while exploring other trades.\n3. If there's no good opportunity with Player 1, I may also reconsider Player 1\u2019s initial rejection once more favorable trading options are available or they show interest in a more balanced trade.\n\nSince Player 1\u2019s offer is not in my interest, I will respond:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]  \n[Deny]",

      "response": "Let's analyze the situation with three different trading experts: a Resource Analyst, a Market Strategist, and a Risk Assessor. Each expert will take turns outlining their strategy for maximizing the total value of Player 0's resources through negotiation.\n\n### Expert 1: Resource Analyst\n**Step 1:**  \nThe Resource Analyst will evaluate the current resources and their values. Player 0 has:  \n- Wheat: 20 (5 each, Total Value = 100)\n- Wood: 22 (12 each, Total Value = 264)\n- Sheep: 10 (15 each, Total Value = 150)\n- Brick: 7 (22 each, Total Value = 154)\n- Ore: 18 (37 each, Total Value = 666)\n\n**Total Value:** 1334\n\nI see that the highest value per quantity is Ore (value = 37). I should aim to maximize trades involving lower-value resources for higher-value resources. It looks like Brick is valuable but is not abundant. Hence, trading away some Ore for Brick might be beneficial.\n\n**Step 2:**  \nConsidering previous offers rejected, I notice that Player 1 may not be interested in Sheep or Ore based on their offers. Thus, I should explore trading Wheat or Wood since they are also valuable but less strategically targeted. A potential offer could be:\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 5 Brick]`\n\n### Expert 2: Market Strategist\n**Step 1:**  \nThe Market Strategist identifies the current market dynamics. Player 1 has shown disinterest in both Sheep and Ore offers, indicating they might not value those resources highly. Given the nature of oscillating offers, it may be wise to explore what Player 1 values more.\n\n**Step 2:**  \nSince Player 1 proposed Wood in exchange for Sheep, I recommend offering Wood, combined with a resource player 1 values more. We know Player 0 has plenty of Wood available. Therefore, an offer I would propose is:\n\n`[Offer: 10 Wood -> 10 Sheep]`\n\nThis offer may entice Player 1 as it favors their proposed trading tactics.\n\n### Expert 3: Risk Assessor\n**Step 1:**  \nThe Risk Assessor will consider uncertainties in trades and the possible outcomes. Player 0 has made several rejected offers, indicating that their trading strategy needs reevaluation to prevent losses.\n\n**Step 2:**  \nTo minimize risk while maximizing potential value increase, I suggest switching focus to a less volatile trade commodity. Since most of Player 1's current interests have focused on Wood and Sheep, I recommend offering a mixed trade to leverage the best possible outcome.\n\nI propose the following offer considering amounts and past interactions:\n\n`[Offer: 4 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 7 Wood, 3 Brick]`\n\nThis offer seeks to gain concrete resources while relying on weighted value tradebacks.\n\n---\n\nIn the next turns, Player 0 will proceed based on each of these expert recommendations. As a team, we will weigh which offers are made to achieve better outcomes for enhanced resource values. The combined strategy should allow for adaptive trading based on Player 1's responses to enhance the overall resources effectively. \n\nLet's proceed with the most favorable offers based on these expert strategies.

They haven\u2019t engaged with Wood in any prior offer, but our calculations show Wood has high per-unit value (1.428).  \n   - Counter with a Brick-centric offer that includes Sheep (which we have in abundance) to incentivize Wood trade.  \n\n### Decision:  \nReject the current offer (**[Deny]**). Instead, propose a counteroffer that maximizes our value and targets Wood:  \n- **Give: 4 Brick + 1 Sheep** (total loss: \\(4 \\times 1.125 + 1 \\times 0.72 = 4.5 + 0.72 = 5.22\\))  \n- **Request: 4 Wood** (total gain: \\(4 \\times 1.428 \u2248 5.71\\))  \n- **Net value increase: +0.49**  \n\nThis offer strategically offloads low-value Sheep, leverages Player 0\u2019s Brick demand, and secures Wood at a favorable rate.  \n\n**[Deny]**  \n**[Offer: 4 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 4 Wood]**",

Here are the three expert perspectives:\n\n### Expert 1: Resource Value Analyst\nThis expert focuses on the value of resources in your inventory compared to potential trades.\n\n1. **Current Resource Analysis**:\n   - Wheat: 20 (5 each) = 100\n   - Wood: 22 (12 each) = 264\n   - Sheep: 10 (15 each) = 150\n   - Brick: 7 (22 each) = 154\n   - Ore: 18 (37 each) = 666\n   - **Total Value**: 1334\n\n2. **Player 1's Offer Evaluation**:\n   - Player 1 previously offered: 4 Brick, 1 Sheep for 4 Wood.\n   - **Value Comparison**:\n     - Your trade: 4 Brick (88) + 1 Sheep (15) = 103\n     - Their trade: 4 Wood (48) = 48\n   - **Conclusion**: Accept if needs align, but overall value decline.\n\n### Expert 2: Strategic Negotiator\nThis expert evaluates the trading strategy and the negotiation dynamics.\n\n1. **Previous Offers**:\n   - Player 1 seems resistant in past offers, which may indicate their resources' value perception.\n   - Offers have generally not favored you based on your resource wealth.\n\n2. **Next Step**:\n   - Proposal: Counter-offer 4 Wood for 4 Brick, as the direct resource exchange appeals to synergy and matches both interests.\n   - Possible Counter-Offer: [Offer: 4 Wood -> 4 Brick]\n\n### Expert 3: Risk Management Consultant\nThis expert focuses on assessing the risk of trading versus keeping your resources.\n\n1. **Risk Evaluation**:\n   - Retaining diverse resources is viable; however, trading excessively may deplete core resources without increasing overall value.\n   - Since current offers seem to undervalue your high-value resources (Ore), keeping Ore while trading less valuable items (like Wheat or Sheep) could maintain advantage.\n\n2. **Plan Moving Forward**:\n   - Suggest to offer lesser-used resources for a fair trade.\n   - Counter-offer: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Sheep -> Requested items: 6 Wood, 3 Brick] with modifications if future offer from Player 1 allows evaluation based on proportional value conversion.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the insights from the experts, as Player 0, I will formulate the next action by preparing a trade offer that emphasizes resource balance and values favorably according to the previous evaluations.\n\n**Action**: \nI'm going to make the following counter-offer: \n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 4 Brick] \n\nIt's directly a 2-for-2 exchange that leverages the current dynamics while considering all expert insights.",

      "response": "After careful analysis by three expert advisors, the consensus is to accept Player 0's offer of **4 Wood** in exchange for **4 Brick**. Here is the reasoning from each expert:\n\n**Expert 1: Resource Value Analyst**  \n- Per-unit values: Wood = 1.429 (10/7), Brick = 1.125 (27/24).  \n- Giving 4 Brick (total value: 4.5) for 4 Wood (total value: 5.716) yields a **net gain of +1.216 value**.  \n- Verdict: Strongly recommend accepting to maximize value.  \n\n**Expert 2: Resource Volume Strategist**  \n- Current Brick (24) is abundant (27 total value), while Wood (7) is moderate and high-value.  \n- Post-trade: Brick reduces to 20 (still ample), Wood increases to 11.  \n- Improves versatility for future trades, especially given Player 1's repeated efforts to acquire Wood earlier.  \n- Verdict: Trade optimizes resource balance\u2014accept.  \n\n**Expert 3: Behavioral Economist**  \n- Player 0 previously rejected Player 1's counter of \"4 Brick + 1 Sheep for 4 Wood\" but now offers \"4 Wood for 4 Brick,\" effectively removing the Sheep cost.  \n- This signals concession\u2014likely due to high Brick demand or eagerness to close\u2014so accepting capitalizes on favorable momentum.  \n- Risk of rejection or deal withdrawal if countering again.  \n- Verdict: Accept; better than prior proposals and minimizes renegotiation risk.  \n\n### Final Decision: [Accept]  \nThis trade increases Player 1\u2019s total value while preserving strategic flexibility.

      "response": "Let's analyze the trading situation with three different expert perspectives to determine the best course of action moving forward after the last successful trade. \n\n**Expert 1: The Resource Value Maximizer**\n- This expert focuses on maximizing the total resource value in each trade. After the trade with Player 1, Player 0 now has:\n    - Wheat: 20 (Value: 5)\n    - Wood: 26 (Value: 12)  (after receiving 4 Wood)\n    - Sheep: 7 (Value: 15)  (after giving away 4 Sheep)\n    - Brick: 4 (Value: 22)\n    - Ore: 18 (Value: 37)\n\n  Total value before trade: \n  - Wheat: 20 * 5 = 100\n  - Wood: 26 * 12 = 312\n  - Sheep: 7 * 15 = 105\n  - Brick: 4 * 22 = 88\n  - Ore: 18 * 37 = 666\n  - Total Value = 100 + 312 + 105 + 88 + 666 = 1271\n\n  **Next Step (Expert 1):** Look for offers that can increase the total resource value. Since Brick has a high value but is limited in quantity, I might trade some lower-value resources.\n\n**Expert 2: The Demand-Oriented Trader**\n- This expert analyzes the resources which are in demand and what other players might want. After trading with Player 1, I understand that players are interested in Wood and Brick. Since Player 1 is less interested in my Sheep and Ore, I should focus on trading them for resources that will help increase my interaction with Player 1.\n\n  **Next Step (Expert 2):** Propose an offer that includes valuable items that Player 1 may need. Since I still have 18 Ore, I could offer 2 Ore for 1 Sheep, considering the value and trade dynamics.\n\n**Expert 3: The Risk-Averse Trader**\n- This expert prefers stability over taking risks with trades that could potentially diminish resources. Given that my recent trades have not yielded desirable returns, it\u2019s crucial I don\u2019t jeopardize my position by offering too many resources.\n\n  **Next Step (Expert 3):** Keep trades minimal. I recommend focusing on one or two key resources and avoiding giving away valuable quantities like Ore or large amounts of Sheep. I could offer 2 Wheat for 2 Wood since that minimizes loss and allows maintaining a good quantity for future trades.\n\n### Next action from Player 0:\nGiven the inputs from all experts, I will propose an offer that maintains stability while aiming to increase total values. \n\n**Selected Offer: [Offer: 2 Ore -> 1 Sheep]** \n\nThis approach is balanced and keeps valuable resources while attempting to obtain Sheep, which could be more favorable for future trades.",
