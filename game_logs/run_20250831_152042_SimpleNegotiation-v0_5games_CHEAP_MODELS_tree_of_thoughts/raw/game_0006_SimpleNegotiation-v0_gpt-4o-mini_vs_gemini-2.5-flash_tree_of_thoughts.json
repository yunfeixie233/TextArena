      "response": "Here are my three experts:\n\n1.  **The Value Maximizer:** This expert focuses purely on the numerical value of resources and aims to make trades that result in the highest possible total value increase.\n2.  **The Strategic Thinker:** This expert considers not just immediate value, but also the potential future utility of resources, how common or rare they might be, and what they could be used for later (e.g., building, more valuable trades).\n3.  **The Risk Averter:** This expert prioritizes maintaining a diverse set of resources and avoids trades that would leave me too specialized or vulnerable to shortages of critical materials.\n\n---\n\n**Player 1 (You):**\nResources:\n*   Wheat: 8 (Value: 6)\n*   Wood: 10 (Value: 9)\n*   Sheep: 17 (Value: 16)\n*   Brick: 6 (Value: 26)\n*   Ore: 9 (Value: 38)\n\nIncoming Offer from Player 0: Offered: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> Requested: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1 (The Value Maximizer):**\nMy first step is to calculate the current total value of your resources and the value change of the proposed trade.\n\nCurrent Total Value: (8 * 6) + (10 * 9) + (17 * 16) + (6 * 26) + (9 * 38) = 48 + 90 + 272 + 156 + 342 = 908\n\nValue of what Player 0 Offers (to you):\n*   3 Sheep: 3 * 16 = 48\n*   2 Ore: 2 * 38 = 76\n*   Total Offered Value: 48 + 76 = 124\n\nValue of what Player 0 Requests (from you):\n*   5 Brick: 5 * 26 = 130\n*   2 Sheep: 2 * 16 = 32\n*   Total Requested Value: 130 + 32 = 162\n\nNet Value Change for You: Value Offered - Value Requested = 124 - 162 = -38.\nThis trade would decrease your total value by 38.\n\n**Expert 2 (The Strategic Thinker):**\nMy initial assessment focuses on the types of resources involved and their relative scarcity/demand. Player 0 is offering Sheep and Ore, and asking for Brick and Sheep. You currently have a very high quantity of Sheep (17), making them potentially expendable. Ore (value 38) is your most valuable single resource, and Player 0 is *offering* two of them, which is interesting. Brick (value 26) is also high value.\n\nMy first thought is that you are giving away a lot of high-value resources (Brick) and some of an abundant, lower-value resource (Sheep) for a mix of high-value (Ore) and abundant, lower-value (Sheep). I need to consider if holding onto high-value Brick is better than gaining more of your most valuable Ore, especially if Brick is a key building material.\n\n**Expert 3 (The Risk Averter):**\nMy first step is to look at your current resource distribution and how the trade would impact your quantities.\n\nCurrent Quantities:\n*   Wheat: 8\n*   Wood: 10\n*   Sheep: 17\n*   Brick: 6\n*   Ore: 9\n\nIf you accept the trade:\n*   Sheep: 17 (current) + 3 (offered) - 2 (requested) = 18\n*   Ore: 9 (current) + 2 (offered) = 11\n*   Brick: 6 (current) - 5 (requested) = 1\n\nThis trade would drastically reduce your Brick count from 6 to 1. While it increases your Sheep and Ore, losing 5/6ths of your Brick is a significant concentration risk, making you very dependent on acquiring more Brick if it's needed for future plays.",

      "response": "### Expert Analysis\n\n**Expert 1: The Resource Valuator**\n- **Step 1**: Analyzing the values of current resources, it\u2019s clear that Brick (Value: 30) and Ore (Value: 33) hold the highest values compared to the other resources. However, Wheat (Value: 5) and Wood (Value: 8) are less valuable but in larger quantities, which could provide more flexibility in trades. \n- **Recommendation**: Aim to trade less valuable resources (Wheat, Wood) for more valuable resources (Brick, Ore) or seek trades that increase overall valuations.\n\n**Expert 2: The Strategic Negotiator**\n- **Step 1**: Considering Player 1's rejection of my initial trade offer, it is prudent to reassess the value of resources for potential future trades. Since they did not propose a counteroffer, perhaps they are not interested in the resources I offered.\n- **Recommendation**: I should focus on identifying what resources Player 1 might want. It may be better to initiate trades with a different player now that I understand Player 1's lack of interest.\n\n**Expert 3: The Risk Assessor**\n- **Step 1**: I evaluate the risk of holding onto lower-valued resources while also considering the market dynamics. Given that Brick is the most valuable resource and I currently possess it, it could be wise to explore offers involving Ore to ensure I maximize returns.\n- **Recommendation**: Stay cautious about trading high-value resources like Brick and monitor the exchange value with other players. \n\n---\n\n### Next Step\nGiven the analysis of the experts, I will adjust my strategy. Since Player 1 rejected the last offer, it is time to either propose a new offer or explore trading with a different player.\n\n**Action Proposal**: \nI will assess what resources I can afford to trade (primarily focusing on Wheat or Wood for lower-value trades) for high-value resources, primarily Brick or Ore.\n\n**New Trade Offer to Player 2** (hypothetical assuming they exist):\n- **Offer**: \n- '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]'\n\nThis shift focuses on using a bulk of the low-value Wheat to gain high-value resources that boost my total valuation. \n\n**Next Action**: I will proceed with this offer. \n- **Action**: '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]'",

I'll assess how this trade impacts your overall resource distribution.\n\n**Expert 3 (The Opportunity Cost Analyst):** I consider not just the immediate trade, but what other trades or actions this might prevent or enable. I'll evaluate the opportunity cost of accepting or denying this specific offer.\n\n---\n**Expert 1 (The Resource Value Maximizer):**\nCurrent total value: (8 * 6) + (10 * 9) + (17 * 16) + (6 * 26) + (9 * 38) = 48 + 90 + 272 + 156 + 342 = 908.\nValue of resources offered by Player 0 (Wheat): 4 * 6 = 24.\nValue of resources requested by Player 0 (Ore, Brick): (2 * 38) + (1 * 26) = 76 + 26 = 102.\nThis trade asks me to give up 102 value to gain 24 value. This is a net loss of 78 value. From a pure value perspective, this trade is terrible.\n\n**Expert 2 (The Strategic Balancer):**\nCurrently you have an abundance of Sheep and Wood, decent amounts of Wheat and Ore, and relatively few Brick. This trade would give you Wheat and you would give up Ore and Brick. Giving up Brick, which you already have few of, for Wheat, which you have a moderate amount of and is of lower individual value, further imbalances your resource distribution. You would deplete valuable Ore and scarce Brick, while accumulating more of a less valuable resource.\n\n**Expert 3 (The Opportunity Cost Analyst):**\nAccepting this trade for 4 Wheat in exchange for 2 Ore and 1 Brick would be a significant loss in value. Ore is your most valuable resource, and Brick is also quite valuable. Giving these up for a comparatively less valuable resource like Wheat (even if you have a decent quantity) means you might miss out on better trades later where Ore or Brick are highly sought after by other players or for your own potential development. This offer seems to be a predatory attempt to acquire your high-value resources cheaply.\n\n---\n**Expert 1 (The Resource Value Maximizer):**\nMy initial assessment holds: this trade results in a significant net loss of 78 in total resource value. Accepting this would be detrimental to your primary goal of increasing your total value.\n\n**Expert 2 (The Strategic Balancer):**\nThis trade worsens your resource balance by diminishing your high-value, scarcer resources (Ore, Brick) and increasing your lower-value, more common resource (Wheat). Maintaining a healthier spread of essential resources, especially those of high individual value, is preferable.\n\n**Expert 3 (The Opportunity Cost Analyst):**\nGiven the unfavorable value exchange and resource imbalance, the opportunity cost of accepting this trade is very high. You would be giving up highly liquid and valuable resources that could be used for much better trades or for potential high-value development in your own hands. Denying this allows you to hold your valuable Ore and Brick for better future offers.\n\n---\n**Expert 1 (The Resource Value Maximizer):**\nBased on the clear negative value proposition, my recommendation is to deny this offer. An alternative would be to counter with an offer that ensures a net positive value gain for you, or at least a neutral exchange if strategic balancing is prioritized.\n\n**Expert 2 (The Strategic Balancer):**\nI recommend denying this offer. Instead, you should aim to acquire more high-value resources that you are lacking (like Brick, or more Ore) while trying to offload some of your abundant lower-value resources (like Sheep or Wood, if necessary) in exchange for higher-value ones.\n\n**Expert 3 (The Opportunity Cost Analyst):**\nI agree with the others. Deny this offer. Player 0 is trying to leverage your potentially perceived need for something into a very unfavorable trade for you. Protect your valuable resources and wait for better opportunities, or propose a counter offer that seeks to increase your total value using your excess resources.\n\n---\n[Deny]",

The total value is 1190.\n2. **Trading Strategy**: Since Brick has the highest value per unit (30), trading for more Brick or high-value items, such as Ore, is preferable. I would suggest offering a combination of lower-value resources to fetch high-value resources while preserving the higher value of my Bricks.\n3. **Next Steps**: I recommend considering trades that leverage the high value of Ore or Brick. My goal will be to either obtain more Ore or high-value items that can increase overall value. \n\n### Expert 2: The Resource Quantity Advocate\nThis expert emphasizes maintaining a good quantity of various resources.\n\n1. **Assessment of Current Resources**: Player 0 has a relatively balanced mix of resources with good quantities, especially in Brick and Ore.\n2. **Trading Strategy**: Rather than strictly focusing on higher-valued trades, maintaining a healthy spread of resources is important. Having a solid variety can aid in future trades and crafting.\n3. **Next Steps**: I advise exploring smaller trades that help diversify the resource pool while still increasing the value. For example, offering some Wheat to acquire different resources without depleting high-value items might work.\n\n### Expert 3: The Market Trend Analyst\nThis expert keeps an eye on trade trends and player behaviors.\n\n1. **Assessment of Player Behavior**: Player 1 has been rejecting trades that seem less beneficial to them. Monitoring their preferences is crucial for successful negotiations.\n2. **Trading Strategy**: I'll analyze what resources are likely in demand for Player 1; perhaps they\u2019re low on Brick or Ore themselves. Offering them resources that they likely desire may enhance the chances of an accepted trade.\n3. **Next Steps**: My suggestion is to offer 3 Sheep and request resources that are currently scarce or in demand by Player 1. Preparing a follow-up proposal will leverage the earlier rejected trades efficiently.\n\n### Overall Consensus\nAll three experts recognize the importance of trading effectively to increase total resource value. The immediate goal should be to analyze what Player 1 could be lacking and adjust the offers accordingly. \n\nNow, we need to formulate the next offer. Based on the collective input, Player 0 could make an offer that appeals to the observed needs of Player 1.\n\n### Proposed Trade Action\n**Offer**: [Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Ore, 3 Brick] \n\nThis offer keeps a strong balance while also targeting high-value resources that could be useful for Player 0 to enhance the total value of their asset in the negotiation game.",

Their offers involve giving away Sheep and Wheat. This confirms they highly value Ore and Brick, consistent with my own high valuation of them. This offer is worse than the previous \"4 Wheat for 2 Ore, 1 Brick\" because it asks for more Brick (3 instead of 1) and gives me 3 Sheep and 2 Wheat (total value 60) for 2 Ore and 3 Brick (total value 154), leading to a significant loss. I can likely leverage their need for Ore and Brick in a future counter-offer.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\nBased on my analysis, accepting this offer would decrease your total resource value by 94. This is clearly detrimental. Therefore, I advise you to reject this offer.\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Strategist**\nGiving up 2 Ore and 3 Brick, which are critical high-value resources, for 3 Sheep and 2 Wheat, which are lower-value and I have in abundance, is a poor strategic move. It weakens your high-value resource base significantly. I recommend rejecting this offer to preserve your high-value resources.\n\n**Expert 3: The Negotiation Analyst**\nPlayer 0's consistent attempts to acquire Ore and Brick indicate a strong need from their side. This offer, like the previous ones, is highly disadvantageous to you. Rejecting this offer further signals that you are not desperate and will not accept low-value exchanges for your prized resources. This strengthens your position for future negotiations where you can demand more for your Ore and Brick.\n\n---\n\nI have considered the advice from all three experts. All experts agree that this offer is unfavorable. The Value Maximizer shows a substantial loss in value. The Resource Strategist highlights the loss of critical high-value resources. The Negotiation Analyst points out Player 0's apparent desperation for Ore and Brick, suggesting better deals are possible.\n\nGiven this unanimous advice, I will reject the offer.\n\n[Deny]",

If I could tolerate some trades for minimal loss that has potential for better gains, it would benefit me.\n\n### Expert 3: Strategic Negotiation Expert\n**Analysis:**\n- Since Player 1 is repeatedly rejecting my offers, it\u2019s important to reassess my approach. \n- I should modify my offers to make them more appealing to Player 1 while keeping in mind my goal of enhancing my resource value.\n- Offering combinations that might involve multiple resources or reduced quantities for higher-valued trades may avoid further rejections.\n\n**Next Step:**\nI could slightly alter my previous offers to include more of what Player 1 might need or to adjust my requests to be less demanding while still aiming for higher-value resources.\n\n### Combined Strategy\nBased on the advice from the three experts, for my next offer, I will propose an exchange that utilizes my higher quantity resources (like Wheat and Sheep) in a way that is enticing for Player 1 while strategically aligning with their needs. \n\nI'll offer:\n- **[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]**\n\nThis offer might entice Player 1 to accept, and by gaining Ore and Brick, I increase the total value of my resources effectively. \n\n### Executing Next Offer\n**Action:**\n- **[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]**\n\nNow, I'll await Player 1's response to this offer.",

The requested items have a combined value of 102. This is a net loss of 72 value for me.

This tells me they value these resources highly, or perhaps need them for a key building/upgrade. My Ore and Brick are my most valuable individual resources. I should be very careful about parting with them unless the return is overwhelmingly in my favor, especially since I have relatively few Brick.\n\n**Expert 3: The Market Analyst**\n\n*   **Thinking Step 1:** We've had several offers from Player 0, and they've all followed a similar pattern: they offer low-value resources (Wheat, Sheep) for my high-value resources (Ore, Brick). This implies they are either desperate for Ore/Brick, or they perceive me as naive. Their offers consistently demand a significant net value transfer from me to them.\n\n---\n\n**Expert 1: The Value Maximizer**\n\n*   **Thinking Step 2:** Based on the large negative value proposition, I should absolutely reject this offer. There's no scenario where I accept such a lopsided trade.\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Strategist**\n\n*   **Thinking Step 2:** Since Player 0 is persistent in offering low-value resources for my high-value ones, I need to either counter-offer something that's advantageous to me, or try to get rid of my excess low-value resources for something I need without giving up my core high-value assets. My Sheep is abundant, and its value isn't as high as Ore/Brick. Wheat is also in decent quantity.\n\n**Expert 3: The Market Analyst**\n\n*   **Thinking Step 2:** Given their repeated attempts to acquire my high-value resources at a significant discount, Player 0's willingness to trade is high, but their offers are exploitative. I should not accept any offer that results in a net value loss for me. Furthermore, I should consider if there's a way to leverage their apparent need for Ore/Brick without giving it away cheaply.\n\n---\n\n**Player 1's Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is a clear value loss. My experts confirm this isn't a good deal and that Player 0 is consistently trying to extract high-value resources from me cheaply. Given my large quantity of Sheep and decent quantity of Wood, and Player 0's apparent need for Ore and Brick, I could try to offload some Sheep or Wood for something that benefits me. However, I need to ensure any counter-offer is still advantageous.\n\nI will reject Player 0's current offer. I want to make an offer that significantly increases my overall value, ideally by leveraging my plentiful Sheep or Wood to acquire more valuable resources like Ore or Brick, but on terms favorable to me.

Player 0 accepted this.\n\nHere\u2019s an analysis from three different experts:\n\n### Expert 1: The Value Maximizer\n\nMy goal is to increase my total resource value. I need to identify resources I have a lot of that are relatively low value, and what resources I need more of that are high value. After the last trade, I still have a good amount of Sheep and Wood. Ore and Brick are very valuable. The previous trade was successful because I gave up 8 Sheep and 2 Wood (total value: 8*16 + 2*9 = 128 + 18 = 146) for 2 Ore and 1 Brick (total value: 2*38 + 1*26 = 76 + 26 = 102). Hmm, I just realized I miscalculated in the previous turn if my goal was to maximize value. I actually *lost* value in that trade (146 out for 102 in). I need to be more careful. The goal is to INCREASE total value. I will leave the discussion now.\n\n### Expert 2: The Resource Manager\n\nMy primary objective is to acquire more high-value resources like Ore and Brick, even if it means parting with a decent quantity of lower-value resources. I also want to maintain a diversified portfolio of resources. Looking at the current inventory, 17 Sheep is quite a lot, and its individual value is relatively low compared to Ore and Brick. I also have 8 Wheat, which is also low value. My last trade was accepted by Player 0, which suggests they might be interested in Sheep and Wood. I need to find a way to get more Ore and Brick without overpaying.\n\n### Expert 3: The Opportunist\n\nI'm looking for opportunities to make profitable trades. Player 0 has repeatedly tried to get Ore and Brick, as seen in their offers. This tells me they value these resources. My previous offer of 8 Sheep and 2 Wood for 2 Ore and 1 Brick *was accepted*, which means Player 0 found value in that exchange from their side. While Expert 1 pointed out that I lost value in that specific trade, Player 0's consistent attempts to get Ore/Brick means they likely *still* need them. I can leverage this. I need to make an offer that feels beneficial to Player 0 while actually benefiting me. I should be wary of offering *too much* of my valuable resources.\n\n**Player 1's Turn (after experts' thoughts)**\n\nYou currently have:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 8    Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 10   Value: 9\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 9    Value: 16 (17 - 8 = 9 after accepting the trade)\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 7    Value: 26 (6 + 1 = 7 after accepting the trade)\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 11   Value: 38 (9 + 2 = 11 after accepting the trade)\n\n**Expert 2: The Resource Manager (thinking step 2)**\n\nMy inventory adjusted after the last trade. I now have 9 Sheep, 7 Brick, and 11 Ore. My Ore and Brick count has increased, which is good. I still have a surplus of Sheep and Wheat which have lower individual values. I should consider offering a combination of these or possibly some Wood, but not too much since Wood isn't as high in quantity as Sheep/Wheat. I will aim to get more Brick, as it is slightly less valuable than Ore but still very high.\n\n**Expert 3: The Opportunist (thinking step 2)**\n\nPlayer 0 accepted my last offer, even if it was a negative value trade for me. This means they are still looking for resources, and they might be willing to pay a premium for Ore/Brick. I should try to get more Ore/Brick, but this time, I need to ensure a positive value trade for myself. I still have abundant Sheep and Wheat. I should also remember that Player 0 previously offered 4-5 Wheat for Ore/Brick, so they value Wheat too. I need to assess how much more I am willing to give up relative to what I gain.\n\n**Player 1's action:**\n\n[Offer: 6 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]",

If Player 1 continues to reject valuable trades, proposing varied combinations may find a sweet spot.\n\n---\n\n### Next Step (Based on Expert Advice)\nConsidering all perspectives, it may be prudent to **reject** Player 1's current offer since it doesn't significantly improve the total resource value. Instead, proceed with my own offer to keep the bargaining alive and target the high-value resources that I want.\n\n**Action:** I will make an offer to Player 1: \n\n**Offer: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]**",
