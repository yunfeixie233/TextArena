This creates a potential win threat in column 0 (if I can claim cell 3 later) and aligns with common Tic Tac Toe strategy to control corners after an opponent occupies the center. The updated board will be:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nNow, Player 0 (O) is forced to respond, and the immediate threats can be managed accordingly. My next moves will aim to create a fork or block potential O wins. \n\n**Current Board Preview (after my move):**  \nX |   |    \n---+---+---  \n  | O |    \n---+---+---  \nX |   | O\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  Player 1 is analyzing the board...  \n**Threat Assessment**: Player 0 (O) has a winning threat in the middle row (cells 3 and 4).

The board becomes:  \n    ```\n    X | O |   \n    O | O | X  \n    X | X | O  \n    ```  \n    Only cell 2 remains.
