The final state of the board is indeed:\n\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | X \n\nSince you have three 'O's in a row (positions [1], [2], and none other in a row; however, you have 'O's in positions [3], [4], and not in a row either), let's examine the board more closely. You actually have achieved a significant presence on the board but not a straightforward win.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it's clear that while you haven't won with three 'O's in a row, the game has reached a state where all possible moves have been made or considered, and there's no straightforward winning line for 'O'. The game has effectively ended in a draw due to the lack of available moves and no clear winning condition being met for either 'X' or 'O'.\n\nThe final outcome is a draw. Well played!",
