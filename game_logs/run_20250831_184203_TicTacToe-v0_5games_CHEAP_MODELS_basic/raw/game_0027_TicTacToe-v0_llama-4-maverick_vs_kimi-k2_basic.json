'X' has taken position 0, likely aiming to control the diagonal or the top row.\n\nTo counter this, I need to ensure that 'X' doesn't get to control the diagonal or the top row easily. Since I've already occupied the center (position 4), my next move should be strategic.\n\nThe available moves are: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n\nPlacing 'O' in position 2 could be a good move as it:\n1. Prepares to potentially control the top row if 'X' continues on the top row.\n2. Keeps the diagonal (0-4-8) in check, as 'X' would need to place its next 'X' in position 8 to continue the diagonal threat.\n\nHowever, a more immediate consideration is to directly counter 'X's current position and prepare for the next 'X' move. \n\nLet's analyze further:\n- If I play '[2]', the board becomes:\n```\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n```\nThis doesn't immediately counter 'X's diagonal threat but does prepare to potentially control the top row.\n\n- Another strategic move is to play '[8]', which directly counters the diagonal threat by 'X' and keeps the option open for other moves.\n\nLet's go with `[8]` to directly counter the diagonal threat by 'X'.
