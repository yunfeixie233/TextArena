Diagonal (4 \u2192 8 \u2192 corner 0 is taken by X, but also doesn't work as 0 is taken).  \n  2. **Row 2 (6,7,8)** \u2192 putting O in [8] forces [7] to block; opponent must go there or lose.  \n\nLet\u2019s confirm the double-threat:\n- After [8], next turn [7] is needed by opponent to block both diagonal (doesn't apply here) and bottom row (new O-O-_ in 6-8 needs 8-8-).\nWait more accurately: **after [8]** the bottom row is `X _ O` with only 7 open. The middle row is `_ O _`, which doesn\u2019t win, and column 2 is `O _ O` needing 5 to win.\n\nThis forces my opponent to block [5], keeping the game going favorably.\n\nBut actually, there\u2019s a **direct winning spot** I missed: if I take [5], then row 1 becomes `3-O-5` as `_ O O`, which is not a win. Columns: the center column `1-4-7` has _ O _, not a win; right column `2-5-8` is O-O-_ \u2014 yes! [5] completes two O's and only needs 8 to win. So it's not an immediate win. My bad.\n\n**Instead** the key **immediate win** is the right column: cells 2, 5, and 8. I have 2 and 8 is open, making [8] the **winning move** for the vertical line 2-5-8 once I play [8].\n\nTherefore, optimal move is [8].\n\n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  [7]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]'\n[Player 0] [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[5]'\n[Player 1]  [1]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]'",
