A good strategy is to challenge 'X' by placing 'O' in a position that could potentially create a fork or block 'X' from winning.\n\nOne of the possible moves is to place 'O' at '[2]' or '[3]' to start building a potential row or to put pressure on 'X'.\n\nLet's place 'O' at '[2]'.\n\nMy move is: [2]\n\nSo, the board will be:\n\n O |1 | O \n---+---+---\n3 | X |5 \n---+---+---\n6 |7 |8\n[GAME] Player 0 attempted an invalid move.
