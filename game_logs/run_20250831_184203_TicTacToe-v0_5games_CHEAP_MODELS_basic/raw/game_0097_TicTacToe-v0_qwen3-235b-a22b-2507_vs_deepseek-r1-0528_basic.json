The priority is to control key positions:\n\n- Opponent (O) controls center (4) and corner (8), creating diagonal threats.\n- I control corner (0). Taking another corner is strategically sound to balance control.\n- Move 6 is risky\u2014it creates a column threat but leaves opponent with a winning counter on the middle row (by playing 3 then 5).\n- Move 2 (top-right corner) pressures multiple lines: \n  - Threatens top row (X-?-X), forcing opponent to block at 1 on their next turn.\n  - Splays influence toward the diagonal (2-4-6), reducing opponent options.\n- It avoids immediate vulnerabilities, unlike other moves that risk opponent forks.\n\nThus, the optimal move is the corner at position 2 to maximize control and minimize counterplay.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] After analyzing the board:\n\n```plaintext\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n   | O |   \n---+---+---\n   |   | O \n```\n\n- The immediate threat: Opponent (O) has two in the middle column (positions 1 and 4). If they play cell 7 next, they win vertically (1-4-7). **This must be blocked to prevent a loss.**\n- No winning move exists for me (X) this turn\u2014no row, column, or diagonal can be completed in one move.\n- Other options:\n  - Playing corner cells (6 or 3) or middle-right (5) doesn't block the threat and allows opponent to win immediately next turn.\n  - A fork setup isn't feasible here, as ignoring cell 7 ensures opponent victory.\n\nThus, **blocking cell 7 is the only mandatory move** to stay in the game.  \n\n[7]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]'\n[Player 0] [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]'\n[Player 1] After analyzing the current board:\n\n```plaintext\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n```\n\n- **Critical Threat**: Opponent (O) can win immediately by playing cell 5, completing the middle row (O-O-O at positions 3-4-5). This must be blocked to prevent defeat.  \n- **No Winning Moves for X**:  \n  - Playing cell 6 creates a bottom row of X-X-O (not a win).  \n  - Playing cell 5 blocks the threat but doesn't create a winning line for X.  \n- **Outcome**: Blocking cell 5 forces the game into a draw, as opponent\u2019s only remaining move (cell 6) completes the board without a winner.  \n\n**Move**: Block the winning threat at position 5.  \n\n[5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[6]'",
