The opponent, 'O', has already placed their mark in position 4. A good strategy is to control the center or block the opponent's potential three-in-a-row while trying to create my own.\n\nGiven that the center is occupied by 'O', I will choose a corner to increase my chances of winning and limit 'O's potential.

If 'O' gets to place their mark in either position 0 or 3, they could potentially create a strong line.
