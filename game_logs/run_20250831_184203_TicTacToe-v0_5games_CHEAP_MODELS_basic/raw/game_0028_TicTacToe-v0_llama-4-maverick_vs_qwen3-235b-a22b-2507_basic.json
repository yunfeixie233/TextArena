Given that 'X' has taken position 0, I should consider a strategic response. A good strategy is to control the center or the corners and to develop a row or block the opponent's row.\n\nSince I've already placed my 'O' in the center (position 4), I will now look to secure a corner or a strategic position that can potentially create a winning line or block 'X' from doing so. \n\nConsidering the corners, positions 2, 6, and 8 are available. Position 8 is quite far from 'X' in position 0, so it might not be the most immediate choice unless it sets up a potential win or blocks a potential 'X' win.\n\nLet's examine other available strategic positions. Given 'X' is in position 0, a reasonable response could be to place 'O' in position 2 or position 6 (or 8) to potentially set up for a win or maintain flexibility.\n\nHowever, a more straightforward approach is to place 'O' in one of the available positions that are directly adjacent or relevant to the current 'O' in position 4 or challenge 'X'. \n\nLet's place 'O' in position 2.\n\nMy move: [2]\n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nPlease let me know the next state of the board after your next move (as Player 1).\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1]  [6]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] It looks like there's been a mistake in the game state.
