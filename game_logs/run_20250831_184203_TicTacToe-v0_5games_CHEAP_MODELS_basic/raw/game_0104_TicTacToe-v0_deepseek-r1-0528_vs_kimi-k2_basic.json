Playing in cell 7 (bottom middle) offers a symmetrical opportunity: Opponent may choose cell 1 (leading to a draw) or cell 8 (allowing me to win via column 1 with cell 1).  \n\nDecision:  \n- Given the opponent\u2019s historical preference for corners (they played 0 and 6, both corners), they may prioritize the open corner cell 8 over edge cells (1 or 7).

The opponent's X at 0 threatens the top row (by taking 1 next) or the left column (by taking 3 or 6). I need to block threats while setting up a win.\n- Taking a corner is optimal. The corners are 2, 6, and 8 (cell 0 is taken by X).\n- Cell 2 is particularly strong because:\n  - It blocks the opponent from easily winning the top row (0+1+2), as they now can't complete it without my interference.\n  - It gives me a potential diagonal win (2+4+6), forcing the opponent to respond defensively.\n- Alternative corners (6 or 8) are strong but less aggressive; they don't immediately threaten a win or block a critical row.\n\nThus, I choose cell 2 to maximize tactical pressure.
