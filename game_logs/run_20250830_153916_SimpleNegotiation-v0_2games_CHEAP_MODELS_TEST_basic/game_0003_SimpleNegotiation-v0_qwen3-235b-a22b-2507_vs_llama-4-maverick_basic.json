Considering the values, trading something less valuable for something more valuable is the goal.\n\nLet's evaluate potential trades:\n- Trading [Wheat] (Value: 6) for other resources could be beneficial if we get something more valuable.\n- [Sheep] (Value: 12) is relatively less valuable than [Ore] (Value: 38) but more than [Wheat] and [Wood].\n\nA potential trade could involve offering [Wheat] or [Sheep] for a resource with a higher value or a quantity that increases the total value.\n\n### New Trade Offer\n\nConsidering the current quantities and values, a potential trade could be:\n- Offering 8 [Wheat] (Value: 8 * 6 = 48) for 4 [Wood] (Value: 4 * 11 = 44) is not beneficial.\n- Offering 6 [Sheep] (Value: 6 * 12 = 72) for 2 [Ore] (Value: 2 * 38 = 76) is slightly beneficial but reduces [Sheep] quantity significantly.\n\nLet's propose a trade that might be beneficial:\n[Offer: 12 Wheat -> 4 Wood]\n\nThis trade involves:\n- Giving away 12 [Wheat] (Value: 12 * 6 = 72)\n- Receiving 4 [Wood] (Value: 4 * 11 = 44)\n\nThe net loss would be 72 - 44 = 28, which is not beneficial.\n\nLet's adjust the thought process:\nConsidering the previous successful trade, another potential trade could involve [Sheep] and [Ore].\n\n### Action\n\nLet's make a new offer:\n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis involves giving away 4 [Sheep] (Value: 4 * 12 = 48) and receiving 1 [Ore] (Value: 1 * 38 = 38), resulting in a net loss of 10.\n\nHowever, let's directly check the available action tokens and use them to decide on a trade.\n\n### Output\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 3 Ore] \n\nLet's see the response from Player 0.",
