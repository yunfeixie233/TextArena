      "response": "Alright, let me think about this. After the first few trades, here's where I stand:\n\n**Current Resources and Values:**\n- Wheat: 10 (value: 6)\n- Wood: 14 (value: 10)\n- Sheep: 14 (down from 17 due to the last trade, value: 14)\n- Brick: 8 (up from 5, value: 20)\n- Ore: 8 (value: 39)\n\nMy goal is to maximize the total value of my resources. Looking at Player 1's last offer (5 Wheat, 2 Wood \u2192 2 Ore), I rejected it because giving up 2 Ore (value: 78) for 5 Wheat and 2 Wood (total value: 30 + 20 = 50) would actually *decrease* my total value by 28. Good reject.\n\n**Strategy going forward:**\n- Ore is my highest-value resource (39 per unit), so I should avoid trading it away unless it's for an *exceptional* deal.\n- Brick is valuable (20) but I'm already at 8 units - might be a good commodity to trade *down* for other high-value resources.\n- Sheep and Wood have lower individual values, but I have plenty (14 Sheep, 14 Wood), making them good trading fodder.\n- Wheat is abundant and lowest value - could bundle it in offers.\n\n**Next Move:**\nSince Player 1 seems to want Ore (offered last time), but I want to keep it, perhaps I can offload some Sheep/Wood instead. I could offer to trade away some excess Sheep or Wheat for Brick (which I already have a good supply of) or perhaps more Ore.\n\nBut I need to be careful - Player 1 just saw me reject an Ore-heavy offer, so they know I value Ore highly. Let me try offering some Sheep/Wood for Brick, since I already have Brick and might not need more, but it's possible Player 1 values Brick more than I do.\n\nWait, let me check my current totals:\n- Current value: (10\u00d76) + (14\u00d710) + (14\u00d714) + (8\u00d720) + (8\u00d739) = 60 + 140 + 196 + 160 + 312 = 868\n\nHmm, maybe I should actually try to get more Ore. It's my highest multiplier. But Player 1 seems to want Ore too. Perhaps I should try a different tack.\n\nActually, looking at my Brick count (8 units), maybe I can afford to trade some Brick away since its value is \"only\" 20, and use it to get more Ore. But Player 1 isn't offering Brick right now.\n\nLet me try offering some of my Wood for Brick, since Wood has value 10 and Brick has 20 - if I can get even 1 Brick for 1 Wood, that's a value increase.\n\nBut I should be more strategic. Maybe offer a bundle that seems appealing:\n\nI could offer [2 Sheep, 2 Wood \u2192 3 Brick]. That would cost me 2\u00d714 + 2\u00d710 = 28 + 20 = 48 in outgoing value, and I'd gain 3\u00d720 = 60 in incoming value, a net gain of +12. This seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, since I have plenty of Sheep, maybe [3 Sheep \u2192 4 Brick] (42 \u2192 80, net +38), but that might be too aggressive and easily rejected.\n\nLet me go with the first more modest proposal to test Player 1's openness:\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]",
