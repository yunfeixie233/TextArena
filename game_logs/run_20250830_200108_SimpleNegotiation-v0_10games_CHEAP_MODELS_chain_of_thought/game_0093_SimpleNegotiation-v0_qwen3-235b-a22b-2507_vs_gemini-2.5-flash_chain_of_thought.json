Player 0 rejected this.\nYou have the following resources and values:\nWheat: 5 units (Value: 5 per unit)\nWood: 18 units (Value: 10 per unit)\nSheep: 20 units (Value: 16 per unit)\nBrick: 13 units (Value: 23 per unit)\nOre: 8 units (Value: 38 per unit)\n\nIt's your turn to make an offer. What is your next move?\n\n[Offer: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Brick, 1 Ore -> 5 Brick] was rejected. This implies that either the offer was not good enough for Player 0, or Player 0 doesn't have 5 Brick to trade, or Player 0 prioritizes keeping Brick.\n\nConsidering your goal is to increase the total value of your resources, you should aim to trade away lower-value items for higher-value items.\nLet's analyze value.\nWheat: 5\nWood: 10\nSheep: 16\nBrick: 23\nOre: 38\n\nYou have a lot of Sheep and Wood, which are relatively low in value. Brick and Ore are high value.\nLet's try to get more Ore or Brick.\n\nPlayer 0 might not have a lot of Brick. Or the previous offer was simply not appealing.\nCurrent offer: 1 Wheat (5) + 1 Wood (10) + 1 Sheep (16) + 1 Brick (23) + 1 Ore (38) = 92\nRequested: 5 Brick (5 * 23 = 115)\nThis implies you are offering 92 value to gain 115 value. This is a good trade for you if it goes through.\n\nLet's try to offer something that might be more appealing to Player 0 while still being good for you.\nWhat if Player 0 needs Wood or Sheep?\n\nPerhaps a simpler trade is better.\n\nConsider offering more of your abundant, low-value resources for higher-value ones.\nYou have 18 Wood and 20 Sheep.\n\nHow about offering a significant amount of Wood for Ore?\nOr Sheep for Brick?\n\nLet's try trading low-value items for high-value items directly.\n\nValue of 1 Ore = 38\nValue of 1 Brick = 23\nValue of 1 Sheep = 16\nValue of 1 Wood = 10\nValue of 1 Wheat = 5\n\nMaybe try to get Ore.\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (2 * 10) + (2 * 16) = 20 + 32 = 52\nValue requested: 1 * 38 = 38\nThis is not good for you value-wise. You are offering 52 for 38.\n\nLet's rethink. You want to get *more* value than you give up.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nValue offered: (2 * 10) + (1 * 16) = 20 + 16 = 36\nValue requested: 1 * 23 = 23\nStill no. You lose 13 value. This is only appealing to Player 0.\n\nYou need to offer items whose total value is *less* than the value of the items you request.\n\nHow about offering many low-value items for one high-value item, or a few high-value items for one even higher-value item?\n\nYou have a lot of Sheep and Wood.\nWhat if Player 0 needs Wood or Sheep?\n\nLet's try a very simple trade: offering two lower-value items for one higher-value item.\n[Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nValue offered: 10 + 16 = 26\nValue requested: 23\nThis is still bad for you. You lose 3 value.\n\nThis suggests that you need to be very careful with your offers.\nThe previous offer you made:\n[Offer: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Brick, 1 Ore -> 5 Brick]\nValue: 5+10+16+23+38 = 92\nRequested: 5 Brick = 5*23 = 115\nThis was a good offer for you (you would gain 23 value). Player 0 rejected it.\n\nPerhaps Player 0 does not have many Brick or needs Brick.\n\nLet's try to get Ore. Ore is the most valuable.\nYou have 8 Ore yourself.\n\nWhat if we try to trade Sheep and Wood for Ore?\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (3 * 16) + (1 * 10) = 48 + 10 = 58\nValue requested: 1 * 38 = 38\nBad for you.\n\nThis is tricky. You have to consider what Player 0 might need, and also make it beneficial for yourself.\n\nMaybe offer a lot of low-value items for Brick.\nValue of 1 Brick = 23.\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick]\nValue offered: 3 * 10 = 30\nValue requested: 23\nStill bad for you.\n\nThis seems to suggest that you need high-value items to trade for other high-value items optimally.\n\nLet's revisit the previous turn.\nPlayer 0 offered: 10 Sheep, 5 Ore -> 7 Brick, 3 Wheat.\nPlayer 1 rejected.\nLet's analyze Player 0's offer:\nValue offered by P0: (10 * 16) + (5 * 38) = 160 + 190 = 350\nValue requested by P0: (7 * 23) + (3 * 5) = 161 + 15 = 176\nP0 was offering 350 to get 176. This was a bad offer for Player 0 (good for P1 if accepted). No wonder P1 rejected this initially, but it was stated that P1 rejected the trade offer, but the description before that said P1 *rejected* the offer, so it was P0 offering (from P0's perspective) 10 Sheep, 5 Ore FOR 7 Brick, 3 Wheat. This means P0 gives 10 Sheep and 5 Ore. P1 gives 7 Brick and 3 Wheat.\n\nSo, for P1 (you):\nValue gained: (10 * 16) + (5 * 38) = 160 + 190 = 350\nValue lost: (7 * 23) + (3 * 5) = 161 + 15 = 176\nNet gain for P1 = 350 - 176 = 174.\nThis was a GREAT offer for you! You should have accepted it!\nWhy did you reject it? The history states: \"Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\"\n\nOkay, let's assume given the game state description that Player 1 rejected the previous good offer. This is a game where mistakes can be made.\n\nNow, it's your turn. You need to make an offer.\nYour last offer: [Offer: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Brick, 1 Ore -> 5 Brick] was rejected.\nThis offer was: you give 92 value, you get 115 value. A gain of 23 value for you.\n\nPlayer 0 rejected it. This likely means Player 0 either needs those resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep, Ore) or doesn't have 5 Brick to spare, or finds giving 5 Brick for that appealing.\n\nLet's try to offer a more simplified offer, and possibly one that P0 will see as beneficial to them, but still net positive for you.\n\nYou have abundant Sheep (20) and Wood (18).\nYou want more high-value items (Brick, Ore).\n\nHow about trading a lot of low-value items for one mid-to-high value item?\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\nValue offered: (3 * 10) + (3 * 16) = 30 + 48 = 78\nValue requested: 2 * 23 = 46\nThis is bad for you (you lose value).\n\nI need to make an offer where your gain is significant enough for you, but P0 might still accept it.\n\nWhat if Player 0 needs Wheat? You have 5 Wheat.\nAnd you want Ore.\n\n[Offer: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 5 + 10 + 16 = 31\nValue requested: 38\nThis is good for you! You gain 7 value.\nThis might be appealing to Player 0 if they need Wheat, Wood, or Sheep.\n\nLet's try this. It's a clear gain for you if accepted.\n\nAre there any other constraints on offers? No.\n\nThe goal is to increase value.\nYour current total value:\n5 * 5 = 25 (Wheat)\n18 * 10 = 180 (Wood)\n20 * 16 = 320 (Sheep)\n13 * 23 = 299 (Brick)\n8 * 38 = 304 (Ore)\nTotal = 25+180+320+299+304 = 1128\n\nIf the proposed trade: [Offer: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore] goes through:\nYou lose 1 Wheat (5), 1 Wood (10), 1 Sheep (16) = 31 value\nYou gain 1 Ore (38) = 38 value\nNet gain = 7 value.\nYour new total value would be 1128 + 7 = 1135.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable offer to make, as it directly benefits your goal and uses existing resources.\n\nFinal check on format: `[Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]`.\n\n`[Offer: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`",
