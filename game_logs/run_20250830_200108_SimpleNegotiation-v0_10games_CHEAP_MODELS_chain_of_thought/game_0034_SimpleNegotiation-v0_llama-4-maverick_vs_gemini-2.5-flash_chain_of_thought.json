      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to strategically analyze the resources I have and potentially make trades that increase their total value. Let's start by assessing the current situation:\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 18 units, Value: 6 per unit\n   - Wood: 11 units, Value: 11 per unit\n   - Sheep: 15 units, Value: 16 per unit\n   - Brick: 12 units, Value: 23 per unit\n   - Ore: 22 units, Value: 38 per unit\n\n2. **Total Value:** \n   - Wheat: 18 * 6 = 108\n   - Wood: 11 * 11 = 121\n   - Sheep: 15 * 16 = 240\n   - Brick: 12 * 23 = 276\n   - Ore: 22 * 38 = 836\n   - Total Value = 108 + 121 + 240 + 276 + 836 = 1581\n\n3. **Initial Observation:**\n   - Ore has the highest value per unit, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n   - To increase the total value, I should aim to acquire resources with higher value per unit if possible.\n\n4. **First Turn Strategy:**\n   - Since Ore is the most valuable resource and I already have a substantial amount of it (22 units), I should be cautious not to give away too much Ore.\n   - I have a moderate amount of Sheep and Brick, which are also valuable.\n   - Wheat is the least valuable resource per unit, so it might be a good candidate for trading away if I can get a more valuable resource in return.\n\n5. **Trade Offer for Turn 1:**\n   - Considering the values, a potential trade could involve offering some Wheat (the least valuable resource) in exchange for something more valuable.\n   - Let's propose: '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]' or potentially '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]' if we believe the opponent values Wheat and can offer a decent resource in return.\n\nLet's start with: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis is a calculated risk to see if the opponent is willing to make a trade that slightly increases my total value. If they accept, I'll gain a bit more value (1 Brick = 23, and 5 Wheat = 30, so it's a slight loss, but let's adjust our strategy based on their response).\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response to adjust our next move accordingly. \n\nFor now, my action is: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`",

Offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore (Accepted in reverse by Player 1)\n\nWe should look for a trade that increases the total value of resources. \n\nTo do this, we need to consider the values of the resources and look for potential trades that could be beneficial.\n\nLet's evaluate the current resources and potential trades:\n- The highest value resource is Ore (Value: 38), and we have 24 of it.\n- The lowest value resource we have is Wheat (Value: 6), and we have 18 of it.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some of the lower-value resources or resources we have in relatively higher quantities for resources that are either more valuable or could potentially be used for a better trade later.\n\nSince we just received 2 Ore for 2 Sheep, we might want to consider if we can offer some of our other resources for something more valuable.\n\nLet's examine possible trades:\n1. We could offer Wheat (the lowest value resource) for other resources.\n2. We could consider offering some Wood for a more valuable resource since Wood (Value: 11) is also relatively less valuable compared to Sheep, Brick, and Ore.\n\nLet's consider a potential trade offer:\n- Offering 4 Wheat (Value: 6 * 4 = 24) for 1 Wood (Value: 11) was previously rejected, so we might need a better offer or a different resource to request.\n\nLet's directly propose a trade that we think could be beneficial.\nA possible trade could be: [Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n\nThis trade involves giving away:\n- 3 Wheat = 3 * 6 = 18\n- 1 Wood = 1 * 11 = 11\nTotal given away = 18 + 11 = 29\n\nAnd receiving:\n- 1 Brick = 1 * 23 = 23\n\nThis trade doesn't seem beneficial since we're giving away more value than we're getting.\n\nLet's try to think of a more beneficial trade.\n\nSince our last trade was beneficial (gaining 2 Ore for 2 Sheep), and we now have more Ore, let's think about using some of our abundant resources.\n\nLet's directly propose a potentially beneficial trade:\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis involves:\n- Giving away 2 Wheat = 2 * 6 = 12\n- Giving away 1 Brick = 1 * 23 = 23\nTotal given away = 12 + 23 = 35\n\n- Receiving 1 Ore = 1 * 38 = 38\n\nThis trade gives us a net gain of 38 - 35 = 3 in value.\n\nSo, the action for this turn could be: \n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
