      "response": "### Negotiation Game: Initial Analysis\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: Qty: 9, Value: 6\n- Wood: Qty: 17, Value: 11\n- Sheep: Qty: 21, Value: 17\n- Brick: Qty: 5, Value: 26\n- Ore: Qty: 15, Value: 35\n\n#### Total Current Value:\nTo determine the total current value, we need to multiply the quantity of each resource by its value and sum these products.\n- Total Value = (9*6) + (17*11) + (21*17) + (5*26) + (15*35)\n- Total Value = 54 + 187 + 357 + 130 + 525 = 1253\n\n#### Objective:\nThe goal is to increase the total value of the resources through trades.\n\n#### Initial Strategy:\n1. **Identify Overvalued and Undervalued Resources:** Based on the given values, Ore is the most valuable resource, and Wheat is the least. We should try to acquire more of the higher-value resources if possible and be cautious about losing the resources with higher values.\n\n2. **Analyze Potential Trades:** We should look for opportunities to trade resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable or at least maintain the value while possibly gaining quantity in a resource that could be traded further for a gain.\n\n3. **First Offer:** Let's analyze what we can offer. We have a surplus of Sheep and a good quantity of Ore and Wood. We are low on Brick. A potential trade could involve offering some of our abundant resources for Brick or other high-value resources.\n\n#### Proposed Action for Turn 1:\nLet's make an offer that could potentially increase our total value. We have a good quantity of Wood and Sheep. Let's offer some Wood for Brick since Brick is more valuable.\n- **Offer:** `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Brick]`\n  \nThis offer reduces our Wood quantity by 4 (from 17 to 13) and increases our Brick quantity by 2 (from 5 to 7). Let's see how the opponent responds.\n\n#### Rationale:\n- We are giving up Wood (Value: 11) and gaining Brick (Value: 26). \n- The trade involves losing 4*11 = 44 value in Wood and gaining 2*26 = 52 value in Brick, resulting in a net gain of 8.\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response to our offer. If they accept, we'll proceed with the trade. If they deny or make a counteroffer, we'll reassess based on their action.\n\nSince the format requires a specific action, I will proceed with the offer.\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Ore -> 2 Brick]` was modified for clarity to `[Offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Brick]` to adhere to the format specified. However, to exactly follow the format given:\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Brick]`",

This is a small gain. I have 6 Wood. This would use almost all my Wood.\n\nLet's consider trading Sheep and Wood for Ore.\nOffer: 3 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore\nValue of 3 Sheep: 3 * 12 = 36\nValue of 3 Wood: 3 * 10 = 30\nTotal offered value: 66\nValue of 2 Ore: 2 * 34 = 68\nThis is a gain of 2 value for me.

      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the current state of resources\nThe current resources and their values are:\n- Wheat: 9, Value: 6\n- Wood: 17, Value: 11\n- Sheep: 21, Value: 17\n- Brick: 5, Value: 26\n- Ore: 15, Value: 35\n\nAfter the last accepted trade (3 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore), the quantities changed. Let's update the resources:\n- Given: 3 Sheep, 3 Wood\n- Received: 2 Ore\nSo, the new quantities are:\n- Wheat: 9\n- Wood: 17 - 3 = 14\n- Sheep: 21 - 3 = 18\n- Brick: 5\n- Ore: 15 + 2 = 17\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the current total value of resources\nLet's calculate the total value after the trade:\n- Wheat: 9 * 6 = 54\n- Wood: 14 * 11 = 154\n- Sheep: 18 * 17 = 306\n- Brick: 5 * 26 = 130\n- Ore: 17 * 35 = 595\nTotal Value = 54 + 154 + 306 + 130 + 595 = 1239\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the last trade offers and rejections\nThe last offer from Player 1 was: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore. This was rejected by Player 0.\nLet's analyze if accepting it would be beneficial:\n- Giving: 1 Ore (Value: 35)\n- Receiving: 5 Wheat (Value: 5 * 6 = 30)\nSince 35 > 30, accepting this offer would decrease the total value, so rejecting it was a good decision.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the next trade offer\nWe need to think about what we can offer or request to increase our total value.\nLet's examine our resources and possible trades:\n- We have a lot of Sheep and Ore, and a decent amount of Wood.\n- Brick is valuable, so getting more Brick could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a trade offer\nConsidering our resources and the value of Brick, let's think about offering something for Brick.\nOne possible trade could involve offering some of our less valuable resources (in terms of total value or quantity) for Brick.\n\n## Step 6: Check if we can offer something for Brick\nLet's see if we can make an offer for Brick using our current resources.\nWe've already tried offering Wood for Brick (4 Wood -> 2 Brick) and Sheep for Brick (4 Sheep -> 2 Brick), and both were rejected.\nLet's think about other combinations.\n\n## Step 7: Consider an alternative trade\nSince our previous offers for Brick were rejected, let's consider what else we can trade.\nWe could offer Wheat for something valuable. However, Wheat is not very valuable.\n\n## Step 8: Make a new trade offer\nLet's offer some Wheat and Wood for Brick, as we have a surplus of Wood and Wheat is not very valuable:\n- Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick\nCalculating the value:\n- Giving: 5 Wheat (5*6 = 30), 2 Wood (2*11 = 22), Total = 30 + 22 = 52\n- Receiving: 2 Brick (2*26 = 52)\nThis trade doesn't increase our total value, so it's not beneficial.\n\n## Step 9: Reconsider our resources and think about a different trade\nLet's think about other possible trades that could be beneficial.\nWe have a lot of Sheep. Let's consider offering Sheep for Ore, but we already have a lot of Ore.\nLet's directly formulate a trade offer based on our analysis.\n\n## Step 10: Decide on a trade offer\nLet's offer: [Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\n- Giving: 4 Wood (4*11 = 44), 2 Sheep (2*17 = 34), Total = 44 + 34 = 78\n- Receiving: 2 Brick (2*26 = 52)\nThis trade is not beneficial as it decreases our total value.\n\n## Step 11: Adjust our strategy\nLet's directly make a new offer based on the current situation and our resources.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick]}$",
