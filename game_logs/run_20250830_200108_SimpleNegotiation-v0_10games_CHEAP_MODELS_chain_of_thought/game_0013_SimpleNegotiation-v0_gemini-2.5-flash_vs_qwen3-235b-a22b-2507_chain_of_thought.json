      "response": "My current resources are:\n\t+ Wheat: 5 (Value: 5)\n\t+ Wood: 21 (Value: 10)\n\t+ Sheep: 11 (Value: 17)\n\t+ Brick: 23 (Value: 26)\n\t+ Ore: 6 (Value: 37)\n\nThe previous offer of 5 Wheat and 10 Wood for 3 Ore and 2 Brick was rejected. It seems Player 1 doesn't want to part with Ore and Brick for Wheat and Wood.\n\nMy objective is to increase the total value of my resources. Ore (37) and Brick (26) are highly valued. Wheat (5) and Wood (10) are less valued.\n\nLet's try to trade something I have in abundance and is lower value, for something higher value. I have a lot of Wood (21) and Brick (23).\n\nPlayer 1 hasn't made an offer, so I need to initiate.\n\nConsiderations for the next offer:\n*   I want to acquire more high-value resources like Ore or Sheep.\n*   I have a good amount of Wood and Brick.\n*   The previous offer of low-value items for high-value items was rejected. Maybe Player 1 needs something I have that's not Wheat or Wood.\n\nLet's try to offer some of my Brick for their Ore. I have 23 Brick, which is a good quantity.\n\nProposal: Offer a significant amount of Brick for a smaller amount of Ore.\nFor example, 5 Brick (value 5*26 = 130) for 2 Ore (value 2*37 = 74). This is good for Player 1, but maybe too much for me.\nLet's try to make it more balanced, but still beneficial to me.\n\nHow about offering Wood for Ore? I have 21 Wood.\nMaybe 10 Wood (value 10*10 = 100) for 2 Ore (value 2*37 = 74). Still not ideal for me.\n\nThe key is what Player 1 needs. Since I don't know, I'll try to tempt them with a resource I have plenty of and they might value, for a resource I value highly.\n\nLet's offer a combination of lower-value and higher-value resources that I have in abundance for something high value.\n\nI have 23 Brick. Maybe offer a small amount of Brick for some Ore.\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nMy side: -3 Brick (value 78). Their side: +1 Ore (value 37). This is a net loss in value for me. Bad idea.\n\nLet's rethink. I want to *increase* my total value.\nMy current total value: (5*5) + (21*10) + (11*17) + (23*26) + (6*37) = 25 + 210 + 187 + 598 + 222 = 1242.\n\nI need to offer less value than I receive.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix? Say Wood and Sheep for Ore.\nI have 21 Wood and 11 Sheep.\n\nLet's consider offering what Player 1 rejected last time, but in a different quantity or combination. They rejected 5 Wheat and 10 Wood for 3 Ore and 2 Brick. This suggests they didn't want to give up that much Ore and Brick for my low-value items.\n\nHow about I target Sheep or Ore? Sheep has a value of 17, Ore 37.\n\nLet's try to offer Wood for Sheep.\nI have plenty of Wood.\n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 4 Sheep]\nMy side: -10 Wood (value 100). Their side: +4 Sheep (value 68). This is bad for me.\n\nThe previous offer from Player 0 was 5 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 3 Ore, 2 Brick.\nValue out: 5*5 + 10*10 = 25 + 100 = 125\nValue in: 3*37 + 2*26 = 111 + 52 = 163\nThis was actually good for me (gain 38 value), so Player 1 rejecting it means the value proposition wasn't appealing *to them*, or they simply didn't need Wheat/Wood.\n\nLet's make an offer where I give up some high-quantity items for something higher value.\nI have a lot of Brick (23) and Wood (21). Ore is my highest value target.\n\nLet's try offering a larger quantity of lower-value items for fewer higher-value items.\nI have limited Wheat and Ore. I have a lot of Wood, Sheep, and Brick.\n\nMaybe Player 1 needs Brick or Sheep.\nIf I give up some Brick/Sheep, it has to be for something even more valuable.\n\nLet's propose:\n[Offer: 8 Wood, 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]\nMy side (out): 8 Wood (8*10=80) + 4 Sheep (4*17=68) = 148\nMy side (in): 2 Ore (2*37=74) + 1 Brick (1*26=26) = 100\nThis is a net loss of 48 value for me. Bad.\n\nWhat if I offer a resource that I have many of for a resource that I have few of, but is still valuable?\nI have 23 Brick and only 6 Ore.\n\nLet's try to increase my Ore count.\n[Offer: 4 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nMy value out: 4 * 26 = 104\nMy value in: 1 * 37 = 37\nAgain, bad for me. It means I have to give up a lot for a little, unless Player 1 is desperate.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 wants to profit too.\nI need to offer them something they value, for something I value more.\n\nLet's try to give up a mixed set of what I have in quantity for an Ore.\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nMy value out: (5*10) + (5*17) = 50 + 85 = 135\nMy value in: (1*37) = 37\nStill bad for me.\n\nThis means I can't just trade Wood or Sheep for Ore directly and gain value if I'm offering more value than I receive.\n\nI need to construct an offer where my \"value offered\" is less than my \"value received\".\n\nLet's rethink the quantities.\nMy target: Ore (value 37).\nWhat I have plenty of: Wood (10), Sheep (17), Brick (26).\n\nHow about: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]?\nMy value out: 2 * 17 = 34\nMy value in: 1 * 37 = 37\nThis means I gain 3 value. This sounds like a good simple offer to start with.\nI have 11 Sheep, so I can afford to lose 2.\n\nThis would be a good trade for me, and Player 1 would be giving up 37 value for 34 value. Why would they accept this? They wouldn't, unless they desperately need Sheep.\n\nSo, the previous offer I considered (5 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 3 Ore, 2 Brick) was a net gain of 38 value for me. Player 1 rejected it.\nThis implies Player 1 is also aiming for value gain, or they don't want to give up those specific high-value resources.\n\nLet's try to offer something Player 1 might actually want and make it appealing for *them*, while still being a net positive for me.\nPerhaps they have a surplus of something I value.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of lower-value and higher-value resources for an even higher-value resource?\nI have a lot of Brick.\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]\nValue out: 5*10 (Wood) + 3*26 (Brick) = 50 + 78 = 128\nValue in: 2*37 (Ore) = 74\nStill a huge loss for me.\n\nThis game is about finding a profitable trade.\nThe most straightforward way is to give up low-value items for high-value items, or a small quantity of high-value items for an even higher value quantity.\n\nI want more Ore. I have 6.\nI also have 5 Wheat. It's my lowest quantity AND lowest value.\nMaybe Player 1 needs wheat?\n\nWhat if I offer ALL my Wheat for something?\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]\nMy value out: 5 * 5 = 25\nMy value in: 1 * 17 = 17\nBad for me.\n\nThe original offer was good for me. Why rejected? Maybe because Wheat and Wood are undesirable.\nLet's try to make an offer where I give up resources in which I have high quantities, for resources that are more valuable.\n\nLet's target Ore. It's the most valuable per unit.\nI have 23 Brick (value 26). I have 11 Sheep (value 17). I have 21 Wood (value 10).\n\nTargeting 1 Ore (value 37):\nTo make it profitable for me, I need to offer less than 37 value.\nCan I offer anything valuable between 0 and 37 value?\n- 1 Sheep (17) -> 1 Ore? Value gain of 20 for me. This is too good. Player 1 will reject.\n- 2 Sheep (34) -> 1 Ore? Value gain of 3 for me. Player 1 value loss of 3. They will probably reject.\n\nWhat if I offer something Player 1 needs and make it an even trade or slightly profitable for me?\nMaybe Player 1 has a lot of Wood and Wheat, and needs Brick, Sheep, or Ore.\n\nLet's try to tempt Player 1 with Brick, which I have in abundance.\n[Offer: 4 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]\nMy value out: 4 * 26 = 104\nMy value in: 1 * 37 + 1 * 17 = 54\nMassive loss for me.\n\nThis is tough. If I offer good value for me, it's bad for Player 1. If I offer good value for Player 1, it's bad for me.\nThe only way to win is an imbalanced trade in my favour.\n\nWhat if I offer the least valuable resource I have, for the most valuable resource Player 1 has, but in quantities that seem balanced?\nI have few Wheat, Player 1 might have excess.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue out: 5*5 + 5*10 = 25 + 50 = 75\nValue in: 1*37 = 37\nThis is value loss for me.\n\nLet's make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me, but might appear reasonable to Player 1 based on perceived scarcity/abundance.\nMy current highest quantity resources are Wood and Brick.\nMy desired resources are Ore and Sheep.\n\nLet's try offering a generous quantity of Wood for a single Ore:\n[Offer: 8 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nMy value out: 8 * 10 = 80\nMy value in: 1 * 37 = 37\nNet loss for me.\n\nThis implies that directly trading lower value items for higher value items is likely a net loss for me unless the quantities are very skewed.\n\nLet's reconsider the last rejected offer: 5 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 3 Ore, 2 Brick.\nMy net gain was 38. Player 1 lost 38. That's why they rejected.\n\nI need to make an offer that is perceived as fair, but I still profit from.\nThe game is called Negotiation. So it's about finding a sweet spot.\n\nWhat if Player 1 is trying to get rid of something too?\nI have 23 Brick. Maybe Player 1 needs Brick?\nWhat if I offer some Brick for SOME Ore?\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nMy value out: 3 * 26 = 78\nMy value in: 1 * 37 = 37\nLoss of 41 value for me.\n\nThis strategy of offering a single target resource is hard if I want to profit.\nI need to get more value than I give.\n\nWhat if I offer something Player 1 is probably short on, but I have a lot of? e.g. Brick or Wood.\nLet's offer a larger quantity of Wood and Sheep for some Ore.\nI have 21 Wood and 11 Sheep.\n\nHow about: [Offer: 6 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Wheat]\nMy value out: 6*10 + 3*17 = 60 + 51 = 111\nMy value in: 1*37 + 1*5 = 37 + 5 = 42\nHorrible for me.\n\nOkay, I need to be more strategic. I need to make an offer that results in a net positive value for me.\nThe previous offer was good for me, but maybe too much of a loss for Player 1.\n38 value loss for Player 1.\n\nLet's try something more balanced in value, but still positive for me.\nTarget: acquire Ore. Ore is 37 value.\nWhat can I give up that is less than 37 value?\n- 1 Wheat (5)\n- 1 Wood (10)\n- 2 Wood (20)\n- 3 Wood (30)\n- 1 Sheep (17)\n- 2 Sheep (34)\n- 1 Brick (26)\n\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (34 value) for 1 Ore (37 value), I gain 3 value. Player 1 loses 3 value. This is the smallest potential trade that is beneficial to me.\nPlayer 0 has 11 Sheep. Can afford to lose 2. Has 6 Ore. Needs more.\nThis is a small enough loss for Player 1 that they *might* accept, especially if they are heavily invested in Sheep and want Ore.\n\nLet's try this. It's direct, simple, and profitable for me.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
