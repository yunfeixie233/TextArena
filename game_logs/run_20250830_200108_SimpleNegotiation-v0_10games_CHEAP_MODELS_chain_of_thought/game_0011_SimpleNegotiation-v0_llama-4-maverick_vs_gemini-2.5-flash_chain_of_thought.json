Later, I offered 3 Brick for 2 Wood, which was also rejected.\n\nFrom the negotiation history, it's clear that both Player 0 (me) and Player 1 are interested in trading Brick for Wood or vice versa, but we haven't agreed on a deal yet. Given that I've already reduced my Brick quantity by 4 (from 20 to 16) and my offers and counter-offers have been rejected, it's time to consider alternative trades or adjust the ratio.\n\nLet's think about the value:\n- Brick (Value: 25) is more valuable than Wood (Value: 12), so trading Brick for Wood isn't favorable in terms of value. However, it might still be beneficial if I can get a good ratio.\n\nConsidering my resources and the goal to increase the total value, I'll think about other possible trades.\n\nLet's directly examine a potential trade offer.\n\nSince we are stuck on the Brick and Wood trade, let's think about other resources.\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 4 Wood]' is an alternative. However, let's directly evaluate a reasonable trade.\n\nLet's offer: '[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 3 Wood]'.\n\nHowever, we can directly look at making a trade with a more reasonable resource.\n\n'[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Wood]'.\n\nThis is my next offer: '[Offer: 3 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 4 Wood]'.\n\nLet's see how it goes.\n\n'[Offer: 3 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 4 Wood]'.",
