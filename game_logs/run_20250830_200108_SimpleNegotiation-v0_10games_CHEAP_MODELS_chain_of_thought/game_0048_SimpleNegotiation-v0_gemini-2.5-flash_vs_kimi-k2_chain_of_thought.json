This is undeniably disadvantageous.\n\n**My response and next move**\n\nReject this offer and propose something beneficial to me.\n\nBased on the high value I hold in Ore (32 per unit) and Sheep (17 per unit), and my lower value Wood and Wheat, I could attempt this:\n- Give 2 Wood (value 22)\n- Get 1 Sheep (value 17)  \nUnfortunately, that\u2019s 22 \u2192 17, a loss of 5 value for me. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, I could offer to gain more Ore. Ore is highly valuable. I have lots of Brick (21 = 21 \u00d7 26 = high total value) which could be traded down.\n\nFor example:\n- Give 4 Brick (104 value)  \n- Get 3 Ore (96 value)\n\nThat\u2019s 104 \u2192 96, still a small loss. Not enough.\n\nLet me instead directly propose something that is *beneficial* to me (i.e., gives me more value than I offer).  \n\nA simple beneficial offer:\n- Give 3 Sheep (value 51)  \n- Get 2 Ore (value 64)  \n\nThat is 51 \u2192 64, *a net gain of 13 value*. Good for me, and arguably plausible for Player 0 since they might want Sheep for some purpose.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
