      "response": "### Negotiation Game Analysis and Action\n\n#### Initial Resources and Values\n\n- Wheat: 17 units, Value: 6\n- Wood: 25 units, Value: 8\n- Sheep: 10 units, Value: 18\n- Brick: 12 units, Value: 20\n- Ore: 5 units, Value: 34\n\n#### Current Total Value\n\nTo determine the current total value, we multiply the quantity of each resource by its value and sum these products.\n\n- Wheat: 17 * 6 = 102\n- Wood: 25 * 8 = 200\n- Sheep: 10 * 18 = 180\n- Brick: 12 * 20 = 240\n- Ore: 5 * 34 = 170\n\nTotal Value = 102 + 200 + 180 + 240 + 170 = 892\n\n#### Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value of resources, we should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given the values, Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\n#### Analysis of Potential Trades\n\n1. **Trading Wheat or Wood for higher-value resources**: Since Wheat and Wood have lower values, we can consider trading them for resources like Sheep, Brick, or Ore if possible.\n\n2. **Initial Offer**: We can start by offering Wheat or Wood in exchange for more valuable resources. Let's consider offering Wood (Value: 8) for Sheep (Value: 18) or Brick (Value: 20).\n\n#### Proposed Trade\n\nLet's propose a trade that involves offering some Wood for Sheep or Brick. \n\nGiven:\n- 3 Wood = 3 * 8 = 24 Value\n- 1 Sheep = 1 * 18 = 18 Value\n- 1 Brick = 1 * 20 = 20 Value\n\nTo make a reasonable offer, we could offer 3 Wood for 1 Sheep (since 24 is more than 18, this might not be favorable for the opponent) or adjust accordingly.\n\nLet's make an offer: `[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 3 Wood, 0 Wheat, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 1 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore]`\n\nHowever, to follow the exact format required for the action:\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nLet's execute this trade offer.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Sheep]`",

      "response": "## Step 1: Review the current state of resources after the trades.\nInitially, I have: Wheat = 17, Wood = 25, Sheep = 10, Brick = 12, Ore = 5. After trading 1 Ore for 4 Sheep, I have: Wheat = 17, Wood = 25, Sheep = 14, Brick = 12, Ore = 4. Then, I traded 1 Ore for 2 Sheep, so now I have: Wheat = 17, Wood = 25, Sheep = 16, Brick = 12, Ore = 3.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the current resources and their values.\nThe current resources and their values are: Wheat (17, Value: 6), Wood (25, Value: 8), Sheep (16, Value: 18), Brick (12, Value: 20), Ore (3, Value: 34). Let's calculate the total value: (17*6) + (25*8) + (16*18) + (12*20) + (3*34) = 102 + 200 + 288 + 240 + 102 = 932.\n\n## Step 3: Consider potential trades based on the current resources and values.\nTo increase the total value, I should look for trades that give me higher value resources or reduce the quantity of lower value resources. Given the values, Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze possible trade offers.\nSince I have 3 Ore left, which is very valuable, I should be cautious about trading it away. I could offer some Sheep or Wood for more Ore or other valuable resources, but Player 1's last offer was 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, which I rejected. Considering my resources, offering Wood or Sheep for Ore or Brick could be a good strategy.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a trade offer for the current turn.\nGiven that I have 25 Wood and the value of Wood is relatively low, I could offer some Wood for a more valuable resource. Player 1 previously offered 2 Wood for 1 Ore, which I rejected. However, considering my current state (3 Ore, 16 Sheep), I might offer something like Wood for Ore or Sheep for Brick.\n\n## Step 6: Decide on a specific trade offer.\nLet's offer 3 Wood for 1 Ore. The current value of 3 Wood is 3*8 = 24, and 1 Ore is worth 34. This seems like a good trade because I'm gaining 10 in value. So, the offer could be: [Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore].\n\n## Step 7: Check if the proposed trade is within the current resources.\nI have 25 Wood, so offering 3 Wood is feasible. I have 3 Ore, so requesting 1 Ore is also feasible for Player 1 if they accept.\n\n## Step 8: Format the trade offer according to the game's special tokens.\nThe trade offer should be formatted as: [Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore].\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]}$",
