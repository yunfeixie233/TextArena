      "response": "As Player 1, I need to strategically trade to maximize my total resource value. My current resources are:\n- **Wood**: 5  \n- **Sheep**: 14  \n- **Brick**: 14  \n- **Ore**: 23  \n\nI've had success in previous turns by trading Sheep and Wood for Ore, which has a high value per unit (40). Player 0 has repeatedly accepted such offers, indicating they may value Sheep and Wood for their own purposes, even at a slight loss in net exchange value. Since I now have no Wheat, I'll propose a trade using my available resources to acquire more Ore.  \n\n**Trade proposal**: Offer 5 Wood and 4 Sheep for 3 Ore.  \n- **Why this trade?**  \n  - Current value given: 5 Wood (5 \u00d7 8 = 40) + 4 Sheep (4 \u00d7 12 = 48) = 88 total  \n  - Value gained: 3 Ore (3 \u00d7 40 = 120)  \n  - **Net gain**: 120 - 88 = 32 (improves my total value)  \n- **Risk**: Player 0 has accepted similar offers but may reject without Wheat. If accepted, this leaves me with 0 Wood and 10 Sheep, but I gain 3 Ore (26 total Ore), further concentrating my resources in higher-value items.  \n\n**Action**:  \n[Offer: 5 Wood, 4 Sheep -> 3 Ore]",
