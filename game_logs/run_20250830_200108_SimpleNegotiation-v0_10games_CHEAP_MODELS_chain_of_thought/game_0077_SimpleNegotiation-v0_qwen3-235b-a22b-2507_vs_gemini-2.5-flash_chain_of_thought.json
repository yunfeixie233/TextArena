      "response": "Player 1's resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 22   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 22   Value: 12\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 21   Value: 15\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 9    Value: 20\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 14   Value: 35\nPlayer 1's total value: 1613\n\nI need to increase my total value. My Ore is very valuable, and I have a decent amount. Brick is also good. Wheat, Wood, and Sheep are relatively low value. I have a lot of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep.\n\nPlayer 0 rejected my last offer of 10 Ore for 7 Brick and 5 Wood. This suggests they might not value Brick and Wood as much as I do, or they just don't have enough to offer for 10 Ore. The value of my offer was 350, and their requested items were worth 140+60=200, so it was a good deal for me.\n\nThe previous offers by Player 0 were:\n1. 10 Brick -> 5 Wheat, 3 Wood (rejected by Player 1) - Their offer of 10 Brick is worth 200. My items were worth 25+36=61. This was a bad deal for me.\n2. No new offer from Player 0 (rejected by Player 1 by default).\n\nMy last offer was quite aggressive. I will try to make an offer that is more balanced, but still beneficial to me.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Wood. I want to acquire more Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's try to trade some of my low-value resources for higher value ones.\nWhat if I offer a mix of my plentiful lower-value resources for Brick or Ore?\n\nConsider offering a larger quantity of lower-value resources for a smaller quantity of higher-value ones.\nOr, I could offer some Sheep, which is mid-value, along with Wheat/Wood.\n\nLet's look at relative values.\n1 Ore (35) is roughly equivalent to 2 Brick (40) or 3 Wood (36) or 7 Wheat (35).\n\nI need to reduce my low-value resources and gain high-value resources.\nI have 22 Wheat (Value 110)\nI have 22 Wood (Value 264)\nI have 21 Sheep (Value 315)\nI have 9 Brick (Value 180) - This is low quantity. I want more.\nI have 14 Ore (Value 490) - This is good quantity.\n\nI could try to get more Brick.\nWhat if I offer Wood and Sheep for Brick?\n\nIf I offer 3 Wood (36) and 2 Sheep (30) = 66 value, for 3 Brick (60) = 60 value. This is a very slightly negative trade for me, but it diversifies my resources towards a higher value type. Player 0 might accept this.\n\nLet's try:\nOffer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick.\nMy side: 3*12 + 2*15 = 36 + 30 = 66\nTheir side: 3*20 = 60\nThis is a small loss for me in value, but it converts lower-value goods into higher-value goods (from 12/unit and 15/unit to 20/unit). This could be beneficial in the long run.\n\nOr, what if I push for more Brick?\nOffer: 5 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 4 Brick\nMy side: 5*12 + 3*15 = 60 + 45 = 105\nTheir side: 4*20 = 80\nThis is a larger value difference, but I am shedding a lot of Wood and Sheep. Player 0 might not accept this given my last aggressive offer.\n\nI should try to offer something that benefits Player 0 slightly while benefiting me by getting rid of low-value resources and gaining higher-value ones.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, since it's the highest value. But Player 0 rejected my Ore offer before, so they might not have much.\n\nLet's go back to Brick. I only have 9 Brick, so increasing this is good.\nWhat if I offer Wheat and Wood for Brick?\nOffer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 3 Brick\nMy side: 5*5 + 3*12 = 25 + 36 = 61\nTheir side: 3*20 = 60\nThis is a nearly neutral value trade. It gets rid of low-value resources (Wheat and Wood) and gets me more Brick. This seems like a reasonable offer for Player 0 to accept.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 3 Brick]",
