It seems favorable.\n\n**Caveats:**  \n- It uses up **5 Wheat and 3 Wood**\u2014our two lowest-value, yet somewhat scarce resources.  \n- Sheep is moderately valued (18) and we currently have 5 Sheep. Gaining 4 more would raise our Sheep to 9, which is not overwhelming.\n\nSince it\u2019s a clear +23 and it preserved higher-value items (Brick/Ore), I\u2019ll accept this.\n\n[Accept]",
