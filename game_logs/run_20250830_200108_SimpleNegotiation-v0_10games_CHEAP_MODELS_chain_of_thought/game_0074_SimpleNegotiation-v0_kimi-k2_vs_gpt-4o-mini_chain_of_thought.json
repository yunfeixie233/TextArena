For example:\n- **Offer**: 4 Sheep (low value relative to quantity) \u2192 3 Wood (high value per unit).  \n- **Net Gain**: (3 \u00d7 11) - (4 \u00d7 14) = 33 - 56 = **-23 value**. Not viable.\n\n#### Reverse Scenario:\nIf Player 1 needs **Ore** (high value), offer **lower-value Sheep** for **higher-value Ore**.\n- **Sample Offer**: 5 Sheep \u2192 3 Ore  \n- **Net Gain**: (3 \u00d7 33) - (5 \u00d7 14) = 99 - 70 = **+29 value**.  \n\nThis is much better.
