      "response": "Given the current state of negotiations, here\u2019s the situation:\n\n- Player 0 (You) have the following resources:  \n  - Wheat: 15 (Value: 5)\n  - Wood: 20 (Value: 12)\n  - Sheep: 22 (Value: 17)\n  - Brick: 9 (Value: 20)\n  - Ore: 8 (Value: 35)\n\n- Player 1 has made the latest offer:  \n  - Offered: 1 Brick  \n  - Requested: 3 Sheep\n\nSince you have a surplus of Sheep and a reasonable amount of Brick, accepting the trade may increase your resource balance positively. The valuation of Sheep and Brick suggests that this trade might not be the best for your aggregate resource value, as you would be giving up 3 Sheep (which have a value of 51) for only 1 Brick (worth 20).\n\n**Decision Making:**  \nWhile the total value of resources you have may not significantly increase with this trade, one must consider that this negotiation game is also about having tradeable assets for future offers. Thus, it's often strategic to maintain good rapport.\n\nGiven these considerations, here\u2019s how to respond:\n\n**Response:**  \n[Accept]",
