      "response": "I'll begin by analyzing my situation:\n\nCurrent Total Value:\n- Wheat: 22\u00d76 = 132 points\n- Wood: 9\u00d78 = 72 points\n- Sheep: 7\u00d717 = 119 points\n- Brick: 10\u00d725 = 250 points\n- Ore: 22\u00d738 = 836 points\n\nTotal = 1,409 points\n\nI notice I have a lot of Ore (my most valuable resource) and relatively few Wood (my least valuable). To increase my total value, I should try to trade away my lower value resources for higher value ones, or trade excess of high value resources for even better deals.\n\nSince I have 22 Ore (worth 38 each), I can afford to trade some. Wood has the worst value (8 per unit), so getting more Wood would hurt. Wheat has low value (6 per unit), so trading Wheat away seems wise. Sheep and Brick are mid-tier, but I have relatively few Sheep.\n\nStrategy: trade away Wheat and potentially some Ore for more Brick, or trade excess Wheat/Ore for better ratios.\n\nHello! I'd like to start negotiating. I'm interested in trading to improve our positions. I'm willing to trade some of my plentiful Ore or Wheat. What resources are you most looking for, and what would you be willing to offer?",

First, let's understand the current trade offer from Player 1:\n   - Player 1 wants to give: 3 Sheep (value 17 each) = 3*17 = 51 total value given\n   - Player 1 wants to receive: 5 Brick (value 25 each) = 5*25 = 125 total value received\n   - Additional: 2 Ore (value 38 each) = 76 given by Player 1? No, looking carefully Player 1 is offering 2 Ore, not receiving it.\n\nWait, let's re-express the offer:\nThe format is [Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources], with the offer coming TO Player 0.\n\nSo Player 1 is offering:\n- 3 Sheep + 2 Ore to Player 0\n- Receiving 5 Brick + 2 Sheep from Player 0\n\nIn terms of value:\n- Player 1 gives: (3*17) + (2*38) = 51 + 76 = 127 value to Player 0\n- Player 1 receives: (5*25) + (2*17) = 125 + 34 = 159 value from Player 0\n\n2. Calculate net effect:\n- Current situation:\n  - Player 0 loses: 5 Brick (125 value) + 2 Sheep (34 value) = -159\n  - Player 0 gains: 3 Sheep (51 value) + 2 Ore (76 value) = +127\n  - Net change: +127 - 159 = -32 value for Player 0\n\n3. Analysis:\n- This would be a bad trade for Player 0 as the net value decreases by 32\n- Player 0 should reject this offer\n\n4. Supply check:\nLet's also check if Player 0 has the resources:\n- Player 0 has: 10 Brick, 7 Sheep\n- Required to give: 5 Brick (ok, has 10), 2 Sheep (ok, has 7) - sufficient\n\n5.
