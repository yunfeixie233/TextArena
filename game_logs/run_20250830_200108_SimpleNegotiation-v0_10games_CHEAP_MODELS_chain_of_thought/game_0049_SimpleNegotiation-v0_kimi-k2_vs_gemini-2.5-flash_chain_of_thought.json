The marginal value of additional Brick for me is rapidly dropping, and I\u2019d love to trade some away for even slightly more valuable Ore.\n\nI believe Player 1 now has the opposite imbalance: lots of Ore and very little Brick (they just shipped me 25 Brick for only 4 Ore), so odds are good that they\u2019d accept a reverse trade.\n\nStill, given this is the 9th turn, I have only two chances left and want an offer that is fair enough that it will actually close.  I value Brick at 20 and Ore at 38.  Proposing an 2\u00d7Ore \u2245 1\u00d7Ore relative value should feel close to market (3/4) while letting me skim a little profit.\n\n[Offer: 12 Brick -> 5 Ore]",
