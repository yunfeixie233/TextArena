      "response": "To determine the best next step, let's first analyze the current situation and the resources we have.\n\nInitially, we had:\n- Wheat: 14 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 14 (Value: 9)\n- Sheep: 16 (Value: 15)\n- Brick: 5 (Value: 25)\n- Ore: 8 (Value: 35)\n\nTotal initial value = (14*5) + (14*9) + (16*15) + (5*25) + (8*35)\n                  = 70 + 126 + 240 + 125 + 280\n                  = 841\n\nAfter the last trade:\n- We offered 5 Wood to Player 0.\n- We received 2 Brick from Player 0.\n\nSo, the new quantities are:\n- Wheat: 14\n- Wood: 14 - 5 = 9\n- Sheep: 16\n- Brick: 5 + 2 = 7\n- Ore: 8\n\nNew total value = (14*5) + (9*9) + (16*15) + (7*25) + (8*35)\n                 = 70 + 81 + 240 + 175 + 280\n                 = 846\n\nThe total value of our resources has increased by 5.\n\nNow, let's consider our next move. We need to evaluate what we can offer and what we can request to further increase the total value of our resources.\n\nAvailable quantities:\n- Wheat: 14\n- Wood: 9\n- Sheep: 16\n- Brick: 7\n- Ore: 8\n\nTo increase our total value, we should aim to acquire resources with higher values or get more quantity of the same value resources if it makes strategic sense.\n\nOur highest value resources are Ore (35) and Brick (25). We already have a decent amount of Brick (7) after the last trade. Let's think about trading something for either more Ore or keeping an eye on other valuable trades.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of our less valuable resources (in terms of per unit value) for more valuable ones or for a quantity that increases our total value.\n\nFor example, offering some Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 9) for Ore (Value: 35) could be beneficial.\n\nLet's consider:\n- Offering 3 Wood (Value: 27) for 1 Ore (Value: 35). This could be a good trade as we gain 8 in value (35 - 27 = 8).\n\nThus, a potential trade offer could be: [Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 1 Ore, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Wheat] simplifies to \n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore] \n\nThe action is: [Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
