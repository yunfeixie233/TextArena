      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first calculate the total value of the resources I currently have.\n\n1. Wheat: 8 * 6 = 48\n2. Wood: 24 * 9 = 216\n3. Sheep: 18 * 12 = 216\n4. Brick: 23 * 22 = 506\n5. Ore: 23 * 40 = 920\n\nTotal value = 48 + 216 + 216 + 506 + 920 = 1906\n\nTo improve the total value, I should look for trades that increase it. Since the total value is dominated by Ore and Brick, I'll examine potential trades involving these resources.\n\n### Initial Assessment\n\n- Ore is highly valued at 40 per unit.\n- Brick is also quite valuable at 22 per unit.\n\n### Potential Trades\n\nTo increase the total value, I should consider:\n1. Trading less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n2. Ensuring that any trade does not significantly reduce my holdings of high-value resources (Ore and Brick).\n\nLet's examine possible trades:\n\n1. **Trading Wheat or Wood for Ore or Brick**: Since Wheat and Wood are less valuable than Ore and Brick, trading them could be beneficial if done at a reasonable rate.\n\n2. **Trading Sheep for Ore or Brick**: Sheep is more valuable than Wheat, Wood, and Brick but less than Ore. Trading Sheep for Ore or Brick could be beneficial.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n\nGiven the values, a potentially beneficial trade could involve offering resources like Wheat, Wood, or Sheep in exchange for Ore or Brick, if the rate is favorable.\n\nLet's start by offering a trade that could potentially increase my total value. I'll offer some of my less valuable resources for Brick or Ore.\n\n'[Offer: 10 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' \n\nThis trade offers 10 Wood (value = 90) and 2 Wheat (value = 12) for 1 Ore (value = 40). The total value offered is 102, which is more than the value received (40 for 1 Ore). This is not a good trade.\n\nLet's reconsider and make a more reasonable offer.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' \n\nThis trade offers 2 Sheep (value = 24) for 1 Ore (value = 40). The value received is greater than the value given, making it a potentially beneficial trade.\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'",

The values per unit are: Wheat = 6, Wood = 9, Sheep = 12, Brick = 22, Ore = 40.\n\n## Step 5: Identify potential trades.\nSince Ore has the highest value, we should consider acquiring more Ore or maintaining our current Ore. We could offer resources like Wheat, Wood, or Sheep for Ore or other high-value resources.\n\n## Step 6: Formulate a new trade offer.\nLet's consider offering some Wood or Sheep for Ore since we have a relatively high quantity of Wood and Sheep compared to Ore. However, we should also think about the last rejected offer and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the rejected offer and adjust the strategy.\nThe rejected offer was 5 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wood. This means Player 1 is not willing to give up 2 Sheep and 1 Wood for 5 Brick. We should consider what Player 1 might be looking for and adjust our offer.\n\n## Step 8: Consider what resources to offer and request.\nSince Ore is very valuable, let's directly offer something for Ore. We have Wood and Sheep that could be used for a trade.\n\n## Step 9: Make a new trade offer.\nLet's offer 3 Sheep for 1 Ore. The current quantity of Sheep is 18, and Ore is 24. This trade would result in: Sheep = 15, Ore = 25.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the potential gain from the new trade offer.\nCurrent Value = 1844\nAfter trade: (6 * 6) + (14 * 9) + (15 * 12) + (23 * 22) + (25 * 40)\n= 36 + 126 + 180 + 506 + 1000\n= 1848\nThe gain would be 1848 - 1844 = 4.\n\n## Step 11: Formulate the trade offer in the required format.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
