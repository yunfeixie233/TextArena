      "response": "Based on your current resources and trades completed so far, here\u2019s a summary of your updated inventory after accepting previous trade offers:\n\n- You have accepted trades from Player 1 and have gained resources but also given up some in previous trades. Let's calculate your updated resources:\n\n**Initial Inventory:**\n- Wheat: 5 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 15 (Value: 9)\n- Sheep: 10 (Value: 18)\n- Brick: 10 (Value: 27)\n- Ore: 21 (Value: 36)\n\n**Trades Accepted:**\n1. Accepted 4 Brick for 3 Ore:\n   - Wheat: 5\n   - Wood: 15\n   - Sheep: 10\n   - Brick: 6 (10 - 4)\n   - Ore: 18 (21 - 3)\n\n2. Accepted 5 Wheat and 10 Wood for 6 Ore:\n   - Wheat: 0 (5 - 5)\n   - Wood: 5 (15 - 10)\n   - Sheep: 10\n   - Brick: 6\n   - Ore: 12 (18 - 6)\n   \n3. Accepted 8 Sheep for 5 Ore:\n   - Wheat: 0\n   - Wood: 5\n   - Sheep: 2 (10 - 8)\n   - Brick: 6\n   - Ore: 7 (12 - 5)\n\n**Current Inventory After Trades:**\n- Wheat: 0\n- Wood: 5\n- Sheep: 2\n- Brick: 6\n- Ore: 7\n\nNow, you have Player 1's offer of 5 Sheep for 3 Ore. Currently, you have 2 Sheep and 7 Ore. \n\n### Decision:\nSince you don't have enough Sheep to complete the offer (you'd need 5), you should deny this offer.\n\nYour response should be:\n```\n[Deny]\n```",
