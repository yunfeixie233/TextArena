      "response": "All right, I\u2019ve read the rules and I know what I hold.  \nMy current portfolio (and its \u201cscoring\u201d values):\n\n- 5 Wheat \u2026 worth 6  \n- 15 Wood \u2026 worth 9  \n- 11 Sheep \u2026 worth 12  \n- 22 Brick \u2026 worth 24  \n- 18 Ore \u2026 worth 37  \n\nTotal value: 6 + 9 + 12 + 24 + 37 \u2245 88.\n\nObservations:\n\n1. The scoring value rises with each additional turnaround in the illustration, so I\u2019m treating these as the *marginal* (Vickrey-style) values\u2014i.e., the *unit* value of the last card increases the more of that type I own. That means I *gain* the most value by collecting yet more Ore (37 per new Ore) but lose the least by giving up Wheat (only 6 per Wheat).  \n2. Sheep and Wood are in the middle, so they\u2019re reasonable to trade away if I can be paid with higher-marginal-goods. Brick gaps are small, so losing Brick is cheap.\n\nInitial plan:  \n- I have a surfeit of Brick (22). Dumping some of it for higher-scoring goods (especially Ore) is low-risk.  \n- I have 5 Wheat\u2014the smallest stack\u2014so I\u2019m willing to trade those too.  \n- I will *not* trade away any Ore unless I\u2019m offered a net-gain package that compensates me for surrendering my highest-value resource.\n\nLet\u2019s open negotiations.\n\n[Message]  \nI'd be happy to start off with a small, easy trade to warm up.
