Given the current values:\n- The highest value resource I have is Ore (Value: 37).\n- The lowest value resources I have are Wheat (Value: 5) and Wood (Value: 8).\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some of my Wheat or Wood for resources that are more valuable. However, without knowing the opponent's resources, I'll start by making an offer that could be beneficial if they have what I need.\n\n### Proposed Trade for Turn 1\n\nI will offer some of my Wheat (Value: 5) in exchange for Brick (Value: 29) or Ore (Value: 37), as these are higher in value. Let's propose a trade that seems reasonable:\n\n- **[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]**  \n  This trade involves giving away 5 Wheat (total value of 25) for 1 Brick (value of 29), resulting in a net gain of 4.\n\nThe proposed offer in the required format is:\n```\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\n```\n\nLet's execute this trade offer for Turn 1.",

Player 1 rejected.\n   - **Turn 2**: No new offer from Player 1. Rejected the non-existent counteroffer.\n   - **Turn 3**: Offered 4 Sheep for 1 Ore.

Player 1 rejected but then made the same offer.\n   - **Turn 6**: Accepted Player 1's offer: Received 1 Ore and gave 5 Wheat, 1 Wood.\n\n4. **Resources After Last Trade**:\n   - After accepting the trade: \n     - Wheat: 17 - 5 = 12\n     - Wood: 11 - 1 = 10\n     - Sheep: 20 (unchanged)\n     - Brick: 14 (unchanged)\n     - Ore: 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5. **New Total Value**:\n   - Wheat: 12 * 5 = 60\n   - Wood: 10 * 8 = 80\n   - Sheep: 20 * 13 = 260\n   - Brick: 14 * 29 = 406\n   - Ore: 7 * 37 = 259\n   - Total Value = 60 + 80 + 260 + 406 + 259 = 1065\n\n6. **Next Steps**:\n   - We need to assess the current situation and decide on the next trade. Since we've accepted a trade that gave us more Ore, we should evaluate if we can make another beneficial trade.\n\n7. **Potential Trades**:\n   - We are looking to increase our total value. Given our current resources and the fact that Ore is very valuable, we should consider trades that either give us more high-value items or trades that are beneficial.\n\n8. **Action**:\n   - Let's analyze potential trades:\n     - Offering Sheep (Value: 13) for Ore (Value: 37) could be beneficial because Ore is more valuable.\n     - We could offer some of our less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\n### Decision:\n\nGiven the rejection of our previous offers for Ore and the acceptance of our counteroffer (which was actually Player 1's offer), a similar or slightly adjusted trade might be considered. However, since we've just gained Ore, let's think about other valuable trades.\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat or Wood (lower value items) for Brick (a relatively high-value item) or more Ore if possible.\n\n### Trade Offer for Next Turn:\n\nSince we've recently acquired Ore and our previous offers for Ore were rejected, let's try to think of a different trade. We could offer some of our Sheep for Brick, as Sheep is less valuable than Brick.\n\n- **Proposed Trade**: Offer 5 Sheep for 2 Brick.\n\nThe action in the required format: `[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]`.",
