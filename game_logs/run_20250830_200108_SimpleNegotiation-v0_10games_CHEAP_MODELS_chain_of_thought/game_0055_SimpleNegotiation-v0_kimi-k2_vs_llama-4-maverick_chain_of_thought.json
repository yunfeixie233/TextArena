Total value offered = 24 + 30 = 54.\n- Player 0 is requesting: 4 Brick (4 * 26 = 104) and 1 Sheep (1 * 16 = 16). Total value requested = 104 + 16 = 120.\n\nFor me (Player 1), accepting this offer means:\n- I give away: 4 Brick and 1 Sheep.

To simplify, I'll directly examine if there's a straightforward counteroffer.\n\nCurrent resources and values:\n- Wheat: 25, Value: 6\n- Wood: 8, Value: 10\n- Sheep: 12, Value: 16\n- Brick: 25, Value: 26\n- Ore: 21, Value: 36\n\nTo make a beneficial trade, I should look for an opportunity to exchange lower-value items for higher-value ones. One possible trade could involve offering items of lower value and requesting items of higher value.\n\nLet's directly formulate a counteroffer:\nI have Ore (Value: 36) and Brick (Value: 26), which are among the highest value. I could consider offering some of my lower-value items to get more of these or maintain my current high-value items.\n\nConsidering the initial offer is not beneficial, I will deny it and propose a counteroffer. One potential counteroffer is to offer some Wheat and Wood (lower value items) for Ore (since I already have a significant amount of Brick).\n\nA possible counteroffer: \n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]\n\nThis translates to: Offering 5 Wheat (5*6 = 30) and 2 Wood (2*10 = 20), total value = 50, for 2 Ore (2*36 = 72).\n\nLet's check the quantities:\n- I have 25 Wheat, so giving away 5 is feasible (remaining 20).\n- I have 8 Wood, so giving away 2 is feasible (remaining 6).\n- I have 21 Ore, so giving away 2 is feasible (remaining 19).\n\nThus, the action is: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
