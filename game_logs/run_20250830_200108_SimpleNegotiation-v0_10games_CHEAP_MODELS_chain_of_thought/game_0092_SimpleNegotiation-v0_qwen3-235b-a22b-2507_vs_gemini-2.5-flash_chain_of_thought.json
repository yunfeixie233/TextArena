      "response": "Lesson review: I am Player 1. I need to make a trade offer to Player 0 to increase the total value of my resources. My opponent didn't make an offer in the last turn, so I should initiate.\n\nMy current resources and their values are:\n*   Wheat: 21 (Value: 5)\n*   Wood: 16 (Value: 9)\n*   Sheep: 22 (Value: 17)\n*   Brick: 9 (Value: 24)\n*   Ore: 10 (Value: 36)\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value. I want to trade away resources with lower value for resources with higher value.\n\nLet's look at the value hierarchy: Wheat (5) < Wood (9) < Sheep (17) < Brick (24) < Ore (36).\n\nI have a lot of Wheat and Sheep, which are relatively low in value. I also have some Brick and Ore, which are high value. I should aim to get more Brick or Ore.\n\nI could offer Wheat or Sheep for Brick or Ore.\n\nConsider trading away Sheep for Brick.\nValue of 1 Sheep = 17\nValue of 1 Brick = 24\nSo trading 1 Sheep for 1 Brick is not a good deal for me. I need to offer more Sheep for 1 Brick.\n17 x 2 = 34. So 2 Sheep (34 value) for 1 Brick (24 value) is a loss for me.\nThe ratio should be favorable to me.\n\nPerhaps I should offer a combination of lower-value resources for a higher-value resource.\n\nLet's try to get Ore (36). Brick (24) is also good.\n\nOption 1: Trade Wheat for higher value resources.\n5 Wheat (Value 25) for 1 Brick (Value 24) - I lose 1 value this way.\n7 Wheat (Value 35) for 1 Brick (Value 24) - I lose 11 value.\nThis is difficult without a large quantity of a single resource.\n\nOption 2: Trade Sheep for higher value resources.\n1 Sheep (17) + 1 Wood (9) = 26 (can get 1 Brick, value 24, still a slight loss for me)\n\nWhat if I aim for a quantity of a higher value item?\nI have 22 Sheep (value 17 each).\nI have 10 Ore (value 36 each).\n\nMaybe I can offer some lower value resources to get more of the highest value resource, Ore.\nSuppose I want to get 1 Ore (value 36).\nI could offer:\n*   2 Sheep (value 34) - not enough.\n*   1 Sheep (17) + 1 Brick (24)? No, I don't trade away Brick for Ore unless I get significantly more ore.\n\nLet's try to trade Sheep and Wood for Brick or Ore.\nIf I give up:\n* 3 Sheep (3 * 17 = 51)\n* 1 Wood (1 * 9 = 9)\nTotal value offered: 60\n\nWhat can I request?\n* 2 Brick (2 * 24 = 48) - I gain 60-48 = 12 value. This is a good trade for me!\n* 1 Ore (36) + 1 Sheep (17) = 53. I gain 7 value.\n* 1 Ore (36) + 1 Wood (9) = 45. I gain 15 value. This is even better!\n\nLet's propose: [Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood].\nMy offered value: 3 Sheep (51) + 1 Wood (9) = 60.\nRequested value: 1 Ore (36) + 1 Wood (9) = 45.\nThis means I lose 15 value. Not good for me. I made a mistake in the calculation *in my head*.\nI should be giving less value to get more value.\n\nLet's rethink. I want the Requested Value to be higher than Offered Value.\n\nMy current resources are:\nWheat: 21 (Value: 5)\nWood: 16 (Value: 9)\nSheep: 22 (Value: 17)\nBrick: 9 (Value: 24)\nOre: 10 (Value: 36)\n\nOffer 1: Trade a lower value for a higher value directly.\nOffer: 2 Sheep (34 value)\nRequest: 1 Brick (24 value). I lose 10 value. Bad deal.\n\nOffer: 3 Sheep (51 value)\nRequest: 1 Brick (24 value) + 1 Wood (9 value) = 33 value. I lose 18 value. Bad deal.\n\nI need to offer less value than I receive.\n\nWhat if I offer a lot of Wheat or Wood for some higher-value item?\n\nPossibility 1: Offer Wheat.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat (25 value) -> 1 Brick (24 value)]. I lose 1 value this way. Not ideal.\n[Offer: 6 Wheat (30 value) -> 1 Brick (24 value)]. I lose 6 value. Not ideal.\n\nPossibility 2: Offer Wood.\n[Offer: 2 Wood (18 value) -> 1 Sheep (17 value)]. I lose 1 value. Not ideal.\n\nPossibility 3: Offer Sheep.\n[Offer: 1 Sheep (17 value) -> 1 Wood (9 value)]. I lose 8 value. Bad.\n\nThis implies I need to offer multiple low-value items for one high-value item, where the total value I give up is less than the value I get.\n\nLet's aim for Brick (24) or Ore (36).\n\nScenario: Get 1 Brick (24 value).\nWhat can I give to get 24 value, but give up less than 24?\n*   5 Wheat (25 value) - lose 1\n*   2 Wood (18) + 1 Wheat (5) = 23. Offer this for 1 Brick!\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nOffered Value: (2 * 9) + (1 * 5) = 18 + 5 = 23.\nRequested Value: 1 * 24 = 24.\nNet gain for me: 24 - 23 = 1. This is a small gain, but a gain nonetheless.\nThis respects the value hierarchy. I give up two low-value resources for one higher-value resource.\nI have plenty of Wood (16) and Wheat (21).\nThis looks like a good first offer.\n\nLet's confirm the quantities are available.\nI have: 21 Wheat, 16 Wood. So, yes, I can offer 2 Wood and 1 Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
