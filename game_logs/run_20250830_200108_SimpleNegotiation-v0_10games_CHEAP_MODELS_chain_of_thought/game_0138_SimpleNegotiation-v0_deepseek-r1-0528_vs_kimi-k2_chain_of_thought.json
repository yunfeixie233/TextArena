      "response": "After reviewing Player 1's offer of 4 Ore for 8 Wood, I accept this trade. Giving up 8 Wood (valued at 12 per unit) results in a loss of 96 total value, but receiving 4 Ore (valued at 40 per unit) gains 160 value, netting a +64 increase to my total resources value. This aligns with my goal of maximizing value, and I have sufficient Wood to support this trade.\n\n[Accept]",
