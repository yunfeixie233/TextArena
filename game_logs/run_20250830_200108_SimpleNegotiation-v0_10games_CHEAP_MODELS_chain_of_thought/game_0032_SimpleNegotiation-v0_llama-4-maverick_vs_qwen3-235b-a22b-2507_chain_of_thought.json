      "response": "### Negotiation Game Strategy\n\nTo maximize the total value of my resources, I will analyze the current resources and their values, and then decide on a trade strategy.\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n- Wheat: 25 units, Value: 6 per unit\n- Wood: 10 units, Value: 9 per unit\n- Sheep: 6 units, Value: 14 per unit\n- Brick: 23 units, Value: 24 per unit\n- Ore: 25 units, Value: 40 per unit\n\n#### Initial Total Value:\nTo understand the starting point, let's calculate the total initial value:\n- Wheat: 25 * 6 = 150\n- Wood: 10 * 9 = 90\n- Sheep: 6 * 14 = 84\n- Brick: 23 * 24 = 552\n- Ore: 25 * 40 = 1000\n- Total Value = 150 + 90 + 84 + 552 + 1000 = 1876\n\n#### Strategy:\n1. **Identify Valuable Resources:** Ore is the most valuable resource per unit, followed by Brick. I have a significant amount of both, so I should try to keep or acquire more of these if possible.\n\n2. **Identify Less Valuable Resources:** Wheat and Wood are less valuable per unit compared to the others. I can consider trading some of these for more valuable resources or keeping them if there's a potential for a good trade.\n\n3. **First Turn Action:**\nSince I have a good amount of Brick and Ore, which are high-value resources, and a considerable amount of Wheat, which is less valuable, I can consider offering some Wheat or Wood for additional Sheep or more Brick/Ore if possible.\n\nLet's make an offer that could potentially increase my total value. I have 25 Wheat, which is not very valuable. Offering some Wheat for a resource that could be more valuable or equally valuable could be a good start.\n\n#### Trade Offer for Turn 1:\nI will offer 5 Wheat for 1 Sheep because Sheep is more valuable than Wheat, and acquiring more Sheep could be beneficial.\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response. \n\nSince I made an offer, my action for Turn 1 is:\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`",

The trade was not favorable in terms of value, which might be why it was rejected.\n\n2. **Potential Trades for This Turn:**\n   - Consider what we have and what could be valuable to trade. Since our offer was rejected, we should think about making a more balanced or beneficial trade.\n   - One strategy is to look for trades where we give away resources of lower value and gain resources of higher value.\n\n3. **New Offer:**\n   - Let's consider trading some Wheat (Value: 6) or Wood (Value: 9) for Sheep (Value: 14) or Brick (Value: 24), as these are relatively more valuable.\n   - An example could be trading some of our Wheat or Wood for Sheep, as Sheep is more valuable than Wheat and could potentially be a more appealing trade.\n\n#### Proposed Action for This Turn:\nLet's make a new offer that gives away 4 Wood (Value: 4*9 = 36) for 2 Sheep (Value: 2*14 = 28). Although this isn't a value-increasing trade directly, having more Sheep could be strategic. However, upon closer inspection, this trade isn't ideal due to the value imbalance.\n\nUpon further consideration, a potentially more strategic trade could be:\n- `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n- Offered: 3 Wheat (3*6 = 18) + 2 Wood (2*9 = 18) = 36\n- Requested: 1 Brick (1*24 = 24)\n\nThis trade still isn't ideal. Let's simplify and adjust:\n- `[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nValue calculation:\n- Offered: 2 Wheat (2*6 = 12)\n- Requested: 1 Sheep (1*14 = 14)\n\nThis is a more straightforward and potentially more acceptable trade as it offers a gain in value.\n\n### Action:\n`[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nThis trade aims to be more balanced and potentially more appealing to Player 1, while also being beneficial or at least not significantly detrimental to us.",

Player 1 offered: 3 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 10 Wheat, 5 Ore\n\n### Analysis of Player 1's Offer:\n- Player 1 is offering: 3 Sheep (Value: 3*14 = 42), 1 Wood (Value: 9) in exchange for 10 Wheat (Value: 10*6 = 60), 5 Ore (Value: 5*40 = 200).\n- Total value offered by Player 1: 42 + 9 = 51\n- Total value requested by Player 1: 60 + 200 = 260\n- Net gain for Player 0 if accepted: (Value received) - (Value given) = 51 - 260 = -209\n\n### Decision:\nThe offer from Player 1 is not favorable to Player 0 as it results in a significant net loss of value (-209). \n\n### Calculating an Alternative:\nLet's directly evaluate the offer made by Player 1.\n\n### Response:\nGiven that the offer from Player 1 is not beneficial, the best course of action is to deny the offer.\n\n### Action:\n'[Deny]'\n\nThis response adheres to the required format and rejects the unfavorable trade offer made by Player 1. \n\nThe current turn is the 4th turn out of 10. We can think of making a new offer or waiting for Player 1 to make another one. Let's think about a potential new offer.\n\n### New Offer Consideration:\nWe need to think of a trade that could be mutually beneficial or at least not very disadvantageous. One strategy is to try and get more of the higher-value items or maintain our current value while getting something we need or want.\n\nLet's consider offering something we have in abundance for something of higher value. For example, we could think about trading some Wheat or Ore for Sheep or Brick since they are relatively more valuable.\n\n### Example New Offer:\nConsidering the values, let's think about offering: '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]' or a variation that might be more appealing.\n\nHowever, since Player 1 has already rejected similar offers, we should consider a different combination that might be more appealing.\n\nLet's directly formulate a response.\n\n### New Action:\n'[Offer: 8 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Sheep]' \n\nThis is just an example; the actual numbers can be adjusted based on further analysis or intuition about what Player 1 might accept.\n\nLet's go with the deny action for now and think about making a new offer in the next step.\n\n### Actual Action for This Turn:\n'[Deny]'",

      "response": "## Step 1: Evaluate the current resources and their values.\nThe current resources and their values are: Wheat (Qty: 25, Value: 6) = 150, Wood (Qty: 10, Value: 9) = 90, Sheep (Qty: 6, Value: 14) = 84, Brick (Qty: 23, Value: 24) = 552, Ore (Qty: 25, Value: 40) = 1000. The total value is 150 + 90 + 84 + 552 + 1000 = 1876.\n\n## Step 2: Assess the previous trade offers and their outcomes.\nThe previous offers made by Player 0 to Player 1 were: 5 Wheat for 1 Sheep (rejected multiple times), and 10 Wheat, 1 Wood for 2 Sheep (rejected). Player 1 made two offers: 3 Sheep, 1 Wood for 10 Wheat, 5 Ore (rejected by Player 0), and 10 Wheat, 2 Wood for 3 Sheep, 1 Brick.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Player 1's last offer.\nPlayer 1's last offer was: 10 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Sheep, 1 Brick. Let's calculate the value of this offer. Player 0 gives away 10 Wheat (10*6 = 60) and 2 Wood (2*9 = 18), totaling 78. Player 0 receives 3 Sheep (3*14 = 42) and 1 Brick (1*24 = 24), totaling 66. This offer results in a loss of 12 value for Player 0.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if Player 0 should accept or reject Player 1's last offer.\nSince the offer results in a loss of value for Player 0, it should be rejected.\n\n## Step 5: Consider making a new offer.\nPlayer 0 has been offering 5 Wheat for 1 Sheep, which has been rejected multiple times. Let's consider an alternative. We could offer something more valuable or try to negotiate a different ratio. Another option is to directly propose a trade that could be beneficial, like offering resources that are less valuable to us but potentially valuable to Player 1.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate potential trades based on current resources and values.\nLet's examine potential trades. One potential trade could involve Ore since it's highly valued. For example, offering Ore for Sheep or Brick could be beneficial if the ratio is right.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a new trade offer.\nConsidering the values, let's formulate a new offer. If we offer 2 Ore (2*40 = 80) for 3 Sheep (3*14 = 42), it might not be favorable. However, offering 1 Ore (1*40 = 40) for 1 Sheep (1*14 = 14) and some other resource could work. Let's directly consider a trade that involves our less valued resources for more valued ones.\n\n## Step 8: Propose a trade offer.\nLet's offer: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]. This has been rejected before, but let's try a variation. How about [Offer: 10 Wheat, 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep]? The value given is 10*6 + 1*24 = 60 + 24 = 84, and the value received is 3*14 = 42. This is not a good trade. Let's think about what's valuable to us and what we can offer.\n\n## Step 9: Reconsider the offer made by Player 1 and adjust our strategy.\nSince our previous offers were rejected and Player 1's offer was not beneficial, let's think about our goal. We need to increase our total value. Let's directly analyze the last offer from Player 1: 10 Wheat, 2 Wood for 3 Sheep, 1 Brick. We can try to negotiate or come up with a counteroffer.\n\n## Step 10: Decide on the next action.\nLet's make a counteroffer to Player 1's last proposal. Instead of accepting or directly rejecting, we can modify the offer. For instance, [Offer: 8 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep, 1 Brick]. Here, we give away less Wheat and Wood compared to Player 1's offer but also receive less Sheep.\n\nThe final answer is [Offer: 8 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep, 1 Brick].",
