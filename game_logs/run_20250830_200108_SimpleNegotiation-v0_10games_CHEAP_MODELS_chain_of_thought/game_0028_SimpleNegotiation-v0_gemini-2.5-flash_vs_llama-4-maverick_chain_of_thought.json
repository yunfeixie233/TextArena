For instance, Brick is quite valuable (Value: 30), so offering 1 Brick could be a good start because it's close to the value of 1 Ore.\n\nSo, a potential counteroffer could be: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore\n\nThis is a more balanced trade in terms of value (30 for Brick vs. 34 for Ore), but still slightly in favor of Player 0.\n\nLet's propose this counteroffer:\n'[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis action is to be taken in response to Player 0's initial offer. \n\nTherefore, my response is: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",

To do this, we need to identify which resources are valuable and try to acquire more of them or maintain the current composition if it's already optimal.\n\n1. **Current Total Value Calculation:**\n   - Wheat: 14 * 5 = 70\n   - Wood: 20 * 10 = 200\n   - Sheep: 10 * 12 = 120\n   - Brick: 9 * 30 = 270\n   - Ore: 15 * 34 = 510\n   - Total Value = 70 + 200 + 120 + 270 + 510 = 1170\n\n2. **Analysis of Previous Offers and Counteroffers:**\n   - Player 0 offered 3 Wheat for 1 Ore. This was rejected. The value given away would be 3*5 = 15, and the value received would be 1*34 = 34. So, accepting would increase the total value.\n   - Player 1 counteroffered 1 Brick for 1 Ore. The value given away is 1*30 = 30, and the value received is 1*34 = 34. This is a positive trade.\n   - Subsequent offers and counteroffers were made but rejected by both parties.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   Given that Ore has the highest value, and we already have a significant amount of it, we should be cautious about trading it away. However, we can consider trades that either acquire more Ore or other high-value resources if possible.\n\n4. **Potential Trades:**\n   - Acquiring Brick (Value: 30) could be beneficial if we can get it for a resource with a lower value. However, our current Brick quantity is relatively low compared to other resources.\n   - We should consider making an offer that either retains or increases our current high-value resources.\n\n5. **Next Action:**\n   Since Player 0 didn't make a new offer, we need to decide on our next move.\n\nLet's consider making an offer that could be beneficial:\n- We have plenty of Wheat (low value) and could offer some for a higher value resource, but previous attempts to trade Wheat for Brick or Ore were not successful.\n- We could offer some Sheep (Value: 12) for Ore (Value: 34), as this could be a more appealing trade.\n\nLet's make an offer: \n- Offered items: 2 Sheep (2*12 = 24) -> Requested items: 1 Ore (1*34 = 34). This trade increases our total value.\n\nThe action is: `[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`.",
