This suggests Player 1 may not value Sheep highly or wants better ratios.\n- Player 1's offers have been 2 Wood for 1 Ore or 1 Wood for 1 Ore. These are poor trades for me (since Ore is much more valuable than Wood), so I rightly rejected them.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nSince Player 1 isn't interested in Sheep/Wood trades at the rates I offered, and their offers undervalued my Ore, I need to adjust my approach. Perhaps offering **Brick** (which I have plenty of) for **Wood** (which I have little of) would be more appealing, as Brick is reasonably valuable but I have excess.\n\n**New Offer to Player 1:**\nI can afford to give away Brick since I have 19 units, and gaining Wood would directly increase the total value of my holdings (as I have little Wood). \n\nI'll offer: 2 Brick (value per unit 1.26, so total offered value = 2 * 1.26 = 2.52) for 1 Wood (value per unit 1.33, so total requested value = 1 * 1.33 = 1.33).
