I will then make a counter offer that I believe is more equitable and beneficial to me.\n\nNegotiation Strategy: I want to increase the total value of my resources. This means I should aim to trade items with lower value for items with higher value, or trade items I have in abundance (lower individual value) for items with higher scarcity and individual value.\n\nConsider my resources and their values:\nWheat: 6 (lowest value)\nWood: 11\nSheep: 14\nBrick: 20\nOre: 37 (highest value)\n\nI have a good quantity of Wheat, Wood, Sheep, and Brick. My Ore quantity is low. I want to acquire more Ore or Brick if possible, or trade my lower value items for higher value ones.\n\nLet's look at Player 0's offer again: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Sheep, 1 Brick.\nPlayer 0 is looking for Sheep and Brick. I have 12 Sheep and 14 Brick.\n\nMy counter-offer: I will offer some Wheat and Wood (lower value) for Sheep and/or Brick, but in a way that benefits me.\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of Wheat and Wood for a smaller amount of Brick?\n\nLet's try to get Brick for Wheat/Wood.\nHow about: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Brick\nMy offer value: (10 * 6) + (5 * 11) = 60 + 55 = 115\nTheir receive value: (3 * 20) = 60\nThis is too much in my favor / unlikely to be accepted.\n\nLet's aim for a more balanced offer so they might accept. I want profit, but not so much that they deny immediately.\n\nHow about trading items I have a lot of for a more valuable item?\nI have 22 Wheat (Value 6) and 22 Wood (Value 11).\n\nConsider a trade that lets me reduce my lower value items and get some higher value ones.\nI could offer a mix of Wheat and Wood for some Brick.\n\nLet's propose: 10 Wheat, 4 Wood (Value: 60 + 44 = 104) for 4 Brick (Value: 4 * 20 = 80).\nStill not in my favor if they accept it, I want more value.\n\nI want to give away items of lower total value, and receive items of higher total value.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Wood. Player 0 offered Wheat and Wood, asking for Sheep and Brick. This implies they might value Sheep and Brick.\n\nLet's try to get Ore if possible, as it's my highest value resource.\nIf I offer 10 Wheat (Value 60) and 5 Wood (Value 55) = 115. Can I get 3 Ore (Value 3*37 = 111)? Net gain of 4. This is a possibility.\n\nHowever, Player 0's initial offer didn't involve Ore, so they might not have it or not want to trade it.\nLet's focus on Sheep, Brick, or even negotiating with Wheat and Wood.\n\nWhat if I counter their initial request for Sheep and Brick, but make it more advantageous for me?\nTheir offer: Give 5 Wheat, 2 Wood (Value 52) -> My 3 Sheep, 1 Brick (Value 62). Denied.\n\nMy counter: Offer them an item of value that they asked for (Sheep/Brick) but demand more in return.\nOr, offer my low-value items for their high-value items.\n\nLet's try to get more Sheep/Brick.\nMy current Sheep: 12 (Value 14) -> total 168\nMy current Brick: 14 (Value 20) -> total 280\n\nHow about I offer a substantial amount of Wheat and Wood for some Sheep and Brick, but such that I profit?\nExample:\nOffer: 12 Wheat, 5 Wood = (12*6) + (5*11) = 72 + 55 = 127\nRequest: 6 Sheep, 2 Brick = (6*14) + (2*20) = 84 + 40 = 124\nThis is a small loss for me, so no.\n\nI must *gain* value.\nLet's try to get 1 Brick, for a bunch of Wheat and Wood.\n1 Brick = 20.\nHow about 2 Wood, 1 Wheat for 1 Brick?\nMy offer: 2 Wood (22) + 1 Wheat (6) = 28\nTheir gain: 1 Brick (20)\nI gain 8 value. This is a good trade for me, but maybe too much in my favor.\n\nLet's reconsider Player 0's offer to gauge their value perception:\nPlayer 0 offered: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood (Total Value 52)\nPlayer 0 requested: 3 Sheep, 1 Brick (Total Value 62)\nPlayer 0 thinks 3 Sheep, 1 Brick is worth more than 5 Wheat, 2 Wood. Or they want Sheep and Brick more, and value their Wheat/Wood less.\n\nGiven this, I should aim to trade my Wheat/Wood for their Sheep/Brick, but at a profit for myself.\n\nLet's propose:\nI offer: 8 Wheat, 4 Wood\nValue: (8 * 6) + (4 * 11) = 48 + 44 = 92\nI request: 4 Sheep, 2 Brick\nValue: (4 * 14) + (2 * 20) = 56 + 40 = 96\nThis is a small gain of 4 for me. This seems plausible and beneficial.\nI have plenty of Wheat and Wood to spare. I'm gaining low-cost Sheep and medium-cost Brick for my lowest cost resources.\n\nLet's refine. What if I aim for more Brick? Brick value is higher.\nHow about:\nOffer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood\nValue: (10 * 6) + (5 * 11) = 60 + 55 = 115\nRequest: 5 Sheep, 3 Brick\nValue: (5 * 14) + (3 * 20) = 70 + 60 = 130\nThis would be a gain of 15 for me. Still seems fair enough to be accepted. I have enough of these resources.\n\nI will decline their offer and make this counter-offer.\n\nPlayer 1 action: Deny\nPlayer 1 action: [Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 5 Sheep, 3 Brick]",

      "response": "The opponent has made a good offer.\nTo calculate its value to me, I first have to calculate the total value of the items I would give away.\n12 Wheat = 12 * 6 = 72\n6 Wood = 6 * 11 = 66\nTotal value of resources given away = 72 + 66 = 138\n\nThen, I will calculate the value of the resources I would gain:\n4 Sheep = 4 * 14 = 56\n2 Ore = 2 * 37 = 74\nTotal value of resources gained = 56 + 74 = 130\n\nIn this potential trade, I would lose 138 in value but gain only 130 -- a net loss of 8. Therefore, I will reject this offer.\n\nNext, I need to make a new offer that is more beneficial to me. I've been trying to get more Sheep and Brick for my Wheat and Wood. The previous offers were too expensive for my opponent. I will try to offer 10 Wheat and 5 Wood for 4 Sheep and 2 Brick. This way, the opponent will have better reason to accept.\n\nValue of my offered items:\n10 Wheat = 10 * 6 = 60\n5 Wood = 5 * 11 = 55\nTotal value of resources to be given away = 60 + 55 = 115\n\nValue of requested items:\n4 Sheep = 4 * 14 = 56\n2 Brick = 2 * 20 = 40\nTotal value of resources to be gained = 56 + 40 = 96\n\nNet value = 96 - 115 = -19. This creates too much of a loss for me. So I'll adjust the offer.\n\nI'll try another offer. I'll offer what I have the most of, Wheat and Wood, to gain Sheep and Brick, which have higher individual values.\nI'll offer 15 Wheat and 5 Wood to get 5 Sheep and 2 Brick.\n\nValue of my offered items:\n15 Wheat = 15 * 6 = 90\n5 Wood = 5 * 11 = 55\nTotal value of resources to be given away = 90 + 55 = 145\n\nValue of requested items:\n5 Sheep = 5 * 14 = 70\n2 Brick = 2 * 20 = 40\nTotal value of resources to be gained = 70 + 40 = 110\n\nNet value = 110 - 145 = -35. Still too much of a loss.\n\nI'll try to refine the previous offer where the opponent offered 4 Sheep, 2 Ore for my 12 Wheat and 6 Wood. This was close given the net loss was only 8. What If I offered the same items I was offering before (12 Wheat, 6 Wood) but I asked for 4 Sheep and 3 Ore?\n\nValue of my offered items:\n12 Wheat = 12 * 6 = 72\n6 Wood = 6 * 11 = 66\nTotal value of resources to be given away = 72 + 66 = 138\n\nValue of requested items:\n4 Sheep = 4 * 14 = 56\n3 Ore = 3 * 37 = 111\nTotal value of resources to be gained = 56 + 111 = 167\n\nNet value = 167 - 138 = 29.This creates a net gain for me of 29 units, making it a good offer from my perspective. Let's see if the opponent accepts.\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 12 Wheat, 6 Wood -> 4 Sheep, 3 Ore]",
