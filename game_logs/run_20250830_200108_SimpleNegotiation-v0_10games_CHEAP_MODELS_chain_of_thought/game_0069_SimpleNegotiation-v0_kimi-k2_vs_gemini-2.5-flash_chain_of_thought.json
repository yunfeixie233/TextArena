These are high-value resources (29 and 37), so trading them away should net high returns.\n2. **Sheep is lowest quantity (7)** and has moderate value (16). Could trade some for stuff you lack.\n3. **Wheat (6) and Wood (13)** are lower-value resources. Could bundle these with higher-value ones for a better deal.\n\n### Potential Next Offer:\nSince Player 1 hasn\u2019t made any offers yet, I should make another trade to leverage my surplus Brick and Ore. A good move is to trade away **Brick** (29 value) for **Wheat/Wood** (which have lower value 5/12) in a favorable ratio.\n\n**Example Offer:**\n- Offer: 4 Brick (29 value each) \u2192 5 Wheat (5 value each) and 5 Wood (12 value each)  \n  - Value Given: 4 * 29 = 116  \n  - Value Received: 5 * 5 + 5 * 12 = 25 + 60 = 85  \n  - Net Loss: -31 (I\u2019d lose value\u2014bad idea)\n\nReworking:  \nI need to request **more high-value resources**. Instead:  \n- Offer: 3 Brick (87 value) \u2192 5 Sheep (80 value)  \n  - Net: -7 (still bad)  \n\nBetter to request **Ore**, but I already have 14. Instead, let\u2019s give **Ore** for more **Sheep/Wood**.\n\nRevised:  \n- Offer: 3 Ore (111 value) \u2192 5 Sheep (80 value)  \n  - Net: -31 (bad)  \n\nHmm, maybe give **lower-value resources (Wood/Wheat)** for **Sheep/Ore**.\n\n**Better Offer** (bundling):  \n- Offer: 4 Wood (48 value), 2 Wheat (10 value) \u2192 3 Sheep (48 value)  \n  - Net: (48+10=58) vs (48) \u2192 -10 (still bad)  \n\nThis suggests I should **demand more for Brick/Ore**. Let\u2019s try:  \n- Offer: 3 Brick (87 value) \u2192 5 Wheat (25) + 5 Wood (60)  \n  - Net: 87 vs 85 = -2 (close, but not great)  \n\nRealization: **Sheep has best trade value** (16 per unit). Let\u2019s trade Sheep for higher quantities of Wheat/Wood.  \n\n**Final Offer:**  \n[Offer: 2 Sheep (32 value) -> 5 Wheat (25 value) and 3 Wood (36 value)]  \n- Net: 32 vs 61 = +29 (good!)  \n\nWait, this favors me heavily. Will Player 1 accept? Likely no. Scale back.  \n\nRe-adjust:  \n[Offer: 2 Sheep (32) -> 3 Wheat (15) and 3 Wood (36)]  \nNet: 32 vs 51 = +19 (still good for me)  \n\nThis seems fair enough.  \n\n  \n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 4 Wood, 1 Brick]",
