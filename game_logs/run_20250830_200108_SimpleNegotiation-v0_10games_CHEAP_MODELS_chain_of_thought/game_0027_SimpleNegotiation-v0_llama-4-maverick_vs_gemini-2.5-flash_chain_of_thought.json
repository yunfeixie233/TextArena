      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the current state of resources and the game history.\nThe player currently has: 21 Wheat (Value: 5), 13 Wood (Value: 11), 21 Sheep (Value: 13), 6 Brick (Value: 20), 9 Ore (Value: 34). The game has just started, and there have been two rounds of trade offers. The first offer was 4 Wheat for 1 Brick, which was rejected. The second offer was 4 Sheep for 1 Ore, also rejected.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the rejected offers to understand what might be acceptable to Player 1.\nThe first rejected offer was 4 Wheat (Value: 5 * 4 = 20) for 1 Brick (Value: 20). This suggests that Player 1 might not be looking to acquire Wheat at the current terms or values the Brick more than or equal to the Wheat offered. The second rejected offer was 4 Sheep (Value: 13 * 4 = 52) for 1 Ore (Value: 34), indicating Player 1 likely values Ore more than Sheep since they rejected an offer that would have given them a significant gain in value.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the current resources and values to determine the best course of action.\nGiven the resources and their values, the player should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. The values are: Wheat (5), Wood (11), Sheep (13), Brick (20), Ore (34). The player has a surplus of Wheat and Sheep relative to their value and a relatively lower quantity of Brick and Ore, which are higher in value.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a new trade offer based on the analysis.\nSince the last offer (4 Sheep for 1 Ore) was rejected, and considering that Ore is very valuable, it might be worth making a more substantial offer for Ore or considering other resources. However, given that Ore is highly valued and the previous offer was rejected, it might be worth checking if Player 1 has made any offer or if there's another resource that could be traded for Ore or other high-value resources.\n\n## Step 5: Consider an alternative trade that could be beneficial.\nBefore making another offer, it's essential to consider what Player 1 might be looking for. Since there's no new offer from Player 1, we need to think about what they might want based on the offers made. They rejected Wheat for Brick and Sheep for Ore. Perhaps they have resources that could be traded for something they need.\n\n## Step 6: Decide on the next action.\nGiven that the last offer was rejected and there's been no counteroffer, the next step is to make a new offer. Considering the high value of Ore and the rejection of 4 Sheep for 1 Ore, a potential next offer could involve more resources or a different combination that still aims to acquire high-value resources.\n\n## Step 7: Propose a new trade offer.\nLet's consider offering resources for Brick or Ore since they are high-value. A possible offer could be: Offering 3 Wheat and 1 Wood (total value = 3*5 + 1*11 = 26) for 1 Ore (Value: 34). This offer is [Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore].\n\n## Step 8: Format the proposed trade offer according to the game's format.\nThe proposed offer in the required format is: [Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore].\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]}$",
