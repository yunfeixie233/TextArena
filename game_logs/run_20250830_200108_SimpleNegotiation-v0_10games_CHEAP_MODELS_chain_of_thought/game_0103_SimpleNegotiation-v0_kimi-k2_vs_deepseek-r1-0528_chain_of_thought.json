After the first accepted offer (5 Wheat + 2 Wood  \u2794  2 Sheep)\n   I gave: 5 Wheat (5\u00d76 = 30 value) + 2 Wood (2\u00d78 = 16 value)  \u2192 46 value out\n   I got: 2 Sheep (2\u00d715 = 30 value)  \u2192 30 value in  \n   Net change: 30 \u2013 46 = \u201316.\n\n2. After the second accepted offer (2 Ore \u2794 1 Sheep)\n   I gave: 2 Ore (2\u00d733 = 66 value) out  \n   I got: 1 Sheep (15 value) in  \n   Net change: 15 \u2013 66 = \u201351.\n\n3. After the third accepted offer (3 Wood + 2 Ore \u2794 2 Sheep)\n   I gave: 3 Wood (3\u00d78 = 24) + 2 Ore (2\u00d733 = 66)  \u2192 90 value out\n   I got: 2 Sheep (30 value) in  \n   Net change: 30 \u2013 90 = \u201360.\n\nOverall after the first three trades I\u2019m down 16 + 51 + 60 = 127 points worth of material while earning only 75 points\u2014so I\u2019ve lost 52 total value so far.  \nThe single most valuable resource for both of us is Ore (33 per unit).  I currently have:\n\n21 initial \u2013 2 \u2013 2 = 17 Ore left.\n\nThe only reasonable counter-offer Player 1 has floated is \u201c1 Sheep for 3 Ore\u201d.  \nEven at face value that would lose me 3\u00d733 \u2013 15 = 84 points, so I certainly won\u2019t accept that, and I see no point in altering it slightly.  Therefore:\n\n[Deny]\n\nI will instead try to swing the next deal back in my favor: I\u2019ll offer 3 of my plentiful Brick (26 value each) for 2 Ore (33 each), a 78 \u2194 66 swap that tempts my opponent while giving me more of the best resource.\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]",
