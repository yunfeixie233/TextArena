      "observation": "\n[GAME] You are Player 0 in Tic Tac Toe.\nYour goal is to win three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the board.\nOn your turn, you should select the square number (0-8) you want to put your mark in next.\nFor example, '[4]' places your mark in the center cell of the board.\n\nAs Player 0, you will be 'O', while your opponent is 'X'.\n\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To start the game, I'll place my 'O' in the center of the board to control the center and allow for the greatest flexibility for my next move. The center square is numbered 4.\n\nMy move: [4]\n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves after my move: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] As Player 1 ('X'), I'll respond to your move by placing my mark in a corner square. The corner positions are strong because they offer more opportunities to create winning lines, such as diagonals, rows, or columns. Since you've taken the center (4), I'll start by claiming the top-left corner (square 0) to build my position and potentially force you to defend.\n\nMy move: [0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To continue the game, I'll analyze the current state of the board and decide on the next move.\n\nCurrent Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n\nSince Player 1 ('X') has placed their mark in the top-left corner (0), I'll consider a strategic response. My 'O' is in the center (4), so I'll look for a move that will allow me to potentially create a winning line while also responding to the 'X' in the corner.\n\nA good strategy is to place my next 'O' in a position that will give me two possible ways to win or create a strong potential for a win. \n\nI'll place my next 'O' in position [8] because it is a corner and provides a good opportunity to create a potential diagonal or prepare for a future row or column win.\n\nMy move: [8]\n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves after my move: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] As Player 1 ('X'), I'll analyze the current board and decide on my next move. The board is:\n\nCurrent Board:\n\n X | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n\nWith my 'X' in the top-left corner (position 0), and 'O' in the top-middle (position 1) and center (position 4), I need to prioritize creating opportunities for myself while blocking potential threats from 'O'. 'O' could build toward winning in the middle row (positions 3, 4, 5) or other lines, so I should aim for a strong position like a corner to set up a fork or force a defense.\n\nI'll place my 'X' in position [8], a corner that opposes my existing mark and threatens the main diagonal (positions 0, 4, 8). This move pressures 'O' and maintains my advantage.\n\nMy move: [8]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] It appears there has been a mistake in the last move description. According to the move made by Player 1, the correct board state should reflect 'X' being placed in position [2], not [8]. Let's correct that and continue.\n\nThe correct Current Board after Player 1's move should be:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n\nAs Player 0 ('O'), I'll analyze this state and make my next move. Given that 'X' is now in the top-right corner (2), and my 'O' is in the center (4) and top-middle (1), I need to decide on a strategic response.\n\nTo counter 'X' in the top-right, I'll focus on strengthening my position and creating potential winning lines. I'll place my next 'O' in position [3], aiming to potentially create a winning line in the middle row (positions 3, 4, 5) or prepare for other future opportunities.\n\nMy move: [3]\n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves after my move: '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[GAME] Player 0 attempted an invalid move.

The board shows 'O' with two in a row in the middle row (positions 3 and 4) and two in the middle column (positions 1 and 4), so 'O' could win by taking position 5 or 7. To prevent an immediate loss, I must block the middle row by placing my 'X' in position 5.\n\nMy move: [5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] The current state of the board is:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n6 |7 |8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n\nAs Player0 ('O'), I've analyzed the current state and will make my next move. With 'X' having blocked my immediate winning opportunity by taking position5, I need to continue the game strategically.\n\nTo proceed, I'll place my next 'O' in position [8] as it is one of the available moves and provides a potential future opportunity. However, I need to be cautious and anticipate 'X's next move.\n\nMy move: [8]\n\nCurrent Board after my move:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n6 |7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves after my move: '[6]', '[7]'\n\nLet's continue the game with the next step.\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1]  As Player 1 ('X'), I'll analyze the current board and prioritize my moves to achieve a win.

Placing my 'X' in position 8 will complete three in a row in that column, securing a win.
