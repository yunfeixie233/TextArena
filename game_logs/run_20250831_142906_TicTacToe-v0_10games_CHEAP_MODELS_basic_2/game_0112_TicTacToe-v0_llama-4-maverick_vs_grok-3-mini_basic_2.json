Then, I understand 'X' actually placed their 'X' in position 1.\n\nGiven the current state, I need to assess the best next move. 'X' has taken a strong central position (4) in their previous turn, and before that, I had taken the top-left corner (0). Now 'X' is in position (1).\n\nTo counter 'X's central control and my initial corner play, I should look for a move that either challenges 'X's position or creates a potential for me to get three in a row.\n\nSince 'X' is in position 1, and I am in position 0, I can consider playing in position 2 to potentially get three 'O's in a row in the top row.
