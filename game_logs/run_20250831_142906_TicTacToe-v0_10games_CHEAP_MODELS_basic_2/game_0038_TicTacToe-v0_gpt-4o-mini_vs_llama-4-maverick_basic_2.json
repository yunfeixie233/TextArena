Since 'O' is in positions 4 and 2, and 'X' is in position 0, I need to consider the potential threats and opportunities.\n\nA strategic move for 'X' would be to continue challenging 'O's control and build upon my existing position. Let's examine the available moves:\n\n1. **[1]**: Placing 'X' in position 1 would be a good move as it starts to build a potential row and puts pressure on 'O'.\n2. **[3]**: Placing 'X' in position 3 could be considered, but it's not as strong as [1] since it doesn't directly build on my existing corner and might not be as effective in challenging 'O'.\n3. **[5]**: Placing 'X' in position 5 could be a good counter-attack, but 'O' is well-placed to potentially counter this.\n4. **[6]**, **[7]**, **[8]**: These are other potential moves, but they may not be as immediate or impactful as [1].\n\nLet's choose **[1]** as my next move.\n\nMy move is: [1]\n\nHere's the updated board after my move:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0]  It's my turn now.
