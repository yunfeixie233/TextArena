Taking position 7 creates three in a row vertically, winning the game immediately.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Optimal move**: Claim position 7 to win via column 1 (1-4-7). This ends the game before the opponent can threaten a win on column 0.\n- **Why not other moves?**\n  - Position 3 blocks the opponent's vertical threat but misses my instant win.\n  - Positions 2, 5, or 8 offer no decisive advantage and risk the opponent winning next turn.\n\n[7]",
