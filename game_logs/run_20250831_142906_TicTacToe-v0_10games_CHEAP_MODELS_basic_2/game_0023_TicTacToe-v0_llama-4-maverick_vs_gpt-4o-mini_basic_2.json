      "observation": "\n[GAME] You are Player 0 in Tic Tac Toe.\nYour goal is to win three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the board.\nOn your turn, you should select the square number (0-8) you want to put your mark in next.\nFor example, '[4]' places your mark in the center cell of the board.\n\nAs Player 0, you will be 'O', while your opponent is 'X'.\n\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To start the game strategically, I'll consider the best opening moves. In Tic Tac Toe, the center square is often considered the most important because it gives the most flexibility for the next move. Since the board is empty, I'll choose the center square.\n\nThe center square is represented by the number 4. So, my move will be: [4]\n\nHere's how the board will look after my move:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves after my move: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]' \n\nNow it's the opponent's turn.\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] As Player 1, I will make my move. The optimal strategy is to place my mark (X) in a position that not only allows me to win but also blocks my opponent's potential winning move.\n\nGiven the current board situation, I will choose the top-left corner, which is position [0]. This helps me start building towards a potential win.\n\nSo, my move will be: [0]\n\nHere's how the board will look after my move:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves after my move: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]' \n\nNow it's the opponent's turn.\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To continue the game strategically, I'll analyze the current board and choose the best available move.\n\nCurrent Board:\n\n X |1 |2 \n---+---+---\n3 | O |5 \n---+---+---\n6 |7 |8 \n\nThe opponent has placed their 'X' in the top-left corner, and I have 'O' in the center. A strategic next move would be to place 'O' in a position that could potentially create a fork, giving me two possible ways to win.\n\nLet's consider the available moves. To create a strong chance of winning, placing 'O' in a corner is a good strategy, as it could help in creating a potential fork or controlling the corner.\n\nOne of the best options now is to place 'O' in the top-right corner ([2]), as it is a corner and keeps the options open for the next move.\n\nMy move will be: [2]\n\nHere's how the board will look after my move:\n\n X |1 | O \n---+---+---\n3 | O |5 \n---+---+---\n6 |7 |8 \n\nLet's wait for the response. \n\nThe move is: [2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1]  As Player 1, I need to assess the current board and make a strategic move to block my opponent while also working towards my own victory.\n\nCurrent Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nI see that Player 0 has two 'O's in the center and top row. If I don't block the left-middle position (cell 1), Player 0 could place another 'O' in there and create a winning move on their next turn.\n\nTherefore, I will place my 'X' in cell [1] to block Player 0.\n\nHere\u2019s how the board will look after my move:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves after my move: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]' \n\nNow it's the opponent's turn.\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To continue the game strategically, let's analyze the current board and choose the best available move.\n\nCurrent Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nThe opponent has placed their 'X' in the top-left and top-center positions, and I have 'O' in the center and top-right positions.

To create a strong chance of winning, I need to analyze the possible outcomes of each move.\n\nPlacing 'O' in the middle-left position ([3]) would give me a potential opportunity to create a fork or put pressure on the opponent's position. \n\nMy move will be: [3]\n\nHere's how the board will look after my move:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nThe move is: [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1]  Given the current board situation, I need to make a strategic move to block Player 0 while also looking for an opportunity to win.\n\nCurrent Board:\n\n```\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n```\n\nI notice that if I don't play in cell [5], Player 0 will win on their next turn by placing 'O' in that spot.
