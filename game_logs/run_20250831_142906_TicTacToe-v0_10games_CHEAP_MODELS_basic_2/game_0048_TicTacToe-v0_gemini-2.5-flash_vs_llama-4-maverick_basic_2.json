The opponent has placed their 'O' in cell 4. A good strategy is to place my 'X' in a position that gives me the most flexibility for my next move and potentially puts pressure on my opponent.\n\nPlacing my 'X' in a corner is a good starting point because it allows me to potentially create a strong diagonal or prepare for a horizontal/vertical win.

Given that my opponent has 'O's in positions 4 and 8, they might be aiming for a diagonal win if they hadn't started with the center. I need to be cautious about their potential next moves.\n\nI'll place my 'X' in a position that is strategic.
