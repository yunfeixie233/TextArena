Since 'X' is in position 0, a good response would be to place 'O' in a position that could potentially block 'X's future winning line.\n\nLet's analyze further:\n- If 'X' was to go for a win, they might try to occupy positions 1 and 2 to get three in a row. So, playing in either 1 or 2 could be strategic.\n- Placing 'O' in position 8 is also a good move, as it is a corner and not immediately adjacent to 'X'.\n\nGiven the available options and the need to be strategic, I will choose position 8 for my next 'O'.
