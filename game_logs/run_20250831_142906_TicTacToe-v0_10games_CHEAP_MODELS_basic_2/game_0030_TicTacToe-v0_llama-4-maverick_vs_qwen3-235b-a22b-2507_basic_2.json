'O' has been placed in cells 1, 4, and 8 (if we were to correct the sequence and follow the actual last state before this). However, the actual position is that 'O' is in cells 1, 4, and supposedly should have been considered for a strategic next move based on the correct sequence.\n\nTo continue with the actual game state:\n```\nX | O | X \n---+---+---\n3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n6 | 7 | O \n```\n\nSince 'O' is in cells 1, 4, and 8 (as per the corrected understanding), let's re-evaluate: 'O' is actually in cells 1, 4, and it should be considered that 'O' was in cell 8 for a strategic analysis. However, the actual last known state was:\n```\nX | O | X \n---+---+---\n3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n6 | 7 | O \n```\n\nLet's directly analyze the given board state:\n```\nX | O | X \n---+---+---\n3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n6 | 7 | O \n```\n\nHere, 'O' has three 'O's, and it seems 'O' has won.\n\nMy analysis shows that 'O' is already in a winning state.\n\nHowever, to follow the format and provide a next step, even though 'O' has won:\nThe available moves are: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n\nOne of the available moves can be chosen.\n\nMy move is: [3]\n\nThe updated board will look like this:\n```\nX | O | X \n---+---+---\nO | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n6 | 7 | O \n```\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To determine the next move, I'll analyze the current state of the board.\n\nThe current board is:\n```\nX | O | X \n---+---+---\nO | O | X \n---+---+---\n6 | 7 | 8 \n```\n\nAs 'O', my goal is still to win the game by getting three 'O's in a row. Since the current state of the board has 'O' in cells 1, 3, and 4, and 'X' has placed their symbol in cell 5, I need to consider the available moves and choose a strategic one.\n\nThe available moves are: '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n\nLet's examine the available options. To win or block 'X' from winning (though 'X' hasn't got three in a row yet), I should consider the corners and other strategic positions.\n\nPlacing 'O' in one of the available corners or strategic positions could be a good move. The corners available are '[6]' and '[8]'.\n\nLet's directly choose a corner that could be a good starting point.\n\nMy move is: [8]\n\nThe updated board will look like this:\n```\nX | O | X \n---+---+---\nO | O | X \n---+---+---\n6 | 7 | O \n```\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [7]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | X | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[8]'",
