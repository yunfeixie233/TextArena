My 'X' is in position 8. I should prioritize controlling the center or creating a potential winning line.\n\nSince the opponent has two 'O's in a row (positions 3 and 4), I'll focus on countering their potential three-in-a-row and setting up my own chances. \n\nI'll place my next 'X' in position 5, aiming to potentially create a winning line and challenge the opponent.\n\nMy move: [5]\n\nSo, the command is: [5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  [6]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To make my next move, I'll analyze the current state of the board.\n\nCurrent Board:\n \n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | X \n\nThe opponent has placed their 'O' in position 6, and I need to respond strategically. My 'X' is in positions 5 and 8. The opponent now has three 'O's, but not in a row that would immediately win them the game.\n\nI should focus on blocking their potential winning lines and setting up my own chances. The opponent's 'O's are in positions 3, 4, and 6, which doesn't form a winning line yet, but position 7 is still available to them.\n\nTo counter this, I'll place my next 'X' in position 7, aiming to potentially block their winning line and create my own.\n\nMy move: [7]\n\nSo, the command is: [7]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | X | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]'\n[Player 0]   [9]\n[GAME] Player 0 attempted an invalid move.
