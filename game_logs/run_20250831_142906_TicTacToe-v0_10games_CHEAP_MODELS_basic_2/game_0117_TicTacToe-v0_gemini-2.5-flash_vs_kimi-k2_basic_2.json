Diagonal 2-4-6: O-O-X (no immediate threat)\n2. Top row 0-1-2: X-1-O (no immediate threat)\n\nThe critical line is the right-hand column 2-5-8: O-P-O, where [5] is open. If I don\u2019t take [5], my opponent will win on their next turn by completing the vertical three-in-a-row (O-O-O).\n\n[5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] Analyze the board.  \n- Rows: top row has X-O-X (no immediate win/loss); middle row is completed with O-O-X (no winner); bottom row has X-7-O (not yet).  \n- Columns: left column has X-O-X (complete); middle column 1-O-7 (open); right column O-X-O (complete).  \n- Diagonals: 0-4-8 has X-O-O, no three; 2-4-6 has O-O-X, no three.\n\nThere\u2019s one open straight line: middle column 1-4-7 which is currently empty-empty-O (from top to bottom). Only two cells remain: [1] and [7]. I must pick either one.\n\nIf I play [7], I create an immediate threat on the bottom-row diagonal 6-7-8: X-X-O, which is not a win, but keeps pressure.\n\nHowever, looking ahead, with only two cells left the game ends in a draw after the last two moves. To improve share of the board and ensure parity, I\u2019ll take the lower available cell in the middle column.\n\n[7]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[7]'\n[Player 0] You made an illegal move.
