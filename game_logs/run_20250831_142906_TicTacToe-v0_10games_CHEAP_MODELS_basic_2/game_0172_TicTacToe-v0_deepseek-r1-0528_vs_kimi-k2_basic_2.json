Anti-diagonal (2,4,6) would require two more moves to threaten a win.\n  - No other winning lines are available.\n\n### Defensive Considerations\n- Opponent has no immediate win threat:\n  - Top row (0,1,2) is already blocked (X-O-X).\n  - Left column (0,3,6) would require opponent to play cell 6, but it's not an immediate threat.\n  - Middle row (3,4,5): Opponent controls 3 (X), but cell 5 is empty\u2014if opponent played there next, it would not win (X,O,X).\n\n### Decision\n- **Play cell 7** to win the game via vertical three-in-a-row (positions 1, 4, 7).\n- No need to consider alternatives\u2014this ends the game.\n\n**[7]**",
