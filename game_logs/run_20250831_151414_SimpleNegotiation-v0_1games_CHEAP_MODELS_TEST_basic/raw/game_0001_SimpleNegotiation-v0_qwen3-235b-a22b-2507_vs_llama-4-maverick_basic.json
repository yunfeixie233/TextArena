Given the current values:\n- The highest value resources are Ore (35) and Brick (29).\n- The lowest value resources are Wheat (6) and Wood (10).\n\n### Step 4: Formulate a Trade Offer\n\nWe should try to trade Wheat and/or Wood for Brick and/or Ore if possible. Let's formulate an offer.\n\nWe have:\n- Wheat: 9\n- Wood: 22\n\nWe could offer some Wheat and/or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's consider offering 4 Wheat (value = 24) and 2 Wood (value = 20) for 1 Ore (value = 35). The total offered value is 44, and the requested value is 35. While this isn't a good deal for us, it's a starting point.\n\n### Step 5: Create the Trade Offer\n\nOffer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore\n\nUsing the special tokens format: `[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\n### Step 6: Output the Action\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis is the trade offer for the current turn.",

Although it's a gain, it was not a very efficient trade in terms of value.\n\n3. **Consider the Rejected Offer:**\n   - The rejected offer was `[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]`. Player 1 would have lost resources worth (4*6) + (2*10) = 24 + 20 = 44 and gained 1 Ore worth 35. This trade would have resulted in a net loss of 9.\n\n4. **Formulate a New Offer:**\n   - We need to identify a trade that increases the total value. Given the current resources, we can consider offering resources that are less valuable and requesting those that are more valuable or at least balancing the trade.\n   - One potential trade is to offer some Wheat or Wood (lower value resources) for Ore (higher value resource), but given the rejection last time, the terms need to be more favorable.\n\n5. **Propose a Trade:**\n   - Let's consider: `[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n   - This trade involves giving up 3 Wood (3 * 10 = 30) for 1 Ore (1 * 35 = 35), resulting in a net gain of 5.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]`",
