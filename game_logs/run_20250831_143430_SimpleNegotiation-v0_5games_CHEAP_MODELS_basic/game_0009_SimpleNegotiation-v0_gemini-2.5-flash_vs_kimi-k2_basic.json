This was a 255 value offer for 142 value request, so likely too greedy.\n\nLet's try to offer something that is beneficial for both, considering Player 1 is also trying to increase their total value.\n\nPerhaps offer some Brick and Wheat for Ore, but with a more balanced value exchange. Or try to get Wood, which is cheap for me, and maybe valuable for Player 1.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, as it's the most valuable resource. Willing to give up some less valuable resources.\n\nOffer 5 Brick and 5 Wheat for 1 Ore.\nMy value offered: (5 * 23) + (5 * 5) = 115 + 25 = 140\nMy value requested: (1 * 36) = 36\nThis is still greedy.\n\nLet's try to balance it more. Player 1 rejected the previous offer, which means they found it unbalanced.\nI have a lot of Brick and Wheat. Let's try to trade Brick for Ore.\n\nOffer: 2 Brick for 1 Ore.\nMy value offered: 2 * 23 = 46\nMy value requested: 1 * 36 = 36\nStill profitable for me.\n\nLet's try to sell some Brick and Wheat for more valuable items. Perhaps Sheep.\nOffer 5 Wheat for 2 Sheep.\nMy value offered: 5 * 5 = 25\nMy value requested: 2 * 17 = 34\nThis is favorable to the other Player, but gets me more valuable items. I can afford to give away Wheat.\n\nLet's make a more attractive offer for Ore.\nHow about 5 Brick + 5 Wheat for 2 Ore?\nMy value offered: (5 * 23) + (5 * 5) = 115 + 25 = 140\nMy value requested: (2 * 36) = 72\nStill profitable.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the previous offer of 10 Brick (230) + 5 Wheat (25) = 255 for 3 Ore (108) + 2 Sheep (34) = 142. This was indeed very greedy.\n\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of Brick for a smaller amount of Ore?\n[Offer: 10 Brick -> 2 Ore]\nMy value offered: 10 * 23 = 230\nMy value requested: 2 * 36 = 72\nStill heavily in my favor.\n\nLet's consider that Player 1 might also have some goals regarding specific resources.\nI have plenty of Brick and Wheat. Let's try to increase my Sheep or Ore count.\n\nLet's try offering a mix of my less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 5 Brick -> 2 Ore]\nMy value offered: (8 * 5) + (5 * 23) = 40 + 115 = 155\nMy value requested: (2 * 36) = 72\nThis is still quite greedy from my side.\n\nI need to make an offer that feels mutually beneficial, or at least not obviously lopsided for Player 1.\nLet's try to acquire more Sheep, as it's a good mid-range value.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick, 5 Wheat -> 3 Sheep]\nMy value offered: (5 * 23) + (5 * 5) = 115 + 25 = 140\nMy value requested: (3 * 17) = 51\nStill greedy.\n\nWhat if I offer something that is very low value to me, in exchange for mid-value?\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Wood]\nMy value offered: 10 * 5 = 50\nMy value requested: 3 * 8 = 24\nStill greedy.\n\nLet's try to balance the value more.\nI need to increase my total value. To do that, I need to trade low-value items I have in excess for high-value items, or trade items I have and are useful to the opponent for items I need.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 needs Brick or Wheat.\nPlayer 1 rejected the previous offer without making a counter-offer, which could suggest they found it totally unacceptable.\n\nI will try to make an offer that is closer to a fair exchange, leaning slightly in my favor.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nMy value offered: 5 * 8 = 40\nMy value requested: 1 * 36 = 36\nThis is a small gain for me, with a relatively low cost. This gives Player 1 5 Wood, which might be useful to them. I have 5 Wood, so I would be offering all of it. This might be too much.\n\nLet's keep the resources I have a good quantity of. Brick and Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 7 Brick -> 2 Ore]\nMy value offered: 7 * 23 = 161\nMy value requested: 2 * 36 = 72\nStill too greedy on my part.\n\nI need to offer *more* value than I request, but still gain overall by getting higher value individual items, or items I prefer to have.\nOr offer something that is clearly good for Player 1.\n\nLet's try to shed Wheat and Brick for something more valuable.\nHow about a neutral or slightly positive trade for Player 1?\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Brick -> 1 Ore, 2 Sheep]\nMy value offered: (10 * 5) + (5 * 23) = 50 + 115 = 165\nMy value requested: (1 * 36) + (2 * 17) = 36 + 34 = 70\nStill too imbalanced.\n\nMaybe they need Sheep.\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Sheep]\nMy value offered: 5 * 23 = 115\nMy value requested: 2 * 17 = 34\nToo high.\n\nWhat if I just offer a simple trade?\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nMy Offered Value: 3 * 23 = 69\n[Request: 1 Ore]. My Requested Value: 1 * 36 = 36\nThis is beneficial for me, but still offers a good chunk of Brick to player 1.\n\nLet's make an offer that is genuinely more balanced, but still leads to me having more valuable resources.\nThe core of the game is to increase my value.\n\nConsider trading away less valuable individual items (Wheat, Wood, Sheep, Brick) for high-value items (Ore, Brick).\n\nI have 19 Brick (Value 23), 20 Wheat (Value 5).\nI want more Ore (Value 36).\n\n[Offer: 8 Brick, 5 Wheat -> 3 Ore]\nMy value offered: (8 * 23) + (5 * 5) = 184 + 25 = 209\nMy value requested: (3 * 36) = 108\nStill very much in my favor.\n\nI need to be more generous. If I offer too little, they will keep rejecting.\nWhat if I offer something for Wood, which is less valuable for me?\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 4 Wood]\nMy value offered: 15 * 5 = 75\nMy value requested: 4 * 8 = 32\nStill very generous to myself.\n\nI have 20 Wheat. Trading some is good.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]\nMy value offered: 10 * 5 = 50\nMy value requested: 2 * 17 = 34\nNet +34-50 = -16 value. I am losing value directly. This is not the goal.\nI need to increase *my* total value.\n\nLet's construct a trade where I offer items that total less value than the items I request.\nThis logic is wrong. I need to get items that are *more* valuable in total than the items I *give away*.\n\nMy total current value:\nWheat: 20 * 5 = 100\nWood: 5 * 8 = 40\nSheep: 8 * 17 = 136\nBrick: 19 * 23 = 437\nOre: 7 * 36 = 252\nTotal: 100 + 40 + 136 + 437 + 252 = 965\n\nI need to make a profitable offer for myself.\nThe previous offer was (10 Brick, 5 Wheat -> 3 Ore, 2 Sheep).\nOffered Value: (10 * 23) + (5 * 5) = 230 + 25 = 255\nRequested Value: (3 * 36) + (2 * 17) = 108 + 34 = 142\nMy profit: +142 - 255 = -113. This is correct, I give away 255 value to get 142 value. This is a bad trade for me.\n\nOkay, I miscalculated earlier. The goal is to obtain resources that increase *my* total value, meaning the *value of the resources I receive* must be greater than the *value of the resources I offer*.\n\nThe previous offer was deeply bad for me. No wonder it was rejected. I offered 255 value for 142 value.\n\nI must make an offer that results in a net gain for me from an internal value standpoint.\nLet's try to get Ore.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nMy resources: Sheep is 17, Ore is 36.\nValue offered: 3 * 17 = 51\nValue requested: 1 * 36 = 36\nThis means I give 51 value to get 36 value. Net change: -15. Not good for me.\n\nThis is the core mechanic. I need to make an offer that I profit from.\n[Offer: Offered Resources Value < Requested Resources Value]\n\nSo, for example, if I offer 1 Brick (23) for 1 Ore (36), I gain 13 value. This is the simple way to profit.\nIf Player 1 accepts this, it means they value Brick more than Ore, or they value 1 Brick more than 1 Ore.\n\nLet's try a small profit.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nValue Offered: 1 * 23 = 23\nValue Requested: 1 * 36 = 36\nNet gain for me: 36 - 23 = 13.\nThis seems like a fair opening offer after a rejection, trying to establish a trade.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
