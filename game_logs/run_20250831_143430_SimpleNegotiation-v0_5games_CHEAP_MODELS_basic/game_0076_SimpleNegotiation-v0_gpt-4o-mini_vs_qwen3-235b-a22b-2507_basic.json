      "response": "Let's analyze the resources you have and their total value:\n\n- **Wheat**: 14 at a value of 6 each = 14 * 6 = 84\n- **Wood**: 14 at a value of 11 each = 14 * 11 = 154\n- **Sheep**: 12 at a value of 15 each = 12 * 15 = 180\n- **Brick**: 23 at a value of 25 each = 23 * 25 = 575\n- **Ore**: 8 at a value of 35 each = 8 * 35 = 280\n\n**Total Value = 84 + 154 + 180 + 575 + 280 = 1273**\n\nNext, let's look at some potential trades that can increase your total value. A balanced approach would be beneficial in order to maximize your resources effectively. Here are some thoughts:\n\n1. **Brick is highly valuable** (25 each). You have a substantial amount, so perhaps offering a portion of your Bricks for a combination of lower-value resources could yield a profitable trade.\n  \n2. **Ore has a high individual value** (35 each). Trading some Ore for more common resources like Wheat or Wood could be a good strategy.\n\n3. While you need to ensure the trades are beneficial in increasing your total value, also consider that Wheat and Wood have the lowest total values, so you may want to keep them to maximize the potential increases.\n\nWith these points in mind, here's a suggested initial trade offer:\n\n**Trade Offer:**\n- Offer: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\n- Request: 3 Ore\n\nThus, the offer will look like this:\n\n`[Offer: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 3 Ore]`\n\nThis could increase your Ore quantity while reducing lower-value resources (Sheep) and still getting a large quantity of high-value Brick.",
