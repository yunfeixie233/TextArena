Brick: Qty = 16, Value = 29\n5.

This indicates that either Player 1 did not need or value the resources offered enough or had a different valuation for the resources.\n\n### Formulating a New Offer\n\nGiven that the previous offer was rejected, let's consider making a new offer.\n\n1. **Identify Potential Trades:**\n   - We need to identify a trade that increases our total resource value.\n   - Let's examine our resources and possible trades that could be beneficial.\n\n2. **Potential Trade Ideas:**\n   - Offering resources with lower values and requesting those with higher values could be a strategy.\n\n### New Offer\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat and Wood (lower value resources) for Ore (a higher value resource).\n\n- **Offer:** 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 1 Ore\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n- **Offered Resources:**\n  - 6 Wheat: Total Value = 6 * 6 = 36\n  - 4 Wood: Total Value = 4 * 9 = 36\n  - Total Value Offered = 36 + 36 = 72\n\n- **Requested Resources:**\n  - 1 Ore: Total Value = 1 * 37 = 37\n\nThis offer is not favorable as we are offering resources worth 72 for resources worth 37. Let's adjust our strategy.\n\n### Adjusted New Offer\n\nLet's directly examine the possibility of a more balanced or beneficial trade.\n\n- **Alternative Offer:** Consider offering some Sheep (Value: 12) or Brick (Value: 29) for Ore (Value: 37).\n\nLet's formulate an offer:\n- **[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]**\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n- **Offered Resources:**\n  - 2 Brick: Total Value = 2 * 29 = 58\n\n- **Requested Resources:**\n  - 1 Ore: Total Value = 1 * 37 = 37\n\nThis is not a good trade for us as we're offering more value than we're getting.\n\n### Another Alternative\n\nLet's think about another trade that involves our less valuable resources and try to negotiate for something more valuable.\n\n- **[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]**\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n- **Offered Resources:**\n  - 4 Sheep: Total Value = 4 * 12 = 48\n  - 2 Wood: Total Value = 2 * 9 = 18\n  - Total Value Offered = 48 + 18 = 66\n\n- **Requested Resources:**\n  - 2 Ore: Total Value = 2 * 37 = 74\n\nThis offer is closer in value and could be considered reasonable.\n\n### Action\n\nI'll make the following offer:\n`[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]`\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds.\n\n### Output\n`[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]`",

Increase the quantity of higher-value resources.\n2. Swap lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\nGiven our resources and the last rejected offer, let's consider an alternative.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing the last rejected offer\nThe offer was 4 Wood, 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, 2 Brick. It was beneficial as calculated above.\n\n## Step 2: Thinking about an alternative offer\nLet's consider offering something of similar or slightly higher value for something we need more of, like Ore or keeping Brick.\n\n## Step 3: Formulating a new offer\nWe could offer: [Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]. This involves giving away resources of total value (3*9 + 1*12) = 27 + 12 = 39 for 1 Ore of value 37. This is not very beneficial as it results in a net loss.\n\nLet's try to think of a more beneficial trade.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluating another potential trade\nConsidering our current quantities and values, let's directly propose a trade that could be beneficial.\n\nLet's offer: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]. \n- Giving away: 2 Sheep (2*12 = 24) and 1 Wood (1*9 = 9), total = 33.\n- Gaining: 1 Brick (1*29 = 29).\nThis results in a net loss of 33 - 29 = 4. So, it's not ideal.\n\n## Step 5: Formulating a potentially better offer\nLet's directly examine a potentially beneficial offer.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]\n\n## Step 6: Checking the value of the new offer\n- Giving away: 3 Wheat (3*6 = 18) and 2 Wood (2*9 = 18), total = 36.\n- Gaining: 2 Ore (2*37 = 74).\nTotal change = 74 - 36 = +38.\n\nThis is a potentially beneficial trade.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]}$",
