To do this, I should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or negotiate trades that result in a higher total value.\n\n### Turn 1 Analysis:\nLet's examine potential trades. Resources with higher values per unit are Ore (33) (27 (27), which are already relatively high. Sheep (17) and Wood (10) are moderate, and Wheat (6) is the lowest.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering Wheat or Wood for resources with higher values. However, without knowing the opponent's resources, I'll start by making a general offer that could be beneficial.\n\n### First Offer:\nI will offer Wheat (the lowest value resource) in exchange for something of potentially higher value. Let's say I offer 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep (since Sheep is more valuable than Wheat and Wood).\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nThis is my first move. I will wait for the opponent's response.\n\n### Response:\nWaiting for opponent's response...",

      "response": "Since I am Player 0, let's analyze my current resources and the history of trades.\n\nInitially, I had:\n- Wheat: 8, Value: 6\n- Wood: 17, Value: 10\n- Sheep: 11, Value: 17\n- Brick: 12, Value: 27\n- Ore: 12, Value: 33\n\nAfter the trades:\n1. I offered 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep. \n   - Wheat: 8 - 4 = 4\n   - Sheep: 11 + 1 = 12\n\n2. I accepted 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore from Player 1 (but I rejected it initially, so this didn't happen).\n   \n3. I accepted 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep.\n   - Wheat: 4 + 4 = 8\n   - Sheep: 12 + 1 = 13\n\n4. I accepted 1 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore.\n   - Sheep: 13 + 1 = 14\n   - Brick: 12 + 1 = 13\n   - Ore: 12 - 1 = 11\n\nCurrent state:\n- Wheat: 8, Value: 6\n- Wood: 17, Value: 10\n- Sheep: 14, Value: 17\n- Brick: 13, Value: 27\n- Ore: 11, Value: 33\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore\n\nLet's evaluate this offer:\n- I give 1 Ore, Value: 33\n- I receive 3 Wheat, Value: 3 * 6 = 18\n- I receive 1 Wood, Value: 10\nTotal value received: 18 + 10 = 28\nSince 28 (received) is less than 33 (given), this trade is not in my favor.\n\nMy response to Player 1's offer: [Deny]\n\nI will now make a new trade offer. Let's analyze my resources again.\n\nTo increase my total value, I should try to get resources with higher values or maintain the ones I have. I have a good quantity of Brick and Ore, which are high in value. Let's see if I can offer something that is relatively lower in value to get something more valuable or equally valuable.\n\nOne potential trade could be offering some Wheat or Wood for a more valuable resource or maintaining the balance.\n\nLet's make an offer: [Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n\nMy thought process:\n- I give 2 Wood, Value: 2 * 10 = 20\n- I receive 1 Brick, Value: 27\nThis trade increases my total value since 27 (received) is greater than 20 (given).\n\nAction: [Deny] for the incoming offer, followed by [Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n\nSo, my turn action is: \n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]",
