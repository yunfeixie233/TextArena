I would like to obtain more Sheep while offering goods whose value ratio to Sheep looks attractive to my opponent. However, Sheep\u2019s 14-point value is lower than Brick\u2019s 27 and Ore\u2019s 35, so in any \u201cpure\u201d n Sheep \u2194 m Brick/Ore offer the Sheep side looks weak on paper.\n\nTherefore, to sweeten the deal while still improving my total value, I can offer a combination that includes Wheat/Wood plus some of my plentiful Ore in return for a bundle that contains extra Sheep. One straightforward structure is:\n\nGive: 4 Wheat (4\u00b75 = 20) + 3 Ore (3\u00b735 = 105)  \nReceive: 7 Sheep (7\u00b714 = 98)\n\nNet gain for me: 98 \u2212 (20+105) = 98 \u2212 125 = \u221227 direct value (that\u2019s bad).  \nThis is why such a simple swap is unlikely to be persuasive.

I want to push high-count/low-value goods into higher-value ones while keeping enough of everything to build.\n- Brick and Ore are already high-value to me (27 and 35) so I\u2019m not eager to trade them away unless the bundle heavily favors me.\n- P1 has (implicitly) turned down pure resource-for-sheep proposals twice, so additional straight \u201cwheat+wood for sheep\u201d offers are unlikely to be accepted; they either want some Brick/Ore, or they want more value on their side. I need to make concessions or add Ore/Brick I can afford to part with.\n\nCurrent net values before next offer:\n- Wheat: 20\u00d75 = 100\n- Wood: 19\u00d78 = 152\n- Sheep: 5\u00d714 = 70\n- Brick: 10\u00d727 = 270\n- Ore: 19\u00d735 = 665  \nCurrent total = 1,257.\n\nIf I could convert 10 Wheat into 7 Sheep, I\u2019d gain 7\u00d714 \u2013 10\u00d75 = 98 \u2013 50 = 48 value. But pure swaps have failed, so I\u2019ll try offering Ore or Brick to sweeten the deal.\n\nEvaluate what I can safely give away:  \n- I have 10 Brick. Giving 3 still leaves 7.  \n- I have 19 Ore. Giving 1 still leaves 18.  \n\nProposed trade package (turn 4):\nOffer 7 low-value resources plus 1 high-value Ore in exchange for 8 mid-value Sheep and a return Ore so P1 isn\u2019t scared of depleting their Ore.\nLeaves both of us with round counts and balances perceived value.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat, 1 Ore -> 8 Sheep, 1 Ore]",
