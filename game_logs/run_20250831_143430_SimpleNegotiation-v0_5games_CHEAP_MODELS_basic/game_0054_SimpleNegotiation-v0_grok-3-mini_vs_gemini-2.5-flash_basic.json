While it doesn't increase my total value, it also doesn't decrease it. Given the game is about increasing total value, a neutral trade isn't ideal unless it sets me up for a better future trade. However, there's no immediate strategic advantage to accepting this. I have plenty of Brick and Wheat, and a fair amount of Wood.\n\nI aim to increase my total value. I will deny this offer and propose one that helps me achieve that goal. I have a good amount of Ore, which is very valuable. I also have a good amount of Brick. I could try to trade some less valuable resources for more valuable ones, or trade some of my high-value resources for an even higher value.\n\nI will propose a trade where I offer resources that are relatively less valuable to me (like Sheep or Wheat) for more valuable resources, or a quantity of a resource I have plenty of (like Brick) for something I need or is more valuable.\n\nLet me try to trade some of my Sheep or Wheat for something more valuable like Ore, or perhaps trade some less valuable resources for more Brick if I can get a good deal.\n\nMy goal is to increase Value. I will deny this offer as it does not increase my value.\n\nLet me craft a counter-offer. I have 24 Ore, which is very valuable. I have 21 Brick. I have plenty of Sheep, Wheat, and Wood.\n\nI will try to trade some surplus Sheep for something more valuable.\nOr, I can try to trade some Brick for Ore.\n\nCurrently:\nWheat: 19 (5)\nWood: 18 (11)\nSheep: 20 (16)\nBrick: 21 (21)\nOre: 24 (40)\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, or use Ore to get something even better if possible later. I will ask for Ore.\n\nI have 20 Sheep (Value 16). I have 21 Brick (Value 21).\n\nLet's offer a combination of lower value resources for a higher value one.\n\nI could offer 3 Sheep (3 * 16 = 48) and 1 Wood (1 * 11 = 11) = 59 value\nfor 1 Ore (40) and 1 Wheat (5) = 45 value. This is a negative value trade for me.\n\nI need to get more value.\n\nLet's deny and make my own offer.\nPlayer 0's offer: 4 Wheat (20), 2 Wood (22) -> 2 Brick (42). My value gained = 42, my value lost = 42. So 0 net gain.\n\nI want to make an offer that increases my value.\nI have a good quantity of Sheep (20). Value 16.\nI also have a good quantity of Wheat (19). Value 5.\n\nLet's try to trade some Wheat and Sheep for Ore.\nSay, 5 Wheat (25) + 3 Sheep (48) = 73.
