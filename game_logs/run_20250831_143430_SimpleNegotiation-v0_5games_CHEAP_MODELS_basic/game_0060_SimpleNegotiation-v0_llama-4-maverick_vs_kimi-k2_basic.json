However, we need to be cautious as we've just gained Ore. Let's examine our resources again and consider making an offer that involves resources we have in abundance relative to their value.\n\nLet's make an offer: \n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\n\nThis involves offering resources that are relatively less valuable for something more valuable. Let's see the calculation:\n- 4 Wheat = 4*5 = 20\n- 2 Sheep = 2*14 = 28\n- Total offered: 20 + 28 = 48\n- 1 Brick = 1*22 = 22 (we are getting less than what we are giving)\n\nLet's revise our strategy and think about an alternative.\n\nAlternative offer:\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep]\n\nLet's analyze:\n- We have 15 Wood, and the value is 11.\n- 2 Wood = 2*11 = 22\n- 1 Sheep = 1*14 = 14 (we are losing value)\n\nLet's think about a more balanced trade or one that involves less valuable resources for us.\n\nAlternative offer:\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Wood]\n\nLet's analyze:\n- 3 Wheat = 3*5 = 15\n- 1 Wood = 1*11 = 11 (still not very beneficial)\n\nConsidering the resources we have and their values, and thinking about what's likely to be accepted, let's directly propose a potential trade that might be more balanced or beneficial.\n\nLet's directly make a trade offer that involves our less valuable resources for something of potentially higher value or similar.\n\nConsidering the constraints and aiming to increase our total value, we should re-evaluate the last trade and the current state.\n\nLet's make a new offer:\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nAnalysis:\n- We have 10 Wheat.\n- 5 Wheat = 5*5 = 25\n- 1 Ore = 1*32 = 32\n- Net gain = 32 - 25 = 7\n\nThis seems like a potentially good trade since we are gaining value.\n\nThe response is: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
