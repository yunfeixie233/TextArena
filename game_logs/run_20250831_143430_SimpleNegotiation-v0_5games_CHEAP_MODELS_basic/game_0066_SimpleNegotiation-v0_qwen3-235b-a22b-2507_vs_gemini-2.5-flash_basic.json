Net change: -79.\nAnd we just lost 2 Brick (Value: 58) and gained 1 Ore (Value: 40). Net change: -18.\n\nIt seems my previous calculations were significantly off. Trading Wood and Brick for Ore and Sheep at those rates has been detrimental. My goal is to increase the value of my resources.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Ore is my most valuable resource per unit. Brick is also quite valuable. Sheep and Wood are less valuable. Wheat is the least valuable.\n\nI need to gain more high-value resources (Ore, Brick) and give away lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep).\n\nCurrent high-value resources:\nOre: 18 * 40 = 720\nBrick: 20 * 29 = 580\n\nCurrent low-value resources:\nWheat: 18 * 6 = 108\nWood: 12 * 12 = 144\nSheep: 26 * 14 = 364\n\nMy previous trades were net negative. I should focus on trades where I gain more value than I give.\nFor example, trading low-value items for high-value items, or trading a few high-value items for a lot more high-value items if the ratio is beneficial.\n\nPlayer 0 has been accepting offers where I give up Brick for Ore, even though in the last two trades it was a net loss for me. I need to be more careful.\n\nLet's try to offload some Wheat or Wood, or gain more high-value resources.\n\nIf I give 2 Brick (58 value) and gain 1 Ore (40 value), that's a loss of 18. This is bad.\n\nPerhaps I can try to give away Wheat or Wood for something more valuable.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wheat for a smaller quantity of Brick or Ore?\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Brick] (Value: 60 -> 58) This is still a small loss for me, but it converts low-value to high-value. This might be acceptable.\nOr better:\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore] (Value: 60 -> 40) This would be a loss.\n\nI need to focus on positive value trades.\nIf I give 1 Ore (40 Value), what can I get for it? More than 40 Value.\nMaybe 2 Brick (58 Value) or 4 Sheep (56 Value).\nThis would mean: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick] or [Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Sheep]. This would increase my total value, but reduce my highest value resource.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore or Brick by giving Wheat, Wood, or Sheep.\n\nHow about: [Offer: 15 Wood -> 3 Brick] (Value: 180 -> 87) This is a huge loss. I only have 12 Wood.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep. 26.\nValue of 26 Sheep = 364.\nValue of 18 Wheat = 108.\n\nMaybe offload Sheep for Brick or Ore.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick] (Value: 42 -> 29) This is a loss.\n\nLet's try to gain Ore, my most valuable resource.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Sheep. I also have a decent amount of Brick.\n\nLet's think about what Player 0 might need. Player 0 accepted my offers where I gave Brick and Wood for Ore and Sheep. This means Player 0 likely values Brick and Wood highly, and needs them. Or Player 0 values Ore and Sheep less.\n\nIf I need to increase total value, I want to acquire high-value resources (Ore, Brick) and part with low-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep).\n\nWhat about: [Offer: 10 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore] (Value: 60 + 24 = 84 -> 40) This is a huge loss. That's not good.\n\nI have 18 Wheat (6 value), 12 Wood (12 value), 26 Sheep (14 value), 20 Brick (29 value), 18 Ore (40 value).\n\nConsider a trade that is favorable to me, but might still be tempting for P0.\nWhat if I offer a mix of lower value items for a higher value item?\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick] (Value: 60 + 70 = 130 -> 58) This is bad for me.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore while giving a fair amount of Brick.\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore] (Value: 145 -> 80) This is a loss for me.\n\nWhat if I offer Sheep and Wheat for Brick?\n[Offer: 8 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 3 Brick] (Value: 112 + 30 = 142 -> 87) Still terrible for me.\n\nMy goal is to increase my resource value.\n\nWhat about a smaller gain trade?\nCan I offer something low-value for something slightly higher value?\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Brick] (Value: 60 -> 29) This is terrible for me.\n\nI need to get rid of my low value Wheat.\nWhat if Player 0 needs Wheat for some crafts?\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Sheep] (Value: 60 -> 14) This is a truly terrible trade.\n\nLet's look at the accepted trades:\n1) [Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Brick -> 1 Ore, 2 Sheep] (Value: 60 + 87 = 147 -> 40 + 28 = 68) Net change: -79.\n2) [Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore] (Value: 58 -> 40) Net change: -18.\n\nBoth were net negative for me. This is why my resource value is decreasing. I need to pivot my strategy.\n\nLet's try to get MORE valuable resources for FEWER valuable resources.\nSay I offer 1 Ore (40 value) for 3 Brick (87 value). This is a gain of 47.\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Brick]\nThis would be a good trade for me, but maybe Player 0 won't accept.\nPlayer 0 seems to be giving me Ore in exchange for Brick. My past negative trades are proof. So, if I ask for Brick by giving Ore, that's the opposite of what Player 0 has been doing.\n\nI need to focus on what Player 0 seems to want (Brick, Wood) and offer it at a good price for me, or what Player 0 seems to have a lot of (Ore, Sheep) and trade it at a good price for me.\n\nCurrent balance after the last trades:\nWheat: 18 * 6 = 108\nWood: 12 * 12 = 144\nSheep: 26 * 14 = 364\nBrick: 20 * 29 = 580\nOre: 18 * 40 = 720\nTotal: 1916\n\nLet's reconsider the previous offer by P0 that I rejected:\nP0: 3 Sheep, 5 Wood -> 8 Brick (Value: 42 + 60 = 102 -> 232)\nThis would have been a GOOD trade for me if I had accepted it. I would have given low-value items and received high-value items, with a net gain of 130!\nI regret denying that now. I miscalculated. My previous rejections were often due to not valuing the resources correctly.\n\nI need to keep an eye on good opportunities like that one.\n\nSince Player 0 previously offered 3 Sheep, 5 Wood for 8 Brick, Player 0 clearly wants Brick and is willing to give up Sheep and Wood for it.\nAnd I have plenty of Sheep and Wood. I also have plenty of Brick if I need to give them away for something even more valuable.\n\nSo Player 0 wants Brick. I have 20 Brick. This is a good amount.\nPlayer 0 needs Brick. I want to increase my overall value.\n\nWhat if I offer Sheep and Wood for Brick, but at a slightly more favorable ratio for me?\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 6 Wood -> 7 Brick] (Value: 56 + 72 = 128 -> 203)\nThis is a gain of 75 for me. And Player 0 seemed to like getting Brick. So this could be a good one.\nI have enough Sheep (26) and Wood (12).\n\nLet's try this. It plays on player 0's previous offer's logic.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 6 Wood -> 7 Brick]",
