The pot is 30 and it currently costs 20 to call. K7-suited is generally a fold from out of position against a single opponent unless we plan to make a move, and shorthanded movement can be profitable.\n\nSince we\u2019re only 6 hands into a 10-hand match and my image so far has been tight-folding often, a small 3-bet bluff could buy the pot outright or set up future aggression. I\u2019ll raise to 60 (three big blinds). If P1 wakes up with a hand, I can comfortably fold; if not, the stack pressure builds.\n\n[Raise 40]\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 60.\n[Player 1] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 70 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 990.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 2\u2660, 6\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2665, 8\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] Facing a pot of 30 and it costing 20 more to call from the SB with 3\u2665 8\u2663 \u2013 an unsuited, unconnected, low off-suit hand that plays terribly out of position \u2013 this is an easy fold.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 990.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2663, Q\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Call]\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 990.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2663, Q\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  [Raise 60]\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 80.\n[Player 1]  [Raise 160]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 240.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 240\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 920.00 chips | bet 80.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 760.00 chips | bet 240.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2663, Q\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] Out of position with K\u2663 Q\u2663, facing a pot of 320 and a 240-chip three-bet from the small blind (who now has only 760 behind after committing 240). \n\n- Effective stack here is 760 chips for Villain \u2013 roughly 30 % of his stack committed already.  \n- His 4-bet sizing is large, strongly indicating a premium range (JJ+ / AK).  \n- We are 910 chips deep vs the bet \u2013 if we flat we\u2019d have a very awkward SPR < 1 on the flop.  \n- Against that value-heavy range KQ-suited has about 32 % equity (simulation vs AK, QQ+). We\u2019d be risking 160 to win 320 \u2013 we\u2019re not getting even close to the price we need when called.\n\nFolding is tight but correct here; villain\u2019s range is too value-dense and we retain our tournament counter-punching ability for the final hand.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 320 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 900.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1070.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 10\u2660, J\u2666\n==============================================",
