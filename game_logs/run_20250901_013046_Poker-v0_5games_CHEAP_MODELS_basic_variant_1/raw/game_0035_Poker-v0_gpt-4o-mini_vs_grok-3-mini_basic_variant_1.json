The pot remains at 40, and since there is still no betting activity, I will choose to check again and see if my opponent wants to put any chips in the pot.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1]   With my hole cards of 10\u2663 and 4\u2665, which remain unconnected to the board of [2\u2663, 2\u2665, A\u2660, 7\u2665] and offer no pairs, draws, or potential improvements, and facing a check from Player 0 with no current bet, the wisest move is to check and avoid committing chips to a likely losing hand.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 2\u2665, A\u2660, 7\u2665, 4\u2663]\nP0 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 9\u2665, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  The river shows a 4\u2663, which still does not improve my hand of 9\u2665 and 8\u2666. Given my high card strength remains unchanged and I suspect Player 1 may have a stronger hand, I will again choose to check and allow my opponent the first action.\n\n[Check]\n Player 0 checks.\n With my hole cards of 10\u2663 and 4\u2665, I now have a pair of fours showing on the board against Player 0's high card.

I will proceed to call the 20 chips to see the flop.\n\n[Call]\n Player 0 calls 10.\n With my hole cards of 3\u2666 and 6\u2666, a weak hand without connectivity or potential draws, the best option is to fold.\n\n[Fold]\n Player 1 folds.\n Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips.

I will call the bet to continue with my hand.\n\n[Call]\n With my hole cards of 4\u2660 and Q\u2663, I have a decent hand but not strong enough to be aggressive.
