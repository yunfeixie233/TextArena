Our hand can only beat complete air, which should be less common since Villain called flop with some Ace-X (that\u2019s now Ace-high at worst), some suited connectors/gappers, or draws that just got there (any five, any six).\n\nThe pot is 110 but we only have J-high.

On this paired rainbow board (Kd-10s-8c-4d), the 7\u26605\u2660 has very little showdown value and a modest 8\u20139 outs at best. With the pot still modest (40) and my stack at 1010, betting would risk getting check-raised and we\u2019d be forced to fold out our equity. Instead, taking a free card maximizes our stack depth and keeps the pot under control.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [K\u2666, 10\u2660, 8\u2663, 4\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 1010.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2665, 9\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] I\u2019ve just hit the gin card\u2014my 5\u26607\u2660 has turned into the nuts with the 6\u2665 on the river completing the 7-6-5-4-3 straight.\n\nWith no flush possible and only \u039d\u03a4\u039d*P1 behind, I aim to get maximum value:\n\n[\u035cB\u035ce\u035ct\u035c 40\u035c]\n[GAME] Invalid action attempt 1/3: Invalid poker action.

Nice speculative hand heads-up, and the pre-flop pot odds against one opponent are good enough to see a flop, but three-betting w/ J7s out of position isn\u2019t necessary.  \n\n[Call]\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1050.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 920.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2665, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 attempted an invalid move.

I see the following:\n\n- Board: 2\u2665 3\u2665 4\u2666 6\u2666 6\u2660 \u2013 This two-spade two-diamond texture (paired 4 and 6) means:\n\n  \u2013 Any five or six fills the straight. (P1 could have hands like 65, 54, 43, 52, 42, A5).\n  \u2013 A third six now gives boating possibilities.\n  \u2013 Flush draw missed and only back-door straights are possible.\n\n- We have exactly J\u2666 7\u2666 \u2014 no pair, no straight, no flush. Our hand can only beat complete air, which should be less common since Villain called flop with some Ace-X (that\u2019s now Ace-high at worst), some suited connectors/gappers, or draws that just got there (any five, any six).\n\nThe pot is 110 but we only have J-high. Betting would accomplish very little except throwing away chips; checking behind avoids risking additional chips when we're almost certainly beat.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 110 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2665, 3\u2665, 4\u2666, 6\u2666, 6\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 1015.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 875.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2665, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 8:\nPlayer 0: J\u2666 7\u2666\nPlayer 1: J\u2665 8\u2666\nCommunity cards: 2\u2665, 3\u2665, 4\u2666, 6\u2666, 6\u2660\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 110 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 1005.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 965.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2665, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1015.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 955.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 10\u2665, 3\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] [Call]\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1015.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 955.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 10\u2665, 3\u2666\n==============================================",
