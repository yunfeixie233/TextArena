Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range.

Villain led out 20 on a paired 5-5-9 flop, then bet 40 into the enlarged pot after the J\u2663 turn.  \nThese sizing jumps imply that P0 is actually representing trip fives (or at least a strong 5) rather than a bluff.  \nMy kicker is the top kicker (ace) so I have the nut AJ here, and the remaining stack-to-pot ratio is still playable (~3.5 : 1).  \nI\u2019m happy to raise for value against trips and any other overvalued single-pair hands, while I\u2019m comfortably ahead of all bluffs.\n\n[Raise 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 120.\n[Player 0]  The turn has seen an raise from Player 1, increasing the current bet to 120 chips.

Given the previous action and the pot size of 320 chips, I need to evaluate my options carefully.\n\nSince there are no bets on the river and I still have a strong hand, I will place a bet in an attempt to extract value from any weaker hands that Player 1 may have.\n\nI will bet 100 chips.\n\n[Bet 100]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 100.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 420 | Current bet: 100\nVisible board: [5\u2663, 9\u2665, 5\u2660, J\u2663, 7\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 720.00 chips | bet 100.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 860.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2665, J\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] I hold A\u2665 J\u2666 and have now rivered top pair (J-J) with top kicker (Ace kicker) on the run-out 5\u2663 9\u2665 5\u2660 J\u2663 7\u2666.

Given the previous action and the pot size of 320 chips, I need to evaluate my options carefully.\n\nSince there are no bets on the river and I still have a strong hand, I will place a bet in an attempt to extract value from any weaker hands that Player 1 may have.\n\nI will bet 100 chips.\n\n[Bet 100]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 100.\n[Player 1] I hold A\u2665 J\u2666 and have now rivered top pair (J-J) with top kicker (Ace kicker) on the run-out 5\u2663 9\u2665 5\u2660 J\u2663 7\u2666. The board is double-paired (5-5-J-J), which reduces straights, and my AJ here is essentially the nuts unless villain has specifically a 5, 9, or 7.  \n\nVillain (SB) has led flop 20 \u2192 turn 40 \u2192 and now 100 on the river\u2014a suspiciously cautious line for trips fives, and there are only 6 combos of 5x total (55, A5, K5 suited, etc.).

Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand. However, given the situation, I will make a small continuation bet to put pressure on Player 1 and possibly take down the pot now.\n\nI will bet 20 chips.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1]  The board is paired (K-K-9) with no draws, and Villain chose a small sizing. My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range. There are also very few scary turns that would drastically change my equity. I\u2019ll call once and re-evaluate.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 20.\n[Player 1] \nThe 8\u2660 turn completes the singleton King-high flush draw \u2013 but it also brings a fourth spade, so a flush is now possible.  \nMy pocket 6\u2665 6\u2666 is essentially the same bluff-catcher as on the flop; I still only lose to pocket pairs >6 or any K, but now Villain might also have picked up back-door spades.\n\nOut of position he checks to me. Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs. I\u2019ll check behind to control the size and perhaps hit one of my two bullets on the river.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663, 8\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 680.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1240.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  The turn shows the 8\u2660, and while my A\u2660, J\u2663 has not improved, the board is now potentially dangerous with flush possibilities. Player 1 has shown some caution by checking, which could indicate they are uncertain of their hand strength.\n\nI will continue to apply pressure given that I have a high card and the initiative from the pre-flop and flop.

Villain led out 20 on a paired 5-5-9 flop, then bet 40 into the enlarged pot after the J\u2663 turn.  \nThese sizing jumps imply that P0 is actually representing trip fives (or at least a strong 5) rather than a bluff.  \nMy kicker is the top kicker (ace) so I have the nut AJ here, and the remaining stack-to-pot ratio is still playable (~3.5 : 1).  \nI\u2019m happy to raise for value against trips and any other overvalued single-pair hands, while I\u2019m comfortably ahead of all bluffs.\n\n[Raise 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 120.\n[Player 0]  The turn has seen an raise from Player 1, increasing the current bet to 120 chips.

Given the previous action and the pot size of 320 chips, I need to evaluate my options carefully.\n\nSince there are no bets on the river and I still have a strong hand, I will place a bet in an attempt to extract value from any weaker hands that Player 1 may have.\n\nI will bet 100 chips.\n\n[Bet 100]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 100.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 420 | Current bet: 100\nVisible board: [5\u2663, 9\u2665, 5\u2660, J\u2663, 7\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 720.00 chips | bet 100.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 860.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2665, J\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] I hold A\u2665 J\u2666 and have now rivered top pair (J-J) with top kicker (Ace kicker) on the run-out 5\u2663 9\u2665 5\u2660 J\u2663 7\u2666. The board is double-paired (5-5-J-J), which reduces straights, and my AJ here is essentially the nuts unless villain has specifically a 5, 9, or 7.  \n\nVillain (SB) has led flop 20 \u2192 turn 40 \u2192 and now 100 on the river\u2014a suspiciously cautious line for trips fives, and there are only 6 combos of 5x total (55, A5, K5 suited, etc.).

Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand. However, given the situation, I will make a small continuation bet to put pressure on Player 1 and possibly take down the pot now.\n\nI will bet 20 chips.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 680.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1260.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2665, 6\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  The board is paired (K-K-9) with no draws, and Villain chose a small sizing. My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range. There are also very few scary turns that would drastically change my equity.

Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs. I\u2019ll check behind to control the size and perhaps hit one of my two bullets on the river.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0]  The turn shows the 8\u2660, and while my A\u2660, J\u2663 has not improved, the board is now potentially dangerous with flush possibilities. Player 1 has shown some caution by checking, which could indicate they are uncertain of their hand strength.\n\nI will continue to apply pressure given that I have a high card and the initiative from the pre-flop and flop.

Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand.

My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range.

Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs.

Player 1 has shown some caution by checking, which could indicate they are uncertain of their hand strength.\n\nI will continue to apply pressure given that I have a high card and the initiative from the pre-flop and flop.

My hand remains A\u2660 J\u2663, which is still a strong hand but may not be enough to win against Player 1. Given the previous action and the pot size of 320 chips, I need to evaluate my options carefully.\n\nSince there are no bets on the river and I still have a strong hand, I will place a bet in an attempt to extract value from any weaker hands that Player 1 may have.\n\nI will bet 100 chips.\n\n[Bet 100]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 100.\n[Player 1] I hold A\u2665 J\u2666 and have now rivered top pair (J-J) with top kicker (Ace kicker) on the run-out 5\u2663 9\u2665 5\u2660 J\u2663 7\u2666. The board is double-paired (5-5-J-J), which reduces straights, and my AJ here is essentially the nuts unless villain has specifically a 5, 9, or 7.  \n\nVillain (SB) has led flop 20 \u2192 turn 40 \u2192 and now 100 on the river\u2014a suspiciously cautious line for trips fives, and there are only 6 combos of 5x total (55, A5, K5 suited, etc.).

Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand. However, given the situation, I will make a small continuation bet to put pressure on Player 1 and possibly take down the pot now.\n\nI will bet 20 chips.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1]  The board is paired (K-K-9) with no draws, and Villain chose a small sizing. My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range. There are also very few scary turns that would drastically change my equity.

Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs.

Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand.

My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range.

Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs.

This improves my situation significantly compared to the previous street, and I believe I have a decent chance of winning this hand. \n\nGiven the current pot of 100 chips and my hand strength, I will place a bet to extract value.

My hand remains A\u2660 J\u2663, which is still a strong hand but may not be enough to win against Player 1. Given the previous action and the pot size of 320 chips, I need to evaluate my options carefully.\n\nSince there are no bets on the river and I still have a strong hand, I will place a bet in an attempt to extract value from any weaker hands that Player 1 may have.\n\nI will bet 100 chips.\n\n[Bet 100]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 100.\n[Player 1] I hold A\u2665 J\u2666 and have now rivered top pair (J-J) with top kicker (Ace kicker) on the run-out 5\u2663 9\u2665 5\u2660 J\u2663 7\u2666. The board is double-paired (5-5-J-J), which reduces straights, and my AJ here is essentially the nuts unless villain has specifically a 5, 9, or 7.  \n\nVillain (SB) has led flop 20 \u2192 turn 40 \u2192 and now 100 on the river\u2014a suspiciously cautious line for trips fives, and there are only 6 combos of 5x total (55, A5, K5 suited, etc.). Against that tight range my AJ is still plus-EV, and the pot is 420 chips with remaining stacks of 720 and 860.  \n\nFacing only the 100-chip bet, I am getting 5.2-to-1 on a call versus any value hands he could credibly hold (A9, KJ, etc.) plus all bluffs.

I have already posted the big blind of 10 chips, and the current bet is 20 chips, which means I need to call the additional 10 chips to continue. \n\nI will call the bet.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[Player 1] A strong middle pair on a dry K-K-9 flop against a single opponent.  \n\n- My 6\u2665 6\u2666 now loses to any King (of which there are far fewer than typical thanks to the two kings on board), and I still beat all ace-high, broadway misses and smaller pocket pairs.  \n- The board is rainbow and lends itself to exactly one over-pair (AA), so villain\u2019s range is capped.  \n- Stacks are deep enough (~34 big blinds effective) that a bet here won\u2019t win the pot outright, but checking allows villain to take a stab with everything he missed.  \n\nI\u2019ll check for pot control and let the out-of-position player decide whether to build the pot with bluffs or marginal holdings.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 700.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1260.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Since Player 1 has checked the flop, I have the opportunity to take the initiative. Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand. However, given the situation, I will make a small continuation bet to put pressure on Player 1 and possibly take down the pot now.\n\nI will bet 20 chips.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1]  The board is paired (K-K-9) with no draws, and Villain chose a small sizing. My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range. There are also very few scary turns that would drastically change my equity. I\u2019ll call once and re-evaluate.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 20.\n[Player 1] \nThe 8\u2660 turn completes the singleton King-high flush draw \u2013 but it also brings a fourth spade, so a flush is now possible.  \nMy pocket 6\u2665 6\u2666 is essentially the same bluff-catcher as on the flop; I still only lose to pocket pairs >6 or any K, but now Villain might also have picked up back-door spades.\n\nOut of position he checks to me. Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs. I\u2019ll check behind to control the size and perhaps hit one of my two bullets on the river.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663, 8\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 680.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1240.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  The turn shows the 8\u2660, and while my A\u2660, J\u2663 has not improved, the board is now potentially dangerous with flush possibilities.

I have a strong hand with A\u2663 and Q\u2666, but currently, there is no direct connection to the board. Player 1 has bet 25 chips, and I need to decide if I want to call or fold.

However, considering the possible strength of my hand compared to the board, I need to assess the situation carefully. There are currently no bets.

This improves my situation significantly compared to the previous street, and I believe I have a decent chance of winning this hand. \n\nGiven the current pot of 100 chips and my hand strength, I will place a bet to extract value.

Villain led out 20 on a paired 5-5-9 flop, then bet 40 into the enlarged pot after the J\u2663 turn.  \nThese sizing jumps imply that P0 is actually representing trip fives (or at least a strong 5) rather than a bluff.  \nMy kicker is the top kicker (ace) so I have the nut AJ here, and the remaining stack-to-pot ratio is still playable (~3.5 : 1).  \nI\u2019m happy to raise for value against trips and any other overvalued single-pair hands, while I\u2019m comfortably ahead of all bluffs.\n\n[Raise 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 120.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 240 | Current bet: 120\nVisible board: [5\u2663, 9\u2665, 5\u2660, J\u2663]\nP0 (SB): 900.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 860.00 chips | bet 120.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2663, A\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  The turn has seen an raise from Player 1, increasing the current bet to 120 chips.

My hand remains A\u2660 J\u2663, which is still a strong hand but may not be enough to win against Player 1. Given the previous action and the pot size of 320 chips, I need to evaluate my options carefully.\n\nSince there are no bets on the river and I still have a strong hand, I will place a bet in an attempt to extract value from any weaker hands that Player 1 may have.\n\nI will bet 100 chips.\n\n[Bet 100]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 100.\n[Player 1] I hold A\u2665 J\u2666 and have now rivered top pair (J-J) with top kicker (Ace kicker) on the run-out 5\u2663 9\u2665 5\u2660 J\u2663 7\u2666. The board is double-paired (5-5-J-J), which reduces straights, and my AJ here is essentially the nuts unless villain has specifically a 5, 9, or 7.  \n\nVillain (SB) has led flop 20 \u2192 turn 40 \u2192 and now 100 on the river\u2014a suspiciously cautious line for trips fives, and there are only 6 combos of 5x total (55, A5, K5 suited, etc.). Against that tight range my AJ is still plus-EV, and the pot is 420 chips with remaining stacks of 720 and 860.  \n\nFacing only the 100-chip bet, I am getting 5.2-to-1 on a call versus any value hands he could credibly hold (A9, KJ, etc.) plus all bluffs.

I have already posted the big blind of 10 chips, and the current bet is 20 chips, which means I need to call the additional 10 chips to continue. \n\nI will call the bet.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[Player 1] A strong middle pair on a dry K-K-9 flop against a single opponent.  \n\n- My 6\u2665 6\u2666 now loses to any King (of which there are far fewer than typical thanks to the two kings on board), and I still beat all ace-high, broadway misses and smaller pocket pairs.  \n- The board is rainbow and lends itself to exactly one over-pair (AA), so villain\u2019s range is capped.  \n- Stacks are deep enough (~34 big blinds effective) that a bet here won\u2019t win the pot outright, but checking allows villain to take a stab with everything he missed.  \n\nI\u2019ll check for pot control and let the out-of-position player decide whether to build the pot with bluffs or marginal holdings.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 700.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1260.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Since Player 1 has checked the flop, I have the opportunity to take the initiative. Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand. However, given the situation, I will make a small continuation bet to put pressure on Player 1 and possibly take down the pot now.\n\nI will bet 20 chips.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1]  The board is paired (K-K-9) with no draws, and Villain chose a small sizing. My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range. There are also very few scary turns that would drastically change my equity. I\u2019ll call once and re-evaluate.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 20.\n[Player 1] \nThe 8\u2660 turn completes the singleton King-high flush draw \u2013 but it also brings a fourth spade, so a flush is now possible.  \nMy pocket 6\u2665 6\u2666 is essentially the same bluff-catcher as on the flop; I still only lose to pocket pairs >6 or any K, but now Villain might also have picked up back-door spades.\n\nOut of position he checks to me. Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs.

I have a strong hand with A\u2663 and Q\u2666, but currently, there is no direct connection to the board. Player 1 has bet 25 chips, and I need to decide if I want to call or fold.

Villain led out 20 on a paired 5-5-9 flop, then bet 40 into the enlarged pot after the J\u2663 turn.  \nThese sizing jumps imply that P0 is actually representing trip fives (or at least a strong 5) rather than a bluff.  \nMy kicker is the top kicker (ace) so I have the nut AJ here, and the remaining stack-to-pot ratio is still playable (~3.5 : 1).  \nI\u2019m happy to raise for value against trips and any other overvalued single-pair hands, while I\u2019m comfortably ahead of all bluffs.\n\n[Raise 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 120.\n[Player 0]  The turn has seen an raise from Player 1, increasing the current bet to 120 chips.

Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand.

My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range.

Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs.

My hole cards (5\u2666, 7\u2665) remain weak, and the board presents an Ace-heavy situation that could favor Player 1.

Since I am in the small blind position and the current bet is 20 chips, I have already put in 10 chips as part of my small blind.

However, considering the possible strength of my hand compared to the board, I need to assess the situation carefully. There are currently no bets. Given that my hand is strong, I believe I can take the initiative and bet to build the pot or potentially push Player 1 out if they have a weaker hand.\n\nI will bet 20 chips.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1] I see 5\u2663 9\u2665 5\u2660 rainbow, giving me ace-high with two over-cards.

This improves my situation significantly compared to the previous street, and I believe I have a decent chance of winning this hand. \n\nGiven the current pot of 100 chips and my hand strength, I will place a bet to extract value. I will bet 40 chips.\n\n[Bet 40]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1]  I just hit top pair (J-J) with my Ace-Jack! Villain led out 20 on a paired 5-5-9 flop, then bet 40 into the enlarged pot after the J\u2663 turn.  \nThese sizing jumps imply that P0 is actually representing trip fives (or at least a strong 5) rather than a bluff.  \nMy kicker is the top kicker (ace) so I have the nut AJ here, and the remaining stack-to-pot ratio is still playable (~3.5 : 1).  \nI\u2019m happy to raise for value against trips and any other overvalued single-pair hands, while I\u2019m comfortably ahead of all bluffs.\n\n[Raise 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 120.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 240 | Current bet: 120\nVisible board: [5\u2663, 9\u2665, 5\u2660, J\u2663]\nP0 (SB): 900.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 860.00 chips | bet 120.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2663, A\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  The turn has seen an raise from Player 1, increasing the current bet to 120 chips. I have a strong hand with a pair of Jacks and an Ace kicker (Q\u2663, A\u2660). Considering the action so far, I need to decide whether to call the raise, fold, or re-raise.

My hand remains A\u2660 J\u2663, which is still a strong hand but may not be enough to win against Player 1. Given the previous action and the pot size of 320 chips, I need to evaluate my options carefully.\n\nSince there are no bets on the river and I still have a strong hand, I will place a bet in an attempt to extract value from any weaker hands that Player 1 may have.\n\nI will bet 100 chips.\n\n[Bet 100]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 100.\n[Player 1] I hold A\u2665 J\u2666 and have now rivered top pair (J-J) with top kicker (Ace kicker) on the run-out 5\u2663 9\u2665 5\u2660 J\u2663 7\u2666. The board is double-paired (5-5-J-J), which reduces straights, and my AJ here is essentially the nuts unless villain has specifically a 5, 9, or 7.  \n\nVillain (SB) has led flop 20 \u2192 turn 40 \u2192 and now 100 on the river\u2014a suspiciously cautious line for trips fives, and there are only 6 combos of 5x total (55, A5, K5 suited, etc.). Against that tight range my AJ is still plus-EV, and the pot is 420 chips with remaining stacks of 720 and 860.  \n\nFacing only the 100-chip bet, I am getting 5.2-to-1 on a call versus any value hands he could credibly hold (A9, KJ, etc.) plus all bluffs.

I have already posted the big blind of 10 chips, and the current bet is 20 chips, which means I need to call the additional 10 chips to continue. \n\nI will call the bet.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[Player 1] A strong middle pair on a dry K-K-9 flop against a single opponent.  \n\n- My 6\u2665 6\u2666 now loses to any King (of which there are far fewer than typical thanks to the two kings on board), and I still beat all ace-high, broadway misses and smaller pocket pairs.  \n- The board is rainbow and lends itself to exactly one over-pair (AA), so villain\u2019s range is capped.  \n- Stacks are deep enough (~34 big blinds effective) that a bet here won\u2019t win the pot outright, but checking allows villain to take a stab with everything he missed.  \n\nI\u2019ll check for pot control and let the out-of-position player decide whether to build the pot with bluffs or marginal holdings.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 700.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1260.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Since Player 1 has checked the flop, I have the opportunity to take the initiative. Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand. However, given the situation, I will make a small continuation bet to put pressure on Player 1 and possibly take down the pot now.\n\nI will bet 20 chips.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1]  The board is paired (K-K-9) with no draws, and Villain chose a small sizing. My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range. There are also very few scary turns that would drastically change my equity. I\u2019ll call once and re-evaluate.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 20.\n[Player 1] \nThe 8\u2660 turn completes the singleton King-high flush draw \u2013 but it also brings a fourth spade, so a flush is now possible.  \nMy pocket 6\u2665 6\u2666 is essentially the same bluff-catcher as on the flop; I still only lose to pocket pairs >6 or any K, but now Villain might also have picked up back-door spades.\n\nOut of position he checks to me. Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs. I\u2019ll check behind to control the size and perhaps hit one of my two bullets on the river.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663, 8\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 680.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1240.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  The turn shows the 8\u2660, and while my A\u2660, J\u2663 has not improved, the board is now potentially dangerous with flush possibilities.

I have a strong hand with A\u2663 and Q\u2666, but currently, there is no direct connection to the board. Player 1 has bet 25 chips, and I need to decide if I want to call or fold.

Player 1 has bet 65 chips into a pot of 155 chips.

Villain led out 20 on a paired 5-5-9 flop, then bet 40 into the enlarged pot after the J\u2663 turn.  \nThese sizing jumps imply that P0 is actually representing trip fives (or at least a strong 5) rather than a bluff.  \nMy kicker is the top kicker (ace) so I have the nut AJ here, and the remaining stack-to-pot ratio is still playable (~3.5 : 1).  \nI\u2019m happy to raise for value against trips and any other overvalued single-pair hands, while I\u2019m comfortably ahead of all bluffs.\n\n[Raise 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 120.\n[Player 0]  The turn has seen an raise from Player 1, increasing the current bet to 120 chips.

Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand. However, given the situation, I will make a small continuation bet to put pressure on Player 1 and possibly take down the pot now.\n\nI will bet 20 chips.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 680.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1260.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2665, 6\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  The board is paired (K-K-9) with no draws, and Villain chose a small sizing. My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range. There are also very few scary turns that would drastically change my equity.

Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs.

My equity vs a small-blind limp-behind range is still decent\u2014SB\u2019s bet into me suggests either a 5 or pure aggression/air (a 9-high range).

This improves my situation significantly compared to the previous street, and I believe I have a decent chance of winning this hand. \n\nGiven the current pot of 100 chips and my hand strength, I will place a bet to extract value.

Villain led out 20 on a paired 5-5-9 flop, then bet 40 into the enlarged pot after the J\u2663 turn.  \nThese sizing jumps imply that P0 is actually representing trip fives (or at least a strong 5) rather than a bluff.  \nMy kicker is the top kicker (ace) so I have the nut AJ here, and the remaining stack-to-pot ratio is still playable (~3.5 : 1).  \nI\u2019m happy to raise for value against trips and any other overvalued single-pair hands, while I\u2019m comfortably ahead of all bluffs.\n\n[Raise 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 120.\n[Player 0]  The turn has seen an raise from Player 1, increasing the current bet to 120 chips. I have a strong hand with a pair of Jacks and an Ace kicker (Q\u2663, A\u2660). Considering the action so far, I need to decide whether to call the raise, fold, or re-raise.

Given the previous action and the pot size of 320 chips, I need to evaluate my options carefully.\n\nSince there are no bets on the river and I still have a strong hand, I will place a bet in an attempt to extract value from any weaker hands that Player 1 may have.\n\nI will bet 100 chips.\n\n[Bet 100]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 100.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 420 | Current bet: 100\nVisible board: [5\u2663, 9\u2665, 5\u2660, J\u2663, 7\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 720.00 chips | bet 100.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 860.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2665, J\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] I hold A\u2665 J\u2666 and have now rivered top pair (J-J) with top kicker (Ace kicker) on the run-out 5\u2663 9\u2665 5\u2660 J\u2663 7\u2666. The board is double-paired (5-5-J-J), which reduces straights, and my AJ here is essentially the nuts unless villain has specifically a 5, 9, or 7.  \n\nVillain (SB) has led flop 20 \u2192 turn 40 \u2192 and now 100 on the river\u2014a suspiciously cautious line for trips fives, and there are only 6 combos of 5x total (55, A5, K5 suited, etc.).

Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand. However, given the situation, I will make a small continuation bet to put pressure on Player 1 and possibly take down the pot now.\n\nI will bet 20 chips.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 680.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1260.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2665, 6\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  The board is paired (K-K-9) with no draws, and Villain chose a small sizing. My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range.

Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs. I\u2019ll check behind to control the size and perhaps hit one of my two bullets on the river.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0]  The turn shows the 8\u2660, and while my A\u2660, J\u2663 has not improved, the board is now potentially dangerous with flush possibilities.

My hole cards (5\u2666, 7\u2665) remain weak, and the board presents an Ace-heavy situation that could favor Player 1.

This improves my situation significantly compared to the previous street, and I believe I have a decent chance of winning this hand. \n\nGiven the current pot of 100 chips and my hand strength, I will place a bet to extract value.

Given the previous action and the pot size of 320 chips, I need to evaluate my options carefully.\n\nSince there are no bets on the river and I still have a strong hand, I will place a bet in an attempt to extract value from any weaker hands that Player 1 may have.\n\nI will bet 100 chips.\n\n[Bet 100]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 100.\n[Player 1] I hold A\u2665 J\u2666 and have now rivered top pair (J-J) with top kicker (Ace kicker) on the run-out 5\u2663 9\u2665 5\u2660 J\u2663 7\u2666.

I have already posted the big blind of 10 chips, and the current bet is 20 chips, which means I need to call the additional 10 chips to continue. \n\nI will call the bet.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[Player 1] A strong middle pair on a dry K-K-9 flop against a single opponent.  \n\n- My 6\u2665 6\u2666 now loses to any King (of which there are far fewer than typical thanks to the two kings on board), and I still beat all ace-high, broadway misses and smaller pocket pairs.  \n- The board is rainbow and lends itself to exactly one over-pair (AA), so villain\u2019s range is capped.  \n- Stacks are deep enough (~34 big blinds effective) that a bet here won\u2019t win the pot outright, but checking allows villain to take a stab with everything he missed.  \n\nI\u2019ll check for pot control and let the out-of-position player decide whether to build the pot with bluffs or marginal holdings.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 700.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1260.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Since Player 1 has checked the flop, I have the opportunity to take the initiative. Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand. However, given the situation, I will make a small continuation bet to put pressure on Player 1 and possibly take down the pot now.\n\nI will bet 20 chips.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1]  The board is paired (K-K-9) with no draws, and Villain chose a small sizing. My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range. There are also very few scary turns that would drastically change my equity. I\u2019ll call once and re-evaluate.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 20.\n[Player 1] \nThe 8\u2660 turn completes the singleton King-high flush draw \u2013 but it also brings a fourth spade, so a flush is now possible.  \nMy pocket 6\u2665 6\u2666 is essentially the same bluff-catcher as on the flop; I still only lose to pocket pairs >6 or any K, but now Villain might also have picked up back-door spades.\n\nOut of position he checks to me. Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs. I\u2019ll check behind to control the size and perhaps hit one of my two bullets on the river.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663, 8\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 680.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1240.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  The turn shows the 8\u2660, and while my A\u2660, J\u2663 has not improved, the board is now potentially dangerous with flush possibilities. Player 1 has shown some caution by checking, which could indicate they are uncertain of their hand strength.\n\nI will continue to apply pressure given that I have a high card and the initiative from the pre-flop and flop.

I have a strong hand with A\u2663 and Q\u2666, but currently, there is no direct connection to the board. Player 1 has bet 25 chips, and I need to decide if I want to call or fold.

My hand remains A\u2660 J\u2663, which is still a strong hand but may not be enough to win against Player 1. Given the previous action and the pot size of 320 chips, I need to evaluate my options carefully.\n\nSince there are no bets on the river and I still have a strong hand, I will place a bet in an attempt to extract value from any weaker hands that Player 1 may have.\n\nI will bet 100 chips.\n\n[Bet 100]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 100.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 420 | Current bet: 100\nVisible board: [5\u2663, 9\u2665, 5\u2660, J\u2663, 7\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 720.00 chips | bet 100.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 860.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2665, J\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] I hold A\u2665 J\u2666 and have now rivered top pair (J-J) with top kicker (Ace kicker) on the run-out 5\u2663 9\u2665 5\u2660 J\u2663 7\u2666. The board is double-paired (5-5-J-J), which reduces straights, and my AJ here is essentially the nuts unless villain has specifically a 5, 9, or 7.  \n\nVillain (SB) has led flop 20 \u2192 turn 40 \u2192 and now 100 on the river\u2014a suspiciously cautious line for trips fives, and there are only 6 combos of 5x total (55, A5, K5 suited, etc.). Against that tight range my AJ is still plus-EV, and the pot is 420 chips with remaining stacks of 720 and 860.  \n\nFacing only the 100-chip bet, I am getting 5.2-to-1 on a call versus any value hands he could credibly hold (A9, KJ, etc.) plus all bluffs.

Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand. However, given the situation, I will make a small continuation bet to put pressure on Player 1 and possibly take down the pot now.\n\nI will bet 20 chips.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 680.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1260.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2665, 6\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  The board is paired (K-K-9) with no draws, and Villain chose a small sizing. My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range. There are also very few scary turns that would drastically change my equity.

Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs. I\u2019ll check behind to control the size and perhaps hit one of my two bullets on the river.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0]  The turn shows the 8\u2660, and while my A\u2660, J\u2663 has not improved, the board is now potentially dangerous with flush possibilities. Player 1 has shown some caution by checking, which could indicate they are uncertain of their hand strength.\n\nI will continue to apply pressure given that I have a high card and the initiative from the pre-flop and flop.

However, considering the possible strength of my hand compared to the board, I need to assess the situation carefully. There are currently no bets.

This improves my situation significantly compared to the previous street, and I believe I have a decent chance of winning this hand. \n\nGiven the current pot of 100 chips and my hand strength, I will place a bet to extract value. I will bet 40 chips.\n\n[Bet 40]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1]  I just hit top pair (J-J) with my Ace-Jack! Villain led out 20 on a paired 5-5-9 flop, then bet 40 into the enlarged pot after the J\u2663 turn.  \nThese sizing jumps imply that P0 is actually representing trip fives (or at least a strong 5) rather than a bluff.  \nMy kicker is the top kicker (ace) so I have the nut AJ here, and the remaining stack-to-pot ratio is still playable (~3.5 : 1).  \nI\u2019m happy to raise for value against trips and any other overvalued single-pair hands, while I\u2019m comfortably ahead of all bluffs.\n\n[Raise 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 120.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 240 | Current bet: 120\nVisible board: [5\u2663, 9\u2665, 5\u2660, J\u2663]\nP0 (SB): 900.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 860.00 chips | bet 120.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2663, A\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  The turn has seen an raise from Player 1, increasing the current bet to 120 chips. I have a strong hand with a pair of Jacks and an Ace kicker (Q\u2663, A\u2660). Considering the action so far, I need to decide whether to call the raise, fold, or re-raise. My current stack gives me enough chips to call.\n\nI will call the additional 80 chips to see the river.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2663, 9\u2665, 5\u2660, J\u2663, 7\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 820.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 860.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2663, A\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  The river has revealed the 7\u2666, which does not improve my hand. My hand remains A\u2660 J\u2663, which is still a strong hand but may not be enough to win against Player 1. Given the previous action and the pot size of 320 chips, I need to evaluate my options carefully.\n\nSince there are no bets on the river and I still have a strong hand, I will place a bet in an attempt to extract value from any weaker hands that Player 1 may have.\n\nI will bet 100 chips.\n\n[Bet 100]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 100.\n[Player 1] I hold A\u2665 J\u2666 and have now rivered top pair (J-J) with top kicker (Ace kicker) on the run-out 5\u2663 9\u2665 5\u2660 J\u2663 7\u2666. The board is double-paired (5-5-J-J), which reduces straights, and my AJ here is essentially the nuts unless villain has specifically a 5, 9, or 7.  \n\nVillain (SB) has led flop 20 \u2192 turn 40 \u2192 and now 100 on the river\u2014a suspiciously cautious line for trips fives, and there are only 6 combos of 5x total (55, A5, K5 suited, etc.). Against that tight range my AJ is still plus-EV, and the pot is 420 chips with remaining stacks of 720 and 860.  \n\nFacing only the 100-chip bet, I am getting 5.2-to-1 on a call versus any value hands he could credibly hold (A9, KJ, etc.) plus all bluffs.

I have already posted the big blind of 10 chips, and the current bet is 20 chips, which means I need to call the additional 10 chips to continue. \n\nI will call the bet.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[Player 1] A strong middle pair on a dry K-K-9 flop against a single opponent.  \n\n- My 6\u2665 6\u2666 now loses to any King (of which there are far fewer than typical thanks to the two kings on board), and I still beat all ace-high, broadway misses and smaller pocket pairs.  \n- The board is rainbow and lends itself to exactly one over-pair (AA), so villain\u2019s range is capped.  \n- Stacks are deep enough (~34 big blinds effective) that a bet here won\u2019t win the pot outright, but checking allows villain to take a stab with everything he missed.  \n\nI\u2019ll check for pot control and let the out-of-position player decide whether to build the pot with bluffs or marginal holdings.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 700.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1260.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Since Player 1 has checked the flop, I have the opportunity to take the initiative. Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand. However, given the situation, I will make a small continuation bet to put pressure on Player 1 and possibly take down the pot now.\n\nI will bet 20 chips.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1]  The board is paired (K-K-9) with no draws, and Villain chose a small sizing. My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range. There are also very few scary turns that would drastically change my equity. I\u2019ll call once and re-evaluate.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 20.\n[Player 1] \nThe 8\u2660 turn completes the singleton King-high flush draw \u2013 but it also brings a fourth spade, so a flush is now possible.  \nMy pocket 6\u2665 6\u2666 is essentially the same bluff-catcher as on the flop; I still only lose to pocket pairs >6 or any K, but now Villain might also have picked up back-door spades.\n\nOut of position he checks to me. Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs. I\u2019ll check behind to control the size and perhaps hit one of my two bullets on the river.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2660, K\u2660, K\u2663, 8\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 680.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1240.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  The turn shows the 8\u2660, and while my A\u2660, J\u2663 has not improved, the board is now potentially dangerous with flush possibilities. Player 1 has shown some caution by checking, which could indicate they are uncertain of their hand strength.\n\nI will continue to apply pressure given that I have a high card and the initiative from the pre-flop and flop. I will place a bet of 40 chips to see if I can get a reaction from Player 1.\n\n[Bet 40]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 740.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1230.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2660, 2\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  In Hand 4, I hold J\u2660 and 2\u2660.

I have a strong hand with A\u2663 and Q\u2666, but currently, there is no direct connection to the board. Player 1 has bet 25 chips, and I need to decide if I want to call or fold.

This improves my situation significantly compared to the previous street, and I believe I have a decent chance of winning this hand. \n\nGiven the current pot of 100 chips and my hand strength, I will place a bet to extract value.

Given the previous action and the pot size of 320 chips, I need to evaluate my options carefully.\n\nSince there are no bets on the river and I still have a strong hand, I will place a bet in an attempt to extract value from any weaker hands that Player 1 may have.\n\nI will bet 100 chips.\n\n[Bet 100]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 100.\n[Player 1] I hold A\u2665 J\u2666 and have now rivered top pair (J-J) with top kicker (Ace kicker) on the run-out 5\u2663 9\u2665 5\u2660 J\u2663 7\u2666. The board is double-paired (5-5-J-J), which reduces straights, and my AJ here is essentially the nuts unless villain has specifically a 5, 9, or 7.  \n\nVillain (SB) has led flop 20 \u2192 turn 40 \u2192 and now 100 on the river\u2014a suspiciously cautious line for trips fives, and there are only 6 combos of 5x total (55, A5, K5 suited, etc.).

Although my hole cards (A\u2660, J\u2663) do connect favorably with the board (K\u2660, K\u2663, 9\u2660) for potential high cards, there are two Kings on the board that could potentially connect with Player 1's hand. However, given the situation, I will make a small continuation bet to put pressure on Player 1 and possibly take down the pot now.\n\nI will bet 20 chips.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1]  The board is paired (K-K-9) with no draws, and Villain chose a small sizing. My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range. There are also very few scary turns that would drastically change my equity. I\u2019ll call once and re-evaluate.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 20.\n[Player 1] \nThe 8\u2660 turn completes the singleton King-high flush draw \u2013 but it also brings a fourth spade, so a flush is now possible.  \nMy pocket 6\u2665 6\u2666 is essentially the same bluff-catcher as on the flop; I still only lose to pocket pairs >6 or any K, but now Villain might also have picked up back-door spades.\n\nOut of position he checks to me. Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs.

My pocket 6s are essentially bluff-catchers: I beat unpaired broadways (A-Q, A-J etc.) and lose only to pocket pairs 7-7+ or any King (which are rare because two Kings are already on the board). Villain\u2019s range is quite wide after he just flatted pre-flop and is capable of c-betting with air.\n\nAt pot odds of 4-to-1 I only need to be right ~20 % of the time to make the call profitable, and I\u2019m ahead of more than that share of Villain\u2019s range.

Without a spade in my hand I don\u2019t want to build a big pot because I\u2019m behind all flushes (however few) and Kings, while ahead of missed broadway/ace-high bluffs.

To remain in the hand, I need to call the additional 10 chips.\n\nI will call the bet.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [6\u2666, 2\u2665, 8\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 720.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1240.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  I have A\u2666 2\u2666 and flopped the nut-flush draw (four diamonds still unseen), plus a pair of deuces on board 6\u2666 2\u2665 8\u2663.  \nVillain (BB) has checked to me.  \n\n- Equity: even if villain has an over-pair, I\u2019m ~35 % with flush draw + one pair.  \n- Check-behind here allows villain to realize equity for free.  \n- A small bet (\u00bd pot) denies equity to over-cards and sometimes gets folds now; it also builds the pot for when I do hit.  \n- Stack-to-pot is large (\u2248 32 BB effective), so implied odds are excellent.  \n\nA bet of 25 gives villain ~2.6 : 1 odds\u2014enough pressure without over-committing.\n\n[Bet 25]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 25.\n[Player 0]  In Hand 5, the flop shows [6\u2666, 2\u2665, 8\u2663]. I have a strong hand with A\u2663 and Q\u2666, but currently, there is no direct connection to the board. Player 1 has bet 25 chips, and I need to decide if I want to call or fold. Given the potential to catch a higher hand with my Ace and Queen high, I will opt to call the bet.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 25.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 90 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [6\u2666, 2\u2665, 8\u2663, 10\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 695.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1215.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  I have A\u2666 2\u2666 and now I have turned the nut flush with the 10\u2666. The board is [6\u2666 2\u2665 8\u2663 10\u2666]\u2014I hold A\u2666 2\u2666-high flush (ace-high). There is also a back-door K-Q-J-9-nine-high draw still possible, but only two exact cards complete a straight flush.\n\nVillain (BB) again checks to me. Given:\n\n\u2022 I now have the stone-cold nuts unless the river produces a running K-Q-J-9 of diamonds.\n\u2022 Stack depth is still ~30 BB effective.\n\u2022 The pot sits at 90 chips.\n\nI\u2019m going to bet big enough to get stacks in by the river if villain has any hand that can call more streets (top-pair-with-diamond good or better). A size of around 65 chips leaves villain 630 behind on a ~330-chip pot on river\u2014excellent for shoving.\n\n[Bet 65]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 65.\n[Player 0]  In Hand 5, the turn has brought the 10\u2666, and I still hold A\u2663 and Q\u2666, which does not connect with the board. Player 1 has bet 65 chips into a pot of 155 chips. Given that I'm on a draw (not currently holding a winning hand), I need to decide whether to call this bet or fold.\n\nSince I have no direct connection to the board and the bet is significant, I will choose to fold.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 155 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 675.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1295.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 10\u2666, K\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   In Hand 6, I hold 4\u2665 and 5\u2663. As the small blind, I have already put in 20 chips. The current bet is 20 chips, meaning I must decide whether to call, check, or fold. Given that my hand is relatively low-card and not particularly strong, I will choose to fold.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 665.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1305.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 2\u2663, 3\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 675.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1295.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 2\u2665, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  In Hand 8, I have K\u2665 and 9\u2666, a decent hand. I am in the small blind position and have already posted 20 chips. The current bet is 20 chips, which means I am already committed with my small blind. To continue, I need to call or fold, but since I have already put in the minimum required amount, I will check.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 675.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1295.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 2\u2665, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 695.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1275.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2660, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Call]\n[Player 0]  In Hand 9, I hold a pocket pair of 6\u2666 and 6\u2660, a strong hand.

I\u2019ll bet 20.\n\n[Bet 20]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 20.\n[Player 0]  In Hand 9, the flop shows [9\u2665, J\u2663, K\u2665]. While I hold a pocket pair of 6\u2666 and 6\u2660, my hand is currently not strong in this situation. Given that Player 1 has bet 20 chips into a pot of 60 chips, I must evaluate whether to call, fold, or raise.\n\nSince my pocket sixes are likely behind on this board, and I'm facing a bet from an opponent who might have connected well with the flop, I will choose to fold.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 60 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 665.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1305.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 8\u2665, 5\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  In Hand 10, I hold A\u2663 and 10\u2663, a strong hand, especially as I am in the small blind position.

      "response": "I\u2019m holding 8\u2665 5\u2663 in the big blind, a weak off-suit holding that rarely connects favorably. There\u2019s a 30-chip pot and I\u2019ve already invested the 10-chip big blind. Villain (SB) has the betting initiative with 20 chips posted, so I must either call another 10 chips or fold.\n\nGiven the strength disparity\u2014my raggy 8-5 versus a wide but still dominated small-blind range\u2014even at 3-to-1 pot odds this looks like a low-equity spot.
