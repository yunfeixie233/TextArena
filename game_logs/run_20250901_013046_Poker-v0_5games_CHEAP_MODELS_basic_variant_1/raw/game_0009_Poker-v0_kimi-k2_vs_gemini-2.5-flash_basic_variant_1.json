My actual equity with K-high on this coordinated board against a strong range is well below that, likely under 15 %.  \n\nTherefore continuing is unprofitable.  \n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 350 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 880.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1090.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2665, 7\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 870.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1100.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 7\u2663, 4\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 880.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1090.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2660, A\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] I\u2019m in the small-blind holding A\u26666\u2660.  \nThe pot is 30 and I have to call only 10 more (20 was posted; the difference is 10).  \nAce-high from the SB is a definite play.

There\u2019s both a straight draw and two hearts on the flop.  \nMy hand has almost zero equity when Villain has any king, queen, or heart draw. Since checks probably invite a sensible bet from the button, I\u2019ll take the free card and keep the pot small rather than put chips in jeopardy.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1]  [Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 180 | Current bet: 80\nVisible board: [5\u2663, K\u2665, Q\u2665]\nP0 (SB): 850.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 80.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2660, A\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  I\u2019m still drawing only with ace-high (6\u2117-high kicker) on a K\u2665 Q\u2665 5\u2663 rainbow flop.  \nVillain has fired 80 into 100\u2014over-betting the pot on an unpaired, coordinated board. Their range after the pre-flop call is wide but still contains tons of K-x, Q-x, heart draws and straight draws that all crush me. My equity is under 15 %.\n\nFacing an 80-chip bet into an 180-chip pot (~2.25 : 1), I need at least 31 % equity to continue. I\u2019m no-where near that.

This hand is weak offsuit trash; it\u2019s dominated by almost everything and flops poorly in a 2-player pot. Fold equity vs the raiser is low, and I am OOP for the entire hand.
