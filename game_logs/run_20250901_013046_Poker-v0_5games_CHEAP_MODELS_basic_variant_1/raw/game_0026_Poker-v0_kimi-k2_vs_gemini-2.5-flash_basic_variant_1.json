You are out of position for the rest of the hand, and your hand doesn't have enough equity to justify a raise or a call for 20 chips.

This increases fold-equity for pure steals.\n\nConsidering the meta:\n\u2013 High fold frequency from P1 in the BB (\u223c75 % so far).  \n\u2013 Our hand blocks some of their continuing range (Kings).  \n\u2013 Frequency balance: we need some King-high / King-blocker steals to balance value opens.\n\nA reasonable play here is to min-raise to 20 (total 40 chips), risking 20 to win 30. Heads-up, that needs only ~40 % fold equity, and an opponent who folds 75 % gives us an immediate profit even when we\u2019re behind when called.\n\n[Raise 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 50 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2666, 4\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  Evaluating:\n\n- Your cards: K\u2666 4\u2665 \u2013 A King-high hand with a weak kicker, unsuited. Better than some earlier hands, but still relatively weak.\n- Position: You are the Big Blind (last to act this round), and also the Dealer.\n- Pot: 50 chips.\n- Current bet: Player 0 (SB) raised to 40.\n- It's 30 more to call (you already have 10 in the big blind).\n- Stack sizes: You have 970 chips, your opponent has 980 chips.\n\nPlayer 0 opened for a min-raise from the Small Blind (40 chips total). While K4o is not a premium hand, it does contain a King, which can hit top pair. However, the 4-kicker makes it vulnerable. Player 0 has been aggressive from the SB, often stealing blinds. Calling 30 more chips to see a flop with K4o is borderline. However, with Player 0's aggressive tendencies from the SB, and the fact that we're getting 50 chips in the pot for 30 more, the pot odds are somewhat favorable. Folding is an option to preserve chips, especially if we suspect Player 0 has a stronger King. Raising is not advisable with this hand. Given the history of Player 0 stealing, a call might be warranted to see if we can hit something cheap, or if they continue to bet wildly on the flop.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 30.\n[Player 0]  Evaluating:\n\n- Hole cards: K\u2663 6\u2660 \u2013 no pair, no straight draw, just one over-card and a weak six kicker.\n- Board: 4\u2666 A\u2660 6\u2665 \u2013 we paired the 6 on the flop but it\u2019s bottom pair on an ace-high board with an over-card that beats us. Villain has called the pre-flop raise and now acts behind us, so his range includes any ace, any pair above sixes, and any two-broadway hands.\n- Pot: 80 chips.\n- Position: I\u2019m out of position (Small Blind) for the rest of the hand.\n- Stack sizes: ~980 for me, ~940 for villain.\n\nBottom pair is marginal at best. Checking keeps the pot small and avoids bloating with a likely out-kicked holding. Continuation betting is not ideal here since I have little showdown value and a board that strongly hits a standard calling range from the big blind (ace-high, 6x+, pocket pairs). I\u2019ll take the free card and re-evaluate turn.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [4\u2666, A\u2660, 6\u2665]\nP0 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 940.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2666, 4\u2665\n==============================================",

Not a very strong hand, but we might be ahead if Player 0 has nothing.\n- Opponent (Player 0): 980 chips.\n- Pot: 80 chips.\n- Player 0 checked on the flop, which indicates weakness, a desire to pot control, or a trap.\n\nWith bottom pair and no draw, betting here can be risky. However, checking behind gives a free card to Player 0, who might have overcards or a better draw. Since Player 0 checked, it means they likely don't have an Ace or a strong pair. We could be ahead with our pair of Fours. Betting allows us to extract value if Player 0 calls with a weaker hand (like a non-connecting high card) or to take down the pot immediately if they fold. Given the board is somewhat coordinated (Ace, Four, Six), and we have the bottom pair, it's a bit of a tricky spot.\n\nConsidering Player 0's previous actions (min-raise from SB, then check on flop), they seem to be trying to control the pot. A small bet might test their resolve or get calls from worse hands that are still floating with overcards. A bet of around 1/2 to 2/3 pot (40-50 chips) seems reasonable. Given our hand is weak, we want to keep the pot small if called. Let's try 40.\n\n[Bet 40]",

While K4o is not a premium hand, it does contain a King, which can hit top pair. However, the 4-kicker makes it vulnerable. Player 0 has been aggressive from the SB, often stealing blinds. Calling 30 more chips to see a flop with K4o is borderline. However, with Player 0's aggressive tendencies from the SB, and the fact that we're getting 50 chips in the pot for 30 more, the pot odds are somewhat favorable. Folding is an option to preserve chips, especially if we suspect Player 0 has a stronger King. Raising is not advisable with this hand. Given the history of Player 0 stealing, a call might be warranted to see if we can hit something cheap, or if they continue to bet wildly on the flop.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 30.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [4\u2666, A\u2660, 6\u2665]\nP0 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 940.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2663, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Evaluating:\n\n- Hole cards: K\u2663 6\u2660 \u2013 no pair, no straight draw, just one over-card and a weak six kicker.\n- Board: 4\u2666 A\u2660 6\u2665 \u2013 we paired the 6 on the flop but it\u2019s bottom pair on an ace-high board with an over-card that beats us.

However, checking behind gives a free card to Player 0, who might have overcards or a better draw. Since Player 0 checked, it means they likely don't have an Ace or a strong pair. We could be ahead with our pair of Fours. Betting allows us to extract value if Player 0 calls with a weaker hand (like a non-connecting high card) or to take down the pot immediately if they fold. Given the board is somewhat coordinated (Ace, Four, Six), and we have the bottom pair, it's a bit of a tricky spot.\n\nConsidering Player 0's previous actions (min-raise from SB, then check on flop), they seem to be trying to control the pot. A small bet might test their resolve or get calls from worse hands that are still floating with overcards. A bet of around 1/2 to 2/3 pot (40-50 chips) seems reasonable.

With J7 offsuit, this hand is at the bottom of a typical calling range, but given we're in the Big Blind and it's a small raise, calling 10 more chips to see a flop is often the correct choice, especially heads-up.

With J7 offsuit, this hand is at the bottom of a typical calling range, but given we're in the Big Blind and it's a small raise, calling 10 more chips to see a flop is often the correct choice, especially heads-up. Folding would often be too tight in the BB with a small raise. Raising is out of the question with this hand.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [9\u2666, J\u2666, 8\u2663]\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 960.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2665, 4\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] [Check]\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1]  Evaluating:\n\n- Your cards: J\u2663 7\u2665.\n- Board: 9\u2666 J\u2666 8\u2663.\n- Your hand: Top pair (Jacks) with a weak kicker (7), and an open-ended straight draw (we need a 10 or a Queen, as 7 is connected to 8, 9, J in a straight, 10 make us a Q-high straight, T makes us a T-high straight). No flush possibilities here.\n- Opponent (Player 0): 1000 chips.\n- Pot: 40 chips.\n\nYou have top pair and a straight draw. This is a strong hand heads-up on this board, definitely worth betting for value and protection. The board has flush draws (diamonds) and many straight possibilities (any T or Q). Betting allows you to build the pot while you are ahead, and deny equity to draws if your opponent has one. A good bet size on a coordinated board like this is often 2/3 to 3/4 of the pot. Let's aim for 30 chips.\n\n[Bet 30]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 30.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 70 | Current bet: 30\nVisible board: [9\u2666, J\u2666, 8\u2663]\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 930.00 chips | bet 30.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2665, 4\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 70 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 990.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 8\u2663, 4\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  Evaluating:\n\n- Your cards: 7\u2666 2\u2663 \u2013 A very weak, unsuited hand. One of the worst starting hands in poker.\n- Position: You are the Small Blind (first to act this round).\n- Pot: 30 chips.\n- Current bet: 20 chips from you as SB.\n- Stack sizes: You have 980 chips, your opponent has 990 chips.\n\nWith such a terrible hand like 7-2 off-suit, the best strategy is almost always to fold, especially when you are out of position and have to put in 20 chips to see the flop. Raising is out of the question, and calling would be burning chips.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 9\u2663, 4\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Evaluating:\n\n- Hole cards: 9\u2663 4\u2663 \u2013 suited, but low and gapped; only marginally better than absolute junk.\n- Position: Small Blind, first to act.\n- Pot: 30 chips, my SB 20 is already in.\n- Effective stacks: ~1,000 each.\n- Opponent has folded every blind battle so far, which could indicate either tightness or a mediocre range that doesn\u2019t like the stakes. There\u2019s no showdown yet, so the sample is small.\n\nI want to build pots with value and steal uncontested ones with trash. 94s is still trash\u2014it plays poorly post-flop without strong showdown or bluffing equity. It\u2019s too loose to open-raise first in from SB; better to take the 10-chip loss and minimize variance.\n\n[Fold]\n Player 0 folds.\n Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre-flop =====\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 990.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2663, J\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  Evaluating:\n\n- Your cards: Q\u2665 6\u2660 \u2013 A mediocre hand, generally not strong enough for a raise from the small blind. The Queen is decent, but the 6-kicker reduces its value significantly. Unsuited.\n- Position: You are the Small Blind (first to act this round).\n- Pot: 30 chips.\n- Current bet: 20 chips from you as SB.\n- Stack sizes: You have 980 chips, your opponent has 990 chips.\n\nSimilar to the 7-2 off-suit hand in Hand 3, being in the Small Blind with an unsuited, mediocre hand like Q6 off-suit implies that folding is often the best option. You are out of position for the rest of the hand, and your hand doesn't have enough equity to justify a raise or a call for 20 chips. It's better to preserve chips and wait for a stronger hand or better position.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2663, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Evaluating:\n\n- Hole cards: K\u2663 6\u2660 \u2013 offsuit King with a poor kicker; strong enough to open once in a while as a steal against a tight opponent, but only marginally profitable.\n- Position: I am the Small Blind, first to act.\n- Pot: 30 chips (10 BB + 20 SB).\n- Effective stacks: ~1000 each.\n- Opponent has folded to the SB three straight hands (Hands 3, 4, 5), showing strong preference for tight 3-handed value ranges. This increases fold-equity for pure steals.\n\nConsidering the meta:\n\u2013 High fold frequency from P1 in the BB (\u223c75 % so far).  \n\u2013 Our hand blocks some of their continuing range (Kings).  \n\u2013 Frequency balance: we need some King-high / King-blocker steals to balance value opens.\n\nA reasonable play here is to min-raise to 20 (total 40 chips), risking 20 to win 30. Heads-up, that needs only ~40 % fold equity, and an opponent who folds 75 % gives us an immediate profit even when we\u2019re behind when called.\n\n[Raise 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[Player 1]  Evaluating:\n\n- Your cards: K\u2666 4\u2665 \u2013 A King-high hand with a weak kicker, unsuited. Better than some earlier hands, but still relatively weak.\n- Position: You are the Big Blind (last to act this round), and also the Dealer.\n- Pot: 50 chips.\n- Current bet: Player 0 (SB) raised to 40.\n- It's 30 more to call (you already have 10 in the big blind).\n- Stack sizes: You have 970 chips, your opponent has 980 chips.\n\nPlayer 0 opened for a min-raise from the Small Blind (40 chips total). While K4o is not a premium hand, it does contain a King, which can hit top pair. However, the 4-kicker makes it vulnerable. Player 0 has been aggressive from the SB, often stealing blinds. Calling 30 more chips to see a flop with K4o is borderline. However, with Player 0's aggressive tendencies from the SB, and the fact that we're getting 50 chips in the pot for 30 more, the pot odds are somewhat favorable. Folding is an option to preserve chips, especially if we suspect Player 0 has a stronger King. Raising is not advisable with this hand. Given the history of Player 0 stealing, a call might be warranted to see if we can hit something cheap, or if they continue to bet wildly on the flop.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 30.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [4\u2666, A\u2660, 6\u2665]\nP0 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 940.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2663, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Evaluating:\n\n- Hole cards: K\u2663 6\u2660 \u2013 no pair, no straight draw, just one over-card and a weak six kicker.\n- Board: 4\u2666 A\u2660 6\u2665 \u2013 we paired the 6 on the flop but it\u2019s bottom pair on an ace-high board with an over-card that beats us. Villain has called the pre-flop raise and now acts behind us, so his range includes any ace, any pair above sixes, and any two-broadway hands.\n- Pot: 80 chips.\n- Position: I\u2019m out of position (Small Blind) for the rest of the hand.\n- Stack sizes: ~980 for me, ~940 for villain.\n\nBottom pair is marginal at best. Checking keeps the pot small and avoids bloating with a likely out-kicked holding. Continuation betting is not ideal here since I have little showdown value and a board that strongly hits a standard calling range from the big blind (ace-high, 6x+, pocket pairs). I\u2019ll take the free card and re-evaluate turn.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1]  Evaluating:\n\n- Your cards: K\u2666 4\u2665.\n- Board: 4\u2666 A\u2660 6\u2665.\n- Your hand: Bottom pair (Fours). Not a very strong hand, but we might be ahead if Player 0 has nothing.\n- Opponent (Player 0): 980 chips.\n- Pot: 80 chips.\n- Player 0 checked on the flop, which indicates weakness, a desire to pot control, or a trap.\n\nWith bottom pair and no draw, betting here can be risky. However, checking behind gives a free card to Player 0, who might have overcards or a better draw. Since Player 0 checked, it means they likely don't have an Ace or a strong pair. We could be ahead with our pair of Fours. Betting allows us to extract value if Player 0 calls with a weaker hand (like a non-connecting high card) or to take down the pot immediately if they fold. Given the board is somewhat coordinated (Ace, Four, Six), and we have the bottom pair, it's a bit of a tricky spot.\n\nConsidering Player 0's previous actions (min-raise from SB, then check on flop), they seem to be trying to control the pot. A small bet might test their resolve or get calls from worse hands that are still floating with overcards. A bet of around 1/2 to 2/3 pot (40-50 chips) seems reasonable. Given our hand is weak, we want to keep the pot small if called. Let's try 40.\n\n[Bet 40]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [4\u2666, A\u2660, 6\u2665]\nP0 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 900.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2663, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Evaluating:\n\n- My hand: K\u2663 6\u2660 \u2192 I have exactly 3rd pair (the six) on an ace-high board.  \n- Board texture: A-4-6 rainbow; low coordinated but no flush draws.  \n- Villain range after calling 30 pre-flop: any ace, all 4-x, 6-x, and pocket pairs. He realistically has me out-kicked with anything six or higher (A6, A4, T6, 76 etc.) and may hold two pair (A4, 46) or a set.  \n- Pot: 120 chips.  \n- Price to call: 40 chips into a 120 pot \u2192 3-to-1.  \n- Outs: Only the two remaining sixes give me trips; any other card is poor. Any king is just one over-card and still vulnerable.  \n- Position: I am out of position; if I call here and he continues on the turn, I must play additional streets with a weak holding.  \n- Fold equity: My hand has too little equity vs. any continuation range; raising as a bluff is spewing chips.  \n\nConclusion: I\u2019m almost certainly way behind and have little chance to improve. Folding avoids further bleeding.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2666, A\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  Evaluating:\n\n- Your cards: 6\u2666 8\u2663 \u2013 A low, unsuited, unconnected hand.

It has almost no showdown value and minimal potential to hit a strong draw.

The Queen is decent, but the 6-kicker reduces its value significantly.

You are out of position for the rest of the hand, and your hand doesn't have enough equity to justify a raise or a call for 20 chips. It's better to preserve chips and wait for a stronger hand or better position.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2666, 4\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Evaluating:\n\n- Hole cards: K\u2663 6\u2660 \u2013 offsuit King with a poor kicker; strong enough to open once in a while as a steal against a tight opponent, but only marginally profitable.\n- Position: I am the Small Blind, first to act.\n- Pot: 30 chips (10 BB + 20 SB).\n- Effective stacks: ~1000 each.\n- Opponent has folded to the SB three straight hands (Hands 3, 4, 5), showing strong preference for tight 3-handed value ranges. This increases fold-equity for pure steals.\n\nConsidering the meta:\n\u2013 High fold frequency from P1 in the BB (\u223c75 % so far).  \n\u2013 Our hand blocks some of their continuing range (Kings).  \n\u2013 Frequency balance: we need some King-high / King-blocker steals to balance value opens.\n\nA reasonable play here is to min-raise to 20 (total 40 chips), risking 20 to win 30. Heads-up, that needs only ~40 % fold equity, and an opponent who folds 75 % gives us an immediate profit even when we\u2019re behind when called.\n\n[Raise 20]\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 50 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2666, 4\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  Evaluating:\n\n- Your cards: K\u2666 4\u2665 \u2013 A King-high hand with a weak kicker, unsuited. Better than some earlier hands, but still relatively weak.\n- Position: You are the Big Blind (last to act this round), and also the Dealer.\n- Pot: 50 chips.\n- Current bet: Player 0 (SB) raised to 40.\n- It's 30 more to call (you already have 10 in the big blind).\n- Stack sizes: You have 970 chips, your opponent has 980 chips.\n\nPlayer 0 opened for a min-raise from the Small Blind (40 chips total). While K4o is not a premium hand, it does contain a King, which can hit top pair. However, the 4-kicker makes it vulnerable. Player 0 has been aggressive from the SB, often stealing blinds. Calling 30 more chips to see a flop with K4o is borderline. However, with Player 0's aggressive tendencies from the SB, and the fact that we're getting 50 chips in the pot for 30 more, the pot odds are somewhat favorable. Folding is an option to preserve chips, especially if we suspect Player 0 has a stronger King. Raising is not advisable with this hand. Given the history of Player 0 stealing, a call might be warranted to see if we can hit something cheap, or if they continue to bet wildly on the flop.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 30.\n[Player 0]  Evaluating:\n\n- Hole cards: K\u2663 6\u2660 \u2013 no pair, no straight draw, just one over-card and a weak six kicker.\n- Board: 4\u2666 A\u2660 6\u2665 \u2013 we paired the 6 on the flop but it\u2019s bottom pair on an ace-high board with an over-card that beats us. Villain has called the pre-flop raise and now acts behind us, so his range includes any ace, any pair above sixes, and any two-broadway hands.\n- Pot: 80 chips.\n- Position: I\u2019m out of position (Small Blind) for the rest of the hand.\n- Stack sizes: ~980 for me, ~940 for villain.\n\nBottom pair is marginal at best. Checking keeps the pot small and avoids bloating with a likely out-kicked holding. Continuation betting is not ideal here since I have little showdown value and a board that strongly hits a standard calling range from the big blind (ace-high, 6x+, pocket pairs). I\u2019ll take the free card and re-evaluate turn.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [4\u2666, A\u2660, 6\u2665]\nP0 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 940.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2666, 4\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  Evaluating:\n\n- Your cards: K\u2666 4\u2665.\n- Board: 4\u2666 A\u2660 6\u2665.\n- Your hand: Bottom pair (Fours). Not a very strong hand, but we might be ahead if Player 0 has nothing.\n- Opponent (Player 0): 980 chips.\n- Pot: 80 chips.\n- Player 0 checked on the flop, which indicates weakness, a desire to pot control, or a trap.\n\nWith bottom pair and no draw, betting here can be risky. However, checking behind gives a free card to Player 0, who might have overcards or a better draw. Since Player 0 checked, it means they likely don't have an Ace or a strong pair. We could be ahead with our pair of Fours. Betting allows us to extract value if Player 0 calls with a weaker hand (like a non-connecting high card) or to take down the pot immediately if they fold. Given the board is somewhat coordinated (Ace, Four, Six), and we have the bottom pair, it's a bit of a tricky spot.\n\nConsidering Player 0's previous actions (min-raise from SB, then check on flop), they seem to be trying to control the pot. A small bet might test their resolve or get calls from worse hands that are still floating with overcards. A bet of around 1/2 to 2/3 pot (40-50 chips) seems reasonable. Given our hand is weak, we want to keep the pot small if called. Let's try 40.\n\n[Bet 40]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 40.\n[Player 0]  Evaluating:\n\n- My hand: K\u2663 6\u2660 \u2192 I have exactly 3rd pair (the six) on an ace-high board.  \n- Board texture: A-4-6 rainbow; low coordinated but no flush draws.  \n- Villain range after calling 30 pre-flop: any ace, all 4-x, 6-x, and pocket pairs. He realistically has me out-kicked with anything six or higher (A6, A4, T6, 76 etc.) and may hold two pair (A4, 46) or a set.  \n- Pot: 120 chips.  \n- Price to call: 40 chips into a 120 pot \u2192 3-to-1.  \n- Outs: Only the two remaining sixes give me trips; any other card is poor. Any king is just one over-card and still vulnerable.  \n- Position: I am out of position; if I call here and he continues on the turn, I must play additional streets with a weak holding.  \n- Fold equity: My hand has too little equity vs. any continuation range; raising as a bluff is spewing chips.  \n\nConclusion: I\u2019m almost certainly way behind and have little chance to improve. Folding avoids further bleeding.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, 8\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  Evaluating:\n\n- Your cards: 6\u2666 8\u2663 \u2013 A low, unsuited, unconnected hand. Generally a very weak hand in heads-up play.\n- Position: You are the Small Blind (first to act this round).\n- Pot: 30 chips.\n- Current bet: 20 chips from you as SB.\n- Stack sizes: You have 1000 chips, your opponent has 970 chips.\n\nSimilar to previous bad hands in the Small Blind, 8-6 off-suit is not a playable hand for raising or calling, especially when out of position for the rest of the hand. It has almost no showdown value and minimal potential to hit a strong draw. Folding is the standard correct play here to preserve chips and avoid putting more money into a pot with a very weak hand.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 990.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 9\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   \nHole cards: J\u2660 3\u2666 \u2013 unsuited junk, one broadway card but dominated by every better jack, no flush or straight potential.  \nPosition: Small Blind, first to act.  \nPot: 30 chips (10/20 blinds).  \nStack: 980 effective.\n\nAgainst a competent opponent who has so far folded to SB steals only a little, J3o is a clear fold.

Better than some earlier hands, but still relatively weak.\n- Position: You are the Big Blind (last to act this round), and also the Dealer.\n- Pot: 50 chips.\n- Current bet: Player 0 (SB) raised to 40.\n- It's 30 more to call (you already have 10 in the big blind).\n- Stack sizes: You have 970 chips, your opponent has 980 chips.\n\nPlayer 0 opened for a min-raise from the Small Blind (40 chips total). While K4o is not a premium hand, it does contain a King, which can hit top pair. However, the 4-kicker makes it vulnerable. Player 0 has been aggressive from the SB, often stealing blinds. Calling 30 more chips to see a flop with K4o is borderline. However, with Player 0's aggressive tendencies from the SB, and the fact that we're getting 50 chips in the pot for 30 more, the pot odds are somewhat favorable. Folding is an option to preserve chips, especially if we suspect Player 0 has a stronger King. Raising is not advisable with this hand. Given the history of Player 0 stealing, a call might be warranted to see if we can hit something cheap, or if they continue to bet wildly on the flop.\n\n[Call]\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 30.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [4\u2666, A\u2660, 6\u2665]\nP0 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 940.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2663, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Evaluating:\n\n- Hole cards: K\u2663 6\u2660 \u2013 no pair, no straight draw, just one over-card and a weak six kicker.\n- Board: 4\u2666 A\u2660 6\u2665 \u2013 we paired the 6 on the flop but it\u2019s bottom pair on an ace-high board with an over-card that beats us. Villain has called the pre-flop raise and now acts behind us, so his range includes any ace, any pair above sixes, and any two-broadway hands.\n- Pot: 80 chips.\n- Position: I\u2019m out of position (Small Blind) for the rest of the hand.\n- Stack sizes: ~980 for me, ~940 for villain.\n\nBottom pair is marginal at best. Checking keeps the pot small and avoids bloating with a likely out-kicked holding. Continuation betting is not ideal here since I have little showdown value and a board that strongly hits a standard calling range from the big blind (ace-high, 6x+, pocket pairs). I\u2019ll take the free card and re-evaluate turn.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1]  Evaluating:\n\n- Your cards: K\u2666 4\u2665.\n- Board: 4\u2666 A\u2660 6\u2665.\n- Your hand: Bottom pair (Fours). Not a very strong hand, but we might be ahead if Player 0 has nothing.\n- Opponent (Player 0): 980 chips.\n- Pot: 80 chips.\n- Player 0 checked on the flop, which indicates weakness, a desire to pot control, or a trap.\n\nWith bottom pair and no draw, betting here can be risky. However, checking behind gives a free card to Player 0, who might have overcards or a better draw. Since Player 0 checked, it means they likely don't have an Ace or a strong pair. We could be ahead with our pair of Fours. Betting allows us to extract value if Player 0 calls with a weaker hand (like a non-connecting high card) or to take down the pot immediately if they fold. Given the board is somewhat coordinated (Ace, Four, Six), and we have the bottom pair, it's a bit of a tricky spot.\n\nConsidering Player 0's previous actions (min-raise from SB, then check on flop), they seem to be trying to control the pot. A small bet might test their resolve or get calls from worse hands that are still floating with overcards. A bet of around 1/2 to 2/3 pot (40-50 chips) seems reasonable. Given our hand is weak, we want to keep the pot small if called. Let's try 40.\n\n[Bet 40]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [4\u2666, A\u2660, 6\u2665]\nP0 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 900.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2663, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  Evaluating:\n\n- My hand: K\u2663 6\u2660 \u2192 I have exactly 3rd pair (the six) on an ace-high board.  \n- Board texture: A-4-6 rainbow; low coordinated but no flush draws.  \n- Villain range after calling 30 pre-flop: any ace, all 4-x, 6-x, and pocket pairs. He realistically has me out-kicked with anything six or higher (A6, A4, T6, 76 etc.) and may hold two pair (A4, 46) or a set.  \n- Pot: 120 chips.  \n- Price to call: 40 chips into a 120 pot \u2192 3-to-1.  \n- Outs: Only the two remaining sixes give me trips; any other card is poor. Any king is just one over-card and still vulnerable.  \n- Position: I am out of position; if I call here and he continues on the turn, I must play additional streets with a weak holding.  \n- Fold equity: My hand has too little equity vs. any continuation range; raising as a bluff is spewing chips.  \n\nConclusion: I\u2019m almost certainly way behind and have little chance to improve. Folding avoids further bleeding.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 970.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1000.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2666, A\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  Evaluating:\n\n- Your cards: 6\u2666 8\u2663 \u2013 A low, unsuited, unconnected hand.
