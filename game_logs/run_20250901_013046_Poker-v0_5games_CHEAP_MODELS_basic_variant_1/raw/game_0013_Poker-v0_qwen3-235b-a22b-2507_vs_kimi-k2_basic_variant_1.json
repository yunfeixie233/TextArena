Against a single opponent, 3-betting as the Big Blind is usually a strong play, especially since the pot is already 30 chips. Against a limp, a half-pot raise is about 30 chips (bringing the total to 50), but a smaller raise like 20 can still fold out random hands that missed. Given the small sample and aggressive small-ball style, I\u2019ll make a concise raise and be willing to continue on good boards.  \n\n[Raise 40]\n[GAME] Player 1 raises to 60.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 60\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 60.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2666, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 80 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 960.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1010.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 8\u2666, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1000.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 8\u2666, 6\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  [Fold]\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 960.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1010.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 2\u2665, 8\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 1]  Q\u2660 T\u2666 is a very playable hand heads-up\u2014above-average strength and the Big Blind showed he will fold to 3-bets last time.

The pot would cost me 50 chips to continue, which is almost 5% of my remaining stack, and the implied odds are crippling because flops without a 9 (96%) leave me drawing dead.
