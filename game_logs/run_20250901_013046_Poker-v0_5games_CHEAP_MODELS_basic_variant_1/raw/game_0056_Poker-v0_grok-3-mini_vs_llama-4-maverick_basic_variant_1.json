The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check.

They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands.

Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack.

You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================",

In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2660, 4\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements. This approach balances aggression with caution in the early stages of the tournament, preserving chips while staying in the game.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================",

They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1020.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================",

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2660, 4\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice. This conserves your stack for better opportunities in subsequent hands without chasing a likely unprofitable pot.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1020.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1020\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2660, 10\u2660, which is a suited connector. This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements. This approach balances aggression with caution in the early stages of the tournament, preserving chips while staying in the game.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1040 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is K\u2665, 2\u2665, which is a weak hand due to the low value of the 2 and the lack of a strong connection between the cards. Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand. This amount is roughly half the pot, which is a standard sizing to encourage calls from marginal hands without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 20 chips is `[Bet 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 910.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================",

The board also features a potential flush draw with two spades.\n   - Your hand, K\u2665, 2\u2665, has improved to a pair of Kings, but the kicker is weak.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1020.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand.

The board also features a potential flush draw with two spades.\n   - Your hand, K\u2665, 2\u2665, has improved to a pair of Kings, but the kicker is weak.

It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2660, 4\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice. This conserves your stack for better opportunities in subsequent hands without chasing a likely unprofitable pot.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1020.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1020\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2660, 10\u2660, which is a suited connector. This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements. This approach balances aggression with caution in the early stages of the tournament, preserving chips while staying in the game.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1040 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is K\u2665, 2\u2665, which is a weak hand due to the low value of the 2 and the lack of a strong connection between the cards. Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand.

The flop had a potential heart flush draw, and the Ace could have paired one of the players' hands. The7\u2660 on the turn doesn't directly help your hand but adds to the board's texture.\n - Your hand is6\u2666, K\u2660. While you don't have a strong hand yet, you have a backdoor flush draw with the6\u2666 and the presence of diamonds on the board (though only one diamond is currently visible). However, the more relevant factor is that the board hasn't directly connected with your hand.\n - The current bet is0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n - Your hand isn't strong currently, but checking doesn't commit you to the pot.

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2660, 4\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it.

In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting.

The Ace on the board is a potential threat, as your opponent might have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - You need to decide whether to continue with your hand. Calling the bet allows you to see the river, but it risks facing another bet or a strong hand from your opponent.\n - Folding is a viable option if you believe your opponent has a stronger hand, such as an Ace or two pair. This avoids committing more chips to a potentially losing hand.\n - Raising could be seen as aggressive, but it might be too risky with a weak kicker.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================",

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand. This amount is roughly half the pot, which is a standard sizing to encourage calls from marginal hands without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 20 chips is `[Bet 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1030\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], which has paired your King (K\u2665), giving you a top pair with a weak kicker (2\u2665). The board also features a potential flush draw with two spades.\n   - Your hand, K\u2665, 2\u2665, has improved to a pair of Kings, but the kicker is weak. The Ace on the board could have paired your opponent's hand, potentially giving them a stronger hand.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to build the pot. Given the Ace on the board, it's possible they have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - You need to consider the strength of your hand and the potential range of your opponent. With a top pair and a weak kicker, your hand is vulnerable to being outkicked or facing a stronger hand.\n   - Calling the bet allows you to see the next card and assess the situation further. Folding might be too cautious if you believe your opponent is bluffing or semi-bluffing, but it's a viable option if you think their range is strong.\n   - Raising could be seen as aggressive and might put pressure on your opponent, but it also risks committing more chips with a potentially dominated hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws. A bet of 40 chips (about half the pot) is a balanced sizing that encourages calls from hands worse than yours without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:4/10\n - Phase: Turn\n - Board: [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666]\n - Pot:120 chips\n - Current bet:40 chips\n - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n - Your hole cards: K\u2665,2\u2665\n - Your chips:1010\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - The turn card is [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666], and your hand is K\u2665,2\u2665, giving you a pair of Kings.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice. This conserves your stack for better opportunities in subsequent hands without chasing a likely unprofitable pot.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1020.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1020\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2660, 10\u2660, which is a suited connector. This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand. This amount is roughly half the pot, which is a standard sizing to encourage calls from marginal hands without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 20 chips is `[Bet 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 910.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1030\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], which has paired your King (K\u2665), giving you a top pair with a weak kicker (2\u2665). The board also features a potential flush draw with two spades.\n   - Your hand, K\u2665, 2\u2665, has improved to a pair of Kings, but the kicker is weak. The Ace on the board could have paired your opponent's hand, potentially giving them a stronger hand.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to build the pot. Given the Ace on the board, it's possible they have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - You need to consider the strength of your hand and the potential range of your opponent. With a top pair and a weak kicker, your hand is vulnerable to being outkicked or facing a stronger hand.\n   - Calling the bet allows you to see the next card and assess the situation further. Folding might be too cautious if you believe your opponent is bluffing or semi-bluffing, but it's a viable option if you think their range is strong.\n   - Raising could be seen as aggressive and might put pressure on your opponent, but it also risks committing more chips with a potentially dominated hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws.

You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand.

The flop had a potential heart flush draw, and the Ace could have paired one of the players' hands. The7\u2660 on the turn doesn't directly help your hand but adds to the board's texture.\n - Your hand is6\u2666, K\u2660. While you don't have a strong hand yet, you have a backdoor flush draw with the6\u2666 and the presence of diamonds on the board (though only one diamond is currently visible). However, the more relevant factor is that the board hasn't directly connected with your hand.\n - The current bet is0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n - Your hand isn't strong currently, but checking doesn't commit you to the pot.

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2660, 4\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it.

In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting.

The Ace on the board is a potential threat, as your opponent might have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - You need to decide whether to continue with your hand. Calling the bet allows you to see the river, but it risks facing another bet or a strong hand from your opponent.\n - Folding is a viable option if you believe your opponent has a stronger hand, such as an Ace or two pair. This avoids committing more chips to a potentially losing hand.\n - Raising could be seen as aggressive, but it might be too risky with a weak kicker.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, which is a suited connector. This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 980 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, is a premium starting hand (Ace-King suited), with high potential for strong post-flop plays, including pairs, straights, or flushes. In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes.

You need to call an additional 20 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are 60 (pot) to 20 (additional call), or 3:1, which is favorable.

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2660, 4\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice. This conserves your stack for better opportunities in subsequent hands without chasing a likely unprofitable pot.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1020.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1020\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2660, 10\u2660, which is a suited connector. This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements. This approach balances aggression with caution in the early stages of the tournament, preserving chips while staying in the game.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1040 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is K\u2665, 2\u2665, which is a weak hand due to the low value of the 2 and the lack of a strong connection between the cards. Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand. This amount is roughly half the pot, which is a standard sizing to encourage calls from marginal hands without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 20 chips is `[Bet 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 910.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1030\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], which has paired your King (K\u2665), giving you a top pair with a weak kicker (2\u2665). The board also features a potential flush draw with two spades.\n   - Your hand, K\u2665, 2\u2665, has improved to a pair of Kings, but the kicker is weak. The Ace on the board could have paired your opponent's hand, potentially giving them a stronger hand.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to build the pot. Given the Ace on the board, it's possible they have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - You need to consider the strength of your hand and the potential range of your opponent. With a top pair and a weak kicker, your hand is vulnerable to being outkicked or facing a stronger hand.\n   - Calling the bet allows you to see the next card and assess the situation further. Folding might be too cautious if you believe your opponent is bluffing or semi-bluffing, but it's a viable option if you think their range is strong.\n   - Raising could be seen as aggressive and might put pressure on your opponent, but it also risks committing more chips with a potentially dominated hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws. A bet of 40 chips (about half the pot) is a balanced sizing that encourages calls from hands worse than yours without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660, 9\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 870.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:4/10\n - Phase: Turn\n - Board: [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666]\n - Pot:120 chips\n - Current bet:40 chips\n - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n - Your hole cards: K\u2665,2\u2665\n - Your chips:1010\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - The turn card is [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666], and your hand is K\u2665,2\u2665, giving you a pair of Kings.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand.

Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand.

A bet of 40 chips (about half the pot) is a balanced sizing that encourages calls from hands worse than yours without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:4/10\n - Phase: Turn\n - Board: [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666]\n - Pot:120 chips\n - Current bet:40 chips\n - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n - Your hole cards: K\u2665,2\u2665\n - Your chips:1010\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - The turn card is [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666], and your hand is K\u2665,2\u2665, giving you a pair of Kings. The board has an Ace and a King, and your kicker is weak (2\u2665).\n - The Small Blind has bet40 chips on the turn, suggesting they have a strong hand, likely an Ace or possibly a draw that turned into a strong hand. They might be trying to build the pot or protect their hand.\n - You have a top pair with a weak kicker. The Ace on the board is a potential threat, as your opponent might have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - You need to decide whether to continue with your hand. Calling the bet allows you to see the river, but it risks facing another bet or a strong hand from your opponent.\n - Folding is a viable option if you believe your opponent has a stronger hand, such as an Ace or two pair. This avoids committing more chips to a potentially losing hand.\n - Raising could be seen as aggressive, but it might be too risky with a weak kicker.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, which is a suited connector. This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 980 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, is a premium starting hand (Ace-King suited), with high potential for strong post-flop plays, including pairs, straights, or flushes. In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes. While it's a playable hand, the raise by the Big Blind indicates they have a strong hand.\n   - The current bet is 40 chips, and you've already contributed 20 chips. You need to call an additional 20 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are 60 (pot) to 20 (additional call), or 3:1, which is favorable. However, the Big Blind's raise suggests they have a strong hand, potentially making your suited connector less appealing.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Calling the raise with a suited connector like 7\u2660, 6\u2660 is a viable option due to the favorable pot odds and the potential for making a strong hand post-flop. However, be prepared for a possible continuation bet (CBet) from the Big Blind on the flop.\n   - Folding is also a reasonable option if you believe the Big Blind has a very strong hand, as indicated by their raise.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy. It allows you to build the pot and apply pressure.

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it.

In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand.

You have a pair of sevens, which is a strong hand on this flop.\n   - The presence of two diamonds on the board indicates a possible diamond flush draw for opponents, but you don't have a diamond.\n   - With no current bet, checking is a valid action to see how the hand develops.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is a safe play to proceed to the next round without committing additional chips.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], which includes two diamonds, indicating a potential diamond flush draw. Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy. It allows you to build the pot and apply pressure. A bet of around half the pot (40 chips) is a reasonable sizing to achieve this.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], which is a low-textured board with no pairs and two diamonds, potentially indicating diamond flush draws for opponents. Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 910.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================",

There's a potential for a heart flush draw, and the Ace could have paired one of the players' hands.\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660, which doesn't directly connect with the board but has some potential for a straight draw if more cards are considered (though not directly with the current flop).\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n   - Your hand isn't strong currently, and checking doesn't commit you to the pot.

You have a diamond, matching the 5\u2666, but that's a weak flush draw at best.\n   - With no current bet, this is a good opportunity to check and avoid committing chips, allowing you to evaluate the turn card without risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the safest play here, as it keeps you in the hand passively and conserves chips for a potentially stronger position later.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:1/10\n - Board: [5\u2666,3\u2665, A\u2665,7\u2660]\n - Pot:40 chips\n - Current bet:0 chips\n - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n - Your hole cards:6\u2666, K\u2660\n - Your chips:980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - The turn card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666,3\u2665, A\u2665,7\u2660]. The flop had a potential heart flush draw, and the Ace could have paired one of the players' hands. The7\u2660 on the turn doesn't directly help your hand but adds to the board's texture.\n - Your hand is6\u2666, K\u2660. While you don't have a strong hand yet, you have a backdoor flush draw with the6\u2666 and the presence of diamonds on the board (though only one diamond is currently visible). However, the more relevant factor is that the board hasn't directly connected with your hand.\n - The current bet is0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n - Your hand isn't strong currently, but checking doesn't commit you to the pot.

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2660, 4\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice. This conserves your stack for better opportunities in subsequent hands without chasing a likely unprofitable pot.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1020.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1020\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2660, 10\u2660, which is a suited connector. This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements. This approach balances aggression with caution in the early stages of the tournament, preserving chips while staying in the game.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1040 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is K\u2665, 2\u2665, which is a weak hand due to the low value of the 2 and the lack of a strong connection between the cards. Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand. This amount is roughly half the pot, which is a standard sizing to encourage calls from marginal hands without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 20 chips is `[Bet 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 910.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1030\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], which has paired your King (K\u2665), giving you a top pair with a weak kicker (2\u2665). The board also features a potential flush draw with two spades.\n   - Your hand, K\u2665, 2\u2665, has improved to a pair of Kings, but the kicker is weak. The Ace on the board could have paired your opponent's hand, potentially giving them a stronger hand.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to build the pot. Given the Ace on the board, it's possible they have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - You need to consider the strength of your hand and the potential range of your opponent. With a top pair and a weak kicker, your hand is vulnerable to being outkicked or facing a stronger hand.\n   - Calling the bet allows you to see the next card and assess the situation further. Folding might be too cautious if you believe your opponent is bluffing or semi-bluffing, but it's a viable option if you think their range is strong.\n   - Raising could be seen as aggressive and might put pressure on your opponent, but it also risks committing more chips with a potentially dominated hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws. A bet of 40 chips (about half the pot) is a balanced sizing that encourages calls from hands worse than yours without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660, 9\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 870.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:4/10\n - Phase: Turn\n - Board: [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666]\n - Pot:120 chips\n - Current bet:40 chips\n - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n - Your hole cards: K\u2665,2\u2665\n - Your chips:1010\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - The turn card is [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666], and your hand is K\u2665,2\u2665, giving you a pair of Kings.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes.

You need to call an additional 20 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are 60 (pot) to 20 (additional call), or 3:1, which is favorable.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand.

There's a potential for a heart flush draw, and the Ace could have paired one of the players' hands.\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660, which doesn't directly connect with the board but has some potential for a straight draw if more cards are considered (though not directly with the current flop).\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n   - Your hand isn't strong currently, and checking doesn't commit you to the pot. You can reassess after the next card.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\nGiven the situation and the available actions, the most appropriate response is to check, as it doesn't commit additional chips and allows you to observe the next card.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665], which includes an Ace (high card potential for opponents) and a heart, possibly indicating flush draws.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, has no immediate connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You have a diamond, matching the 5\u2666, but that's a weak flush draw at best.\n   - With no current bet, this is a good opportunity to check and avoid committing chips, allowing you to evaluate the turn card without risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the safest play here, as it keeps you in the hand passively and conserves chips for a potentially stronger position later.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:1/10\n - Board: [5\u2666,3\u2665, A\u2665,7\u2660]\n - Pot:40 chips\n - Current bet:0 chips\n - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n - Your hole cards:6\u2666, K\u2660\n - Your chips:980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - The turn card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666,3\u2665, A\u2665,7\u2660]. The flop had a potential heart flush draw, and the Ace could have paired one of the players' hands. The7\u2660 on the turn doesn't directly help your hand but adds to the board's texture.\n - Your hand is6\u2666, K\u2660. While you don't have a strong hand yet, you have a backdoor flush draw with the6\u2666 and the presence of diamonds on the board (though only one diamond is currently visible). However, the more relevant factor is that the board hasn't directly connected with your hand.\n - The current bet is0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n - Your hand isn't strong currently, but checking doesn't commit you to the pot.

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice. This conserves your stack for better opportunities in subsequent hands without chasing a likely unprofitable pot.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1020.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1020\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2660, 10\u2660, which is a suited connector. This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1020.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements. This approach balances aggression with caution in the early stages of the tournament, preserving chips while staying in the game.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1040 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is K\u2665, 2\u2665, which is a weak hand due to the low value of the 2 and the lack of a strong connection between the cards. Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand. This amount is roughly half the pot, which is a standard sizing to encourage calls from marginal hands without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 20 chips is `[Bet 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1030\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], which has paired your King (K\u2665), giving you a top pair with a weak kicker (2\u2665). The board also features a potential flush draw with two spades.\n   - Your hand, K\u2665, 2\u2665, has improved to a pair of Kings, but the kicker is weak. The Ace on the board could have paired your opponent's hand, potentially giving them a stronger hand.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to build the pot. Given the Ace on the board, it's possible they have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - You need to consider the strength of your hand and the potential range of your opponent.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws. A bet of 40 chips (about half the pot) is a balanced sizing that encourages calls from hands worse than yours without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:4/10\n - Phase: Turn\n - Board: [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666]\n - Pot:120 chips\n - Current bet:40 chips\n - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n - Your hole cards: K\u2665,2\u2665\n - Your chips:1010\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - The turn card is [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666], and your hand is K\u2665,2\u2665, giving you a pair of Kings. The board has an Ace and a King, and your kicker is weak (2\u2665).\n - The Small Blind has bet40 chips on the turn, suggesting they have a strong hand, likely an Ace or possibly a draw that turned into a strong hand. They might be trying to build the pot or protect their hand.\n - You have a top pair with a weak kicker. The Ace on the board is a potential threat, as your opponent might have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - You need to decide whether to continue with your hand. Calling the bet allows you to see the river, but it risks facing another bet or a strong hand from your opponent.\n - Folding is a viable option if you believe your opponent has a stronger hand, such as an Ace or two pair. This avoids committing more chips to a potentially losing hand.\n - Raising could be seen as aggressive, but it might be too risky with a weak kicker.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, which is a suited connector. This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes. While it's a playable hand, the raise by the Big Blind indicates they have a strong hand.\n   - The current bet is 40 chips, and you've already contributed 20 chips. You need to call an additional 20 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are 60 (pot) to 20 (additional call), or 3:1, which is favorable. However, the Big Blind's raise suggests they have a strong hand, potentially making your suited connector less appealing.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Calling the raise with a suited connector like 7\u2660, 6\u2660 is a viable option due to the favorable pot odds and the potential for making a strong hand post-flop. However, be prepared for a possible continuation bet (CBet) from the Big Blind on the flop.\n   - Folding is also a reasonable option if you believe the Big Blind has a very strong hand, as indicated by their raise.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy. It allows you to build the pot and apply pressure.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660.

The flop had a potential heart flush draw, and the Ace could have paired one of the players' hands. The7\u2660 on the turn doesn't directly help your hand but adds to the board's texture.\n - Your hand is6\u2666, K\u2660. While you don't have a strong hand yet, you have a backdoor flush draw with the6\u2666 and the presence of diamonds on the board (though only one diamond is currently visible). However, the more relevant factor is that the board hasn't directly connected with your hand.\n - The current bet is0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n - Your hand isn't strong currently, but checking doesn't commit you to the pot.

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Calling the bet allows you to see the river, but it risks facing another bet or a strong hand from your opponent.\n - Folding is a viable option if you believe your opponent has a stronger hand, such as an Ace or two pair. This avoids committing more chips to a potentially losing hand.\n - Raising could be seen as aggressive, but it might be too risky with a weak kicker.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, which is a suited connector. This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 980 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, is a premium starting hand (Ace-King suited), with high potential for strong post-flop plays, including pairs, straights, or flushes. In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes. While it's a playable hand, the raise by the Big Blind indicates they have a strong hand.\n   - The current bet is 40 chips, and you've already contributed 20 chips. You need to call an additional 20 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are 60 (pot) to 20 (additional call), or 3:1, which is favorable.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy. It allows you to build the pot and apply pressure.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 910.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660.

A moderate bet (e.g., around half the pot) could be appropriate.\n   - Checking is also an option if you want to see the river card for free, but this gives your opponent a chance to improve or check behind with a stronger hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with a chosen amount is `[Bet N]`.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 980 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, is a premium starting hand (Ace-King suited), with high potential for strong post-flop plays, including pairs, straights, or flushes. In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes. While it's a playable hand, the raise by the Big Blind indicates they have a strong hand.\n   - The current bet is 40 chips, and you've already contributed 20 chips. You need to call an additional 20 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are 60 (pot) to 20 (additional call), or 3:1, which is favorable. However, the Big Blind's raise suggests they have a strong hand, potentially making your suited connector less appealing.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Calling the raise with a suited connector like 7\u2660, 6\u2660 is a viable option due to the favorable pot odds and the potential for making a strong hand post-flop. However, be prepared for a possible continuation bet (CBet) from the Big Blind on the flop.\n   - Folding is also a reasonable option if you believe the Big Blind has a very strong hand, as indicated by their raise.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy. It allows you to build the pot and apply pressure. A bet of around half the pot (40 chips) is a reasonable sizing to achieve this.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], which is a low-textured board with no pairs and two diamonds, potentially indicating diamond flush draws for opponents. Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660.

You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't changed significantly for your hand, as the Q\u2663 doesn't directly affect your pair of sevens. However, it's worth noting that the board still has two diamonds, indicating a possible flush draw for your opponent.\n   - Your opponent checked on the turn, which could indicate a variety of hand strengths, from weakness to a strong hand waiting to trap.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your hand is still relatively strong and the pot is significant, you should consider betting to build the pot or protect your hand.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 980 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, is a premium starting hand (Ace-King suited), with high potential for strong post-flop plays, including pairs, straights, or flushes. In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes. While it's a playable hand, the raise by the Big Blind indicates they have a strong hand.\n   - The current bet is 40 chips, and you've already contributed 20 chips. You need to call an additional 20 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are 60 (pot) to 20 (additional call), or 3:1, which is favorable. However, the Big Blind's raise suggests they have a strong hand, potentially making your suited connector less appealing.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Calling the raise with a suited connector like 7\u2660, 6\u2660 is a viable option due to the favorable pot odds and the potential for making a strong hand post-flop. However, be prepared for a possible continuation bet (CBet) from the Big Blind on the flop.\n   - Folding is also a reasonable option if you believe the Big Blind has a very strong hand, as indicated by their raise.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy. It allows you to build the pot and apply pressure. A bet of around half the pot (40 chips) is a reasonable sizing to achieve this.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], which is a low-textured board with no pairs and two diamonds, potentially indicating diamond flush draws for opponents. Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660. You have a pair of sevens, which is a strong hand on this flop.\n   - The Big Blind has bet 40 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to build the pot.

Calling the bet allows you to see the next card and reassess the situation.\n   - Folding might be too cautious if you believe your opponent is bluffing or semi-bluffing, but it's a viable option if you think their range is strong.\n   - Raising could be seen as aggressive and might be too risky with a hand that, while strong, could be vulnerable to draws or stronger hands.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.

You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't changed significantly for your hand, as the Q\u2663 doesn't directly affect your pair of sevens. However, it's worth noting that the board still has two diamonds, indicating a possible flush draw for your opponent.\n   - Your opponent checked on the turn, which could indicate a variety of hand strengths, from weakness to a strong hand waiting to trap.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your hand is still relatively strong and the pot is significant, you should consider betting to build the pot or protect your hand. A moderate bet (e.g., around half the pot) could be appropriate.\n   - Checking is also an option if you want to see the river card for free, but this gives your opponent a chance to improve or check behind with a stronger hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with a chosen amount is `[Bet N]`.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play.

In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand.

This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further.

The flop had a potential heart flush draw, and the Ace could have paired one of the players' hands. The7\u2660 on the turn doesn't directly help your hand but adds to the board's texture.\n - Your hand is6\u2666, K\u2660. While you don't have a strong hand yet, you have a backdoor flush draw with the6\u2666 and the presence of diamonds on the board (though only one diamond is currently visible). However, the more relevant factor is that the board hasn't directly connected with your hand.\n - The current bet is0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n - Your hand isn't strong currently, but checking doesn't commit you to the pot.

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2660, 4\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it.

In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting.

The Ace on the board is a potential threat, as your opponent might have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - You need to decide whether to continue with your hand. Calling the bet allows you to see the river, but it risks facing another bet or a strong hand from your opponent.\n - Folding is a viable option if you believe your opponent has a stronger hand, such as an Ace or two pair. This avoids committing more chips to a potentially losing hand.\n - Raising could be seen as aggressive, but it might be too risky with a weak kicker.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, which is a suited connector. This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes.

You need to call an additional 20 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are 60 (pot) to 20 (additional call), or 3:1, which is favorable. However, the Big Blind's raise suggests they have a strong hand, potentially making your suited connector less appealing.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Calling the raise with a suited connector like 7\u2660, 6\u2660 is a viable option due to the favorable pot odds and the potential for making a strong hand post-flop. However, be prepared for a possible continuation bet (CBet) from the Big Blind on the flop.\n   - Folding is also a reasonable option if you believe the Big Blind has a very strong hand, as indicated by their raise.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy. It allows you to build the pot and apply pressure. A bet of around half the pot (40 chips) is a reasonable sizing to achieve this.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], which is a low-textured board with no pairs and two diamonds, potentially indicating diamond flush draws for opponents. Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 910.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660.

A moderate bet (e.g., around half the pot) could be appropriate.\n   - Checking is also an option if you want to see the river card for free, but this gives your opponent a chance to improve or check behind with a stronger hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with a chosen amount is `[Bet N]`.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

Your opponent checked, which could mean they are checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a stronger one.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play.

In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further.

There's a potential for a heart flush draw, and the Ace could have paired one of the players' hands.\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660, which doesn't directly connect with the board but has some potential for a straight draw if more cards are considered (though not directly with the current flop).\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n   - Your hand isn't strong currently, and checking doesn't commit you to the pot. You can reassess after the next card.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\nGiven the situation and the available actions, the most appropriate response is to check, as it doesn't commit additional chips and allows you to observe the next card.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665], which includes an Ace (high card potential for opponents) and a heart, possibly indicating flush draws.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, has no immediate connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You have a diamond, matching the 5\u2666, but that's a weak flush draw at best.\n   - With no current bet, this is a good opportunity to check and avoid committing chips, allowing you to evaluate the turn card without risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the safest play here, as it keeps you in the hand passively and conserves chips for a potentially stronger position later.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:1/10\n - Board: [5\u2666,3\u2665, A\u2665,7\u2660]\n - Pot:40 chips\n - Current bet:0 chips\n - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n - Your hole cards:6\u2666, K\u2660\n - Your chips:980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - The turn card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666,3\u2665, A\u2665,7\u2660]. The flop had a potential heart flush draw, and the Ace could have paired one of the players' hands. The7\u2660 on the turn doesn't directly help your hand but adds to the board's texture.\n - Your hand is6\u2666, K\u2660. While you don't have a strong hand yet, you have a backdoor flush draw with the6\u2666 and the presence of diamonds on the board (though only one diamond is currently visible). However, the more relevant factor is that the board hasn't directly connected with your hand.\n - The current bet is0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n - Your hand isn't strong currently, but checking doesn't commit you to the pot.

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice. This conserves your stack for better opportunities in subsequent hands without chasing a likely unprofitable pot.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1020.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1020\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2660, 10\u2660, which is a suited connector. This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1020.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements. This approach balances aggression with caution in the early stages of the tournament, preserving chips while staying in the game.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1040 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is K\u2665, 2\u2665, which is a weak hand due to the low value of the 2 and the lack of a strong connection between the cards. Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand. This amount is roughly half the pot, which is a standard sizing to encourage calls from marginal hands without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 20 chips is `[Bet 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1030\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], which has paired your King (K\u2665), giving you a top pair with a weak kicker (2\u2665). The board also features a potential flush draw with two spades.\n   - Your hand, K\u2665, 2\u2665, has improved to a pair of Kings, but the kicker is weak. The Ace on the board could have paired your opponent's hand, potentially giving them a stronger hand.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to build the pot. Given the Ace on the board, it's possible they have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - You need to consider the strength of your hand and the potential range of your opponent.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws. A bet of 40 chips (about half the pot) is a balanced sizing that encourages calls from hands worse than yours without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:4/10\n - Phase: Turn\n - Board: [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666]\n - Pot:120 chips\n - Current bet:40 chips\n - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n - Your hole cards: K\u2665,2\u2665\n - Your chips:1010\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - The turn card is [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666], and your hand is K\u2665,2\u2665, giving you a pair of Kings. The board has an Ace and a King, and your kicker is weak (2\u2665).\n - The Small Blind has bet40 chips on the turn, suggesting they have a strong hand, likely an Ace or possibly a draw that turned into a strong hand. They might be trying to build the pot or protect their hand.\n - You have a top pair with a weak kicker. The Ace on the board is a potential threat, as your opponent might have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - You need to decide whether to continue with your hand. Calling the bet allows you to see the river, but it risks facing another bet or a strong hand from your opponent.\n - Folding is a viable option if you believe your opponent has a stronger hand, such as an Ace or two pair. This avoids committing more chips to a potentially losing hand.\n - Raising could be seen as aggressive, but it might be too risky with a weak kicker.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, which is a suited connector.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes.

You need to call an additional 20 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are 60 (pot) to 20 (additional call), or 3:1, which is favorable.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal.

In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further. This approach maintains a balanced strategy, preserving chips while staying in the game for potential improvement.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1160 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660, a suited connector. This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a playable starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, which is the amount of the Big Blind. You have already posted 10 chips as the Big Blind, so you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a reasonable action to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the Small Blind's bet is a reasonable action.

This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand. A bet of 40 chips, roughly equal to the pot, balances aggression with risk management in the middle of the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`",

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements. This approach balances aggression with caution in the early stages of the tournament, preserving chips while staying in the game.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1040 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is K\u2665, 2\u2665, which is a weak hand due to the low value of the 2 and the lack of a strong connection between the cards. Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand. This amount is roughly half the pot, which is a standard sizing to encourage calls from marginal hands without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 20 chips is `[Bet 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 910.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1030\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], which has paired your King (K\u2665), giving you a top pair with a weak kicker (2\u2665). The board also features a potential flush draw with two spades.\n   - Your hand, K\u2665, 2\u2665, has improved to a pair of Kings, but the kicker is weak. The Ace on the board could have paired your opponent's hand, potentially giving them a stronger hand.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to build the pot. Given the Ace on the board, it's possible they have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - You need to consider the strength of your hand and the potential range of your opponent. With a top pair and a weak kicker, your hand is vulnerable to being outkicked or facing a stronger hand.\n   - Calling the bet allows you to see the next card and assess the situation further. Folding might be too cautious if you believe your opponent is bluffing or semi-bluffing, but it's a viable option if you think their range is strong.\n   - Raising could be seen as aggressive and might put pressure on your opponent, but it also risks committing more chips with a potentially dominated hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet).

A bet of 80 chips (half the pot) is a reasonable action.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 80]`\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Turn\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663]\n   - Pot: 240 chips\n   - Current bet: 80 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 910\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The board shows [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663], featuring low cards with a Queen high and two diamonds, indicating potential flush draws. Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips. Raising could risk losing more against a strong hand, while folding gives up potential equity in an early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 830.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 850.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 850\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660. You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't improved your hand, and there are no clear indications that you have the best hand. Your opponent checked, which could mean they are checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a stronger one.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (7\u2660, 6\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong hand, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 830\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665] features a mix of suits and ranks, with potential for straights (e.g., J-Q sequence) or flush draws (two diamonds). Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play. It avoids unnecessary risk and lets the hand resolve naturally.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 5:\nPlayer 0: K\u2665 A\u2665\nPlayer 1: 3\u2666 2\u2666\nCommunity cards: 2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 320 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: A\u2660, J\u2665\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, A\u2660 and J\u2665, is a solid starting hand (Ace-Jack offsuit), offering strong high-card potential and the ability to make top pair or better on the flop. In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further. This approach maintains a balanced strategy, preserving chips while staying in the game for potential improvement.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1160 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660, a suited connector. This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a playable starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, which is the amount of the Big Blind. You have already posted 10 chips as the Big Blind, so you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a reasonable action to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the Small Blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: A\u2660, J\u2665\n   - Your chips: 810\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666], which pairs both your hole cards\u2014A\u2660 with the A\u2666 for a pair of Aces and J\u2665 with the J\u2663 for a pair of Jacks\u2014resulting in two pair. This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand. A bet of 40 chips, roughly equal to the pot, balances aggression with risk management in the middle of the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 770.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1150.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================",

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it.

In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand.

You have a pair of sevens, which is a strong hand on this flop.\n   - The presence of two diamonds on the board indicates a possible diamond flush draw for opponents, but you don't have a diamond.\n   - With no current bet, checking is a valid action to see how the hand develops.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is a safe play to proceed to the next round without committing additional chips.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], which includes two diamonds, indicating a potential diamond flush draw. Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy. It allows you to build the pot and apply pressure. A bet of around half the pot (40 chips) is a reasonable sizing to achieve this.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], which is a low-textured board with no pairs and two diamonds, potentially indicating diamond flush draws for opponents. Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 910.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660. You have a pair of sevens, which is a strong hand on this flop.\n   - The Big Blind has bet 40 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to build the pot. Given the presence of two diamonds on the board, they might have a diamond draw or a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - You need to decide whether to continue with your hand. Calling the bet allows you to see the next card and reassess the situation.\n   - Folding might be too cautious if you believe your opponent is bluffing or semi-bluffing, but it's a viable option if you think their range is strong.\n   - Raising could be seen as aggressive and might be too risky with a hand that, while strong, could be vulnerable to draws or stronger hands.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`. This is a reasonable action to see the turn card and reassess.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 160 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 910.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Turn\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663]\n   - Pot: 160 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The turn card is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660. You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't changed significantly for your hand, as the Q\u2663 doesn't directly affect your pair of sevens. However, it's worth noting that the board still has two diamonds, indicating a possible flush draw for your opponent.\n   - Your opponent checked on the turn, which could indicate a variety of hand strengths, from weakness to a strong hand waiting to trap.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your hand is still relatively strong and the pot is significant, you should consider betting to build the pot or protect your hand. A moderate bet (e.g., around half the pot) could be appropriate.\n   - Checking is also an option if you want to see the river card for free, but this gives your opponent a chance to improve or check behind with a stronger hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with a chosen amount is `[Bet N]`. A bet of 80 chips (half the pot) is a reasonable action.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 80]`\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Turn\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663]\n   - Pot: 240 chips\n   - Current bet: 80 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 910\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The board shows [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663], featuring low cards with a Queen high and two diamonds, indicating potential flush draws. Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips. Raising could risk losing more against a strong hand, while folding gives up potential equity in an early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 830.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 850.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 850\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660. You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't improved your hand, and there are no clear indications that you have the best hand. Your opponent checked, which could mean they are checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a stronger one.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (7\u2660, 6\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong hand, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 830\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665] features a mix of suits and ranks, with potential for straights (e.g., J-Q sequence) or flush draws (two diamonds). Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play. It avoids unnecessary risk and lets the hand resolve naturally.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 5:\nPlayer 0: K\u2665 A\u2665\nPlayer 1: 3\u2666 2\u2666\nCommunity cards: 2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 320 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: A\u2660, J\u2665\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, A\u2660 and J\u2665, is a solid starting hand (Ace-Jack offsuit), offering strong high-card potential and the ability to make top pair or better on the flop. In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further. This approach maintains a balanced strategy, preserving chips while staying in the game for potential improvement.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1160 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660, a suited connector. This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a playable starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, which is the amount of the Big Blind. You have already posted 10 chips as the Big Blind, so you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a reasonable action to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the Small Blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: A\u2660, J\u2665\n   - Your chips: 810\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666], which pairs both your hole cards\u2014A\u2660 with the A\u2666 for a pair of Aces and J\u2665 with the J\u2663 for a pair of Jacks\u2014resulting in two pair. This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand. A bet of 40 chips, roughly equal to the pot, balances aggression with risk management in the middle of the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 770.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1150.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1150\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666], and your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand.

Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand.

A bet of 40 chips (about half the pot) is a balanced sizing that encourages calls from hands worse than yours without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:4/10\n - Phase: Turn\n - Board: [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666]\n - Pot:120 chips\n - Current bet:40 chips\n - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n - Your hole cards: K\u2665,2\u2665\n - Your chips:1010\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - The turn card is [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666], and your hand is K\u2665,2\u2665, giving you a pair of Kings.

They might be trying to build the pot or protect their hand.\n - You have a top pair with a weak kicker. The Ace on the board is a potential threat, as your opponent might have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - You need to decide whether to continue with your hand. Calling the bet allows you to see the river, but it risks facing another bet or a strong hand from your opponent.\n - Folding is a viable option if you believe your opponent has a stronger hand, such as an Ace or two pair. This avoids committing more chips to a potentially losing hand.\n - Raising could be seen as aggressive, but it might be too risky with a weak kicker.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, which is a suited connector.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes. While it's a playable hand, the raise by the Big Blind indicates they have a strong hand.\n   - The current bet is 40 chips, and you've already contributed 20 chips. You need to call an additional 20 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are 60 (pot) to 20 (additional call), or 3:1, which is favorable. However, the Big Blind's raise suggests they have a strong hand, potentially making your suited connector less appealing.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Calling the raise with a suited connector like 7\u2660, 6\u2660 is a viable option due to the favorable pot odds and the potential for making a strong hand post-flop.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy. It allows you to build the pot and apply pressure.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play.

In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further.

This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1150.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, J\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: A\u2660, J\u2665\n   - Your chips: 810\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666], which pairs both your hole cards\u2014A\u2660 with the A\u2666 for a pair of Aces and J\u2665 with the J\u2663 for a pair of Jacks\u2014resulting in two pair. This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand. A bet of 40 chips, roughly equal to the pot, balances aggression with risk management in the middle of the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1150\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666], and your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660. You have a potential straight draw with 4 and 5, but it's a weak draw.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 40 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand, such as a pair of Aces or a strong Jack/Queen.\n   - You need to decide whether to continue with your hand. Calling the bet allows you to see the next card, but it risks facing another bet or a strong hand from your opponent.\n   - Folding is a viable option if you believe your opponent has a stronger hand, which is likely given their bet.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 80 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 840.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1130.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 7\u2666, 10\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:7/10\n - Phase: Pre-flop\n - Board: []\n - Pot:30 chips\n - Current bet:20 chips\n - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n - Your hole cards: K\u2663,9\u2665\n - Your chips:1130 (with20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - Your hand is K\u2663,9\u2665, an offsuit King-nine.

The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important. Folding avoids committing more to a marginal hand, while calling could allow you to see the flop cheaply and potentially improve, though it's risky given the hand's weakness.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the low cost to call and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable option to stay in the hand and reassess on the flop. However, if you suspect P1 has a strong range (based on their action), folding could conserve chips for better spots. Here, the marginal hand and pot odds lean toward calling to maintain flexibility.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`",

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it.

You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand.

With a top pair and a weak kicker, your hand is vulnerable to being outkicked or facing a stronger hand.\n   - Calling the bet allows you to see the next card and assess the situation further. Folding might be too cautious if you believe your opponent is bluffing or semi-bluffing, but it's a viable option if you think their range is strong.\n   - Raising could be seen as aggressive and might put pressure on your opponent, but it also risks committing more chips with a potentially dominated hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand.

Calling the bet allows you to see the next card and reassess the situation.\n   - Folding might be too cautious if you believe your opponent is bluffing or semi-bluffing, but it's a viable option if you think their range is strong.\n   - Raising could be seen as aggressive and might be too risky with a hand that, while strong, could be vulnerable to draws or stronger hands.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.

You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't changed significantly for your hand, as the Q\u2663 doesn't directly affect your pair of sevens. However, it's worth noting that the board still has two diamonds, indicating a possible flush draw for your opponent.\n   - Your opponent checked on the turn, which could indicate a variety of hand strengths, from weakness to a strong hand waiting to trap.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your hand is still relatively strong and the pot is significant, you should consider betting to build the pot or protect your hand. A moderate bet (e.g., around half the pot) could be appropriate.\n   - Checking is also an option if you want to see the river card for free, but this gives your opponent a chance to improve or check behind with a stronger hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with a chosen amount is `[Bet N]`. A bet of 80 chips (half the pot) is a reasonable action.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 80]`\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Turn\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663]\n   - Pot: 240 chips\n   - Current bet: 80 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 910\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The board shows [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663], featuring low cards with a Queen high and two diamonds, indicating potential flush draws. Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips. Raising could risk losing more against a strong hand, while folding gives up potential equity in an early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 830.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 850.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 850\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660. You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't improved your hand, and there are no clear indications that you have the best hand. Your opponent checked, which could mean they are checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a stronger one.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (7\u2660, 6\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong hand, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 830\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665] features a mix of suits and ranks, with potential for straights (e.g., J-Q sequence) or flush draws (two diamonds). Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play. It avoids unnecessary risk and lets the hand resolve naturally.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 5:\nPlayer 0: K\u2665 A\u2665\nPlayer 1: 3\u2666 2\u2666\nCommunity cards: 2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 320 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: A\u2660, J\u2665\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, A\u2660 and J\u2665, is a solid starting hand (Ace-Jack offsuit), offering strong high-card potential and the ability to make top pair or better on the flop. In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further. This approach maintains a balanced strategy, preserving chips while staying in the game for potential improvement.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1160 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660, a suited connector. This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a playable starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, which is the amount of the Big Blind. You have already posted 10 chips as the Big Blind, so you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a reasonable action to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the Small Blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: A\u2660, J\u2665\n   - Your chips: 810\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666], which pairs both your hole cards\u2014A\u2660 with the A\u2666 for a pair of Aces and J\u2665 with the J\u2663 for a pair of Jacks\u2014resulting in two pair. This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand. A bet of 40 chips, roughly equal to the pot, balances aggression with risk management in the middle of the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 770.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1150.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1150\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666], and your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660.

The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important. Folding avoids committing more to a marginal hand, while calling could allow you to see the flop cheaply and potentially improve, though it's risky given the hand's weakness.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the low cost to call and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable option to stay in the hand and reassess on the flop. However, if you suspect P1 has a strong range (based on their action), folding could conserve chips for better spots.

The7\u2660 on the turn doesn't directly help your hand but adds to the board's texture.\n - Your hand is6\u2666, K\u2660. While you don't have a strong hand yet, you have a backdoor flush draw with the6\u2666 and the presence of diamonds on the board (though only one diamond is currently visible). However, the more relevant factor is that the board hasn't directly connected with your hand.\n - The current bet is0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n - Your hand isn't strong currently, but checking doesn't commit you to the pot. You can reassess after the next card.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\nGiven the situation and the available actions, the most appropriate response is to check, as it doesn't commit additional chips and allows you to observe the next card.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: Turn\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The board now shows [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660], which includes an Ace (a strong high card that could pair with an opponent's hand) and a mix of suits, potentially indicating flush draws. The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

This avoids committing more chips to a potentially losing hand.\n - Raising could be seen as aggressive, but it might be too risky with a weak kicker.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, which is a suited connector.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes.

You need to call an additional 20 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are 60 (pot) to 20 (additional call), or 3:1, which is favorable.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further.

Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand. A bet of 40 chips, roughly equal to the pot, balances aggression with risk management in the middle of the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1150\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666], and your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660.

You need to call an additional10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n - The pot odds are favorable for calling (pot is30 chips, and you need to call10 more), and in a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - Given the marginal strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable action.

The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important. Folding avoids committing more to a marginal hand, while calling could allow you to see the flop cheaply and potentially improve, though it's risky given the hand's weakness.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the low cost to call and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable option to stay in the hand and reassess on the flop. However, if you suspect P1 has a strong range (based on their action), folding could conserve chips for better spots.

This is a strong draw, especially since you're likely behind at the moment.\n   - With no current bet, checking is a valid action to see how the hand develops, but you could also consider betting to take control of the hand and potentially build the pot.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong flush draw, betting is a viable strategy to apply pressure and potentially build the pot.

Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, has no hearts and doesn't connect with the board in any way\u2014no pairs, straights, or draws\u2014leaving you with just 10 high, which is almost certainly behind any made hand or draw that Player 1 might have.\n   - Player 1's bet of 20 chips indicates strength, as they're likely holding at least a pair, a flush, or a draw that's worth protecting. In a heads-up game, this board texture is dangerous for speculative calls, and your lack of equity makes it unlikely to improve sufficiently on the turn or river.\n   - Pot odds are 60:20 (3:1), which might seem tempting, but your hand has minimal potential against Player 1's apparent strength, making calling a high-risk move with poor expected value. Raising would be overly aggressive with nothing, while folding conserves your dwindling chip stack for better opportunities later in the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the high likelihood that Player 1 has a superior holding, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and maintain your stack, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is key.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`",

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind.

In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws.

You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't changed significantly for your hand, as the Q\u2663 doesn't directly affect your pair of sevens. However, it's worth noting that the board still has two diamonds, indicating a possible flush draw for your opponent.\n   - Your opponent checked on the turn, which could indicate a variety of hand strengths, from weakness to a strong hand waiting to trap.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your hand is still relatively strong and the pot is significant, you should consider betting to build the pot or protect your hand. A moderate bet (e.g., around half the pot) could be appropriate.\n   - Checking is also an option if you want to see the river card for free, but this gives your opponent a chance to improve or check behind with a stronger hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with a chosen amount is `[Bet N]`.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips. Raising could risk losing more against a strong hand, while folding gives up potential equity in an early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 80.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 850\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660. You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't improved your hand, and there are no clear indications that you have the best hand. Your opponent checked, which could mean they are checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a stronger one.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (7\u2660, 6\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong hand, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 830.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 850.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 830\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665] features a mix of suits and ranks, with potential for straights (e.g., J-Q sequence) or flush draws (two diamonds). Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play. It avoids unnecessary risk and lets the hand resolve naturally.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 5:\nPlayer 0: K\u2665 A\u2665\nPlayer 1: 3\u2666 2\u2666\nCommunity cards: 2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 320 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: A\u2660, J\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: A\u2660, J\u2665\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, A\u2660 and J\u2665, is a solid starting hand (Ace-Jack offsuit), offering strong high-card potential and the ability to make top pair or better on the flop. In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further. This approach maintains a balanced strategy, preserving chips while staying in the game for potential improvement.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1160 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660, a suited connector. This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a playable starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, which is the amount of the Big Blind. You have already posted 10 chips as the Big Blind, so you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a reasonable action to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the Small Blind's bet is a reasonable action.

This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand. A bet of 40 chips, roughly equal to the pot, balances aggression with risk management in the middle of the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1150\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666], and your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660.

The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important. Folding avoids committing more to a marginal hand, while calling could allow you to see the flop cheaply and potentially improve, though it's risky given the hand's weakness.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the low cost to call and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable option to stay in the hand and reassess on the flop. However, if you suspect P1 has a strong range (based on their action), folding could conserve chips for better spots.

Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, has no hearts and doesn't connect with the board in any way\u2014no pairs, straights, or draws\u2014leaving you with just 10 high, which is almost certainly behind any made hand or draw that Player 1 might have.\n   - Player 1's bet of 20 chips indicates strength, as they're likely holding at least a pair, a flush, or a draw that's worth protecting. In a heads-up game, this board texture is dangerous for speculative calls, and your lack of equity makes it unlikely to improve sufficiently on the turn or river.\n   - Pot odds are 60:20 (3:1), which might seem tempting, but your hand has minimal potential against Player 1's apparent strength, making calling a high-risk move with poor expected value. Raising would be overly aggressive with nothing, while folding conserves your dwindling chip stack for better opportunities later in the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the high likelihood that Player 1 has a superior holding, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and maintain your stack, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is key.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 60 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2665, 4\u2666\n==============================================",

There's a potential for a heart flush draw, and the Ace could have paired one of the players' hands.\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660, which doesn't directly connect with the board but has some potential for a straight draw if more cards are considered (though not directly with the current flop).\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n   - Your hand isn't strong currently, and checking doesn't commit you to the pot. You can reassess after the next card.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\nGiven the situation and the available actions, the most appropriate response is to check, as it doesn't commit additional chips and allows you to observe the next card.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665], which includes an Ace (high card potential for opponents) and a heart, possibly indicating flush draws.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, has no immediate connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You have a diamond, matching the 5\u2666, but that's a weak flush draw at best.\n   - With no current bet, this is a good opportunity to check and avoid committing chips, allowing you to evaluate the turn card without risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the safest play here, as it keeps you in the hand passively and conserves chips for a potentially stronger position later.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:1/10\n - Board: [5\u2666,3\u2665, A\u2665,7\u2660]\n - Pot:40 chips\n - Current bet:0 chips\n - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n - Your hole cards:6\u2666, K\u2660\n - Your chips:980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - The turn card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666,3\u2665, A\u2665,7\u2660]. The flop had a potential heart flush draw, and the Ace could have paired one of the players' hands. The7\u2660 on the turn doesn't directly help your hand but adds to the board's texture.\n - Your hand is6\u2666, K\u2660. While you don't have a strong hand yet, you have a backdoor flush draw with the6\u2666 and the presence of diamonds on the board (though only one diamond is currently visible). However, the more relevant factor is that the board hasn't directly connected with your hand.\n - The current bet is0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n - Your hand isn't strong currently, but checking doesn't commit you to the pot. You can reassess after the next card.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\nGiven the situation and the available actions, the most appropriate response is to check, as it doesn't commit additional chips and allows you to observe the next card.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: Turn\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The board now shows [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660], which includes an Ace (a strong high card that could pair with an opponent's hand) and a mix of suits, potentially indicating flush draws. The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2660, 4\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice. This conserves your stack for better opportunities in subsequent hands without chasing a likely unprofitable pot.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 3 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1020.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2660, 10\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1020\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2660, 10\u2660, which is a suited connector. This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements. This approach balances aggression with caution in the early stages of the tournament, preserving chips while staying in the game.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1040 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is K\u2665, 2\u2665, which is a weak hand due to the low value of the 2 and the lack of a strong connection between the cards. Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand. This amount is roughly half the pot, which is a standard sizing to encourage calls from marginal hands without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 20 chips is `[Bet 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 910.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1030\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], which has paired your King (K\u2665), giving you a top pair with a weak kicker (2\u2665). The board also features a potential flush draw with two spades.\n   - Your hand, K\u2665, 2\u2665, has improved to a pair of Kings, but the kicker is weak. The Ace on the board could have paired your opponent's hand, potentially giving them a stronger hand.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to build the pot. Given the Ace on the board, it's possible they have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - You need to consider the strength of your hand and the potential range of your opponent. With a top pair and a weak kicker, your hand is vulnerable to being outkicked or facing a stronger hand.\n   - Calling the bet allows you to see the next card and assess the situation further. Folding might be too cautious if you believe your opponent is bluffing or semi-bluffing, but it's a viable option if you think their range is strong.\n   - Raising could be seen as aggressive and might put pressure on your opponent, but it also risks committing more chips with a potentially dominated hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws. A bet of 40 chips (about half the pot) is a balanced sizing that encourages calls from hands worse than yours without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660, 9\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 870.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:4/10\n - Phase: Turn\n - Board: [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666]\n - Pot:120 chips\n - Current bet:40 chips\n - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n - Your hole cards: K\u2665,2\u2665\n - Your chips:1010\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - The turn card is [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666], and your hand is K\u2665,2\u2665, giving you a pair of Kings.

They might be trying to build the pot or protect their hand.\n - You have a top pair with a weak kicker. The Ace on the board is a potential threat, as your opponent might have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - You need to decide whether to continue with your hand. Calling the bet allows you to see the river, but it risks facing another bet or a strong hand from your opponent.\n - Folding is a viable option if you believe your opponent has a stronger hand, such as an Ace or two pair. This avoids committing more chips to a potentially losing hand.\n - Raising could be seen as aggressive, but it might be too risky with a weak kicker.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, which is a suited connector.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play. It avoids unnecessary risk and lets the hand resolve naturally.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 5:\nPlayer 0: K\u2665 A\u2665\nPlayer 1: 3\u2666 2\u2666\nCommunity cards: 2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 320 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: A\u2660, J\u2665\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, A\u2660 and J\u2665, is a solid starting hand (Ace-Jack offsuit), offering strong high-card potential and the ability to make top pair or better on the flop. In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further. This approach maintains a balanced strategy, preserving chips while staying in the game for potential improvement.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1160 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660, a suited connector. This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a playable starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, which is the amount of the Big Blind. You have already posted 10 chips as the Big Blind, so you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a reasonable action to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the Small Blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: A\u2660, J\u2665\n   - Your chips: 810\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666], which pairs both your hole cards\u2014A\u2660 with the A\u2666 for a pair of Aces and J\u2665 with the J\u2663 for a pair of Jacks\u2014resulting in two pair. This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand. A bet of 40 chips, roughly equal to the pot, balances aggression with risk management in the middle of the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 770.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1150.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1150\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666], and your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660. You have a potential straight draw with 4 and 5, but it's a weak draw.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 40 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand, such as a pair of Aces or a strong Jack/Queen.\n   - You need to decide whether to continue with your hand. Calling the bet allows you to see the next card, but it risks facing another bet or a strong hand from your opponent.\n   - Folding is a viable option if you believe your opponent has a stronger hand, which is likely given their bet.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 80 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 840.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1130.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2666, 7\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:7/10\n - Phase: Pre-flop\n - Board: []\n - Pot:30 chips\n - Current bet:20 chips\n - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n - Your hole cards: K\u2663,9\u2665\n - Your chips:1130 (with20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - Your hand is K\u2663,9\u2665, an offsuit King-nine.

This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a hand or fold if the flop doesn't improve your hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 7/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2666, 10\u2663\n   - Your chips: 840 (with 10 already bet as BB, requiring an additional 10 chips to match the current bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, is an offsuit connector with modest potential for improvement (e.g., straight draws), but it's a weak starting hand overall in pre-flop, especially against a possible raise from the Small Blind (P1). The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important. Folding avoids committing more to a marginal hand, while calling could allow you to see the flop cheaply and potentially improve, though it's risky given the hand's weakness.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the low cost to call and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable option to stay in the hand and reassess on the flop. However, if you suspect P1 has a strong range (based on their action), folding could conserve chips for better spots.

This is a strong draw, especially since you're likely behind at the moment.\n   - With no current bet, checking is a valid action to see how the hand develops, but you could also consider betting to take control of the hand and potentially build the pot.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong flush draw, betting is a viable strategy to apply pressure and potentially build the pot.

Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, has no hearts and doesn't connect with the board in any way\u2014no pairs, straights, or draws\u2014leaving you with just 10 high, which is almost certainly behind any made hand or draw that Player 1 might have.\n   - Player 1's bet of 20 chips indicates strength, as they're likely holding at least a pair, a flush, or a draw that's worth protecting. In a heads-up game, this board texture is dangerous for speculative calls, and your lack of equity makes it unlikely to improve sufficiently on the turn or river.\n   - Pot odds are 60:20 (3:1), which might seem tempting, but your hand has minimal potential against Player 1's apparent strength, making calling a high-risk move with poor expected value. Raising would be overly aggressive with nothing, while folding conserves your dwindling chip stack for better opportunities later in the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the high likelihood that Player 1 has a superior holding, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and maintain your stack, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is key.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 60 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2666, 6\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 8/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: Q\u2665, 4\u2666\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, Q\u2665 and 4\u2666, is a weak offsuit combination with a Queen high and a low 4 as a kicker. This starting hand has limited potential for improvement, as it lacks connectivity for straights or flushes and is vulnerable to domination by stronger hands like those with a Queen or higher cards.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), your hand's equity is low against a typical opponent range in a heads-up game, making it unlikely to justify the call in the long term, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is crucial.\n   - Folding avoids unnecessary risk and conserves your stack for stronger hands, particularly given the early aggressive plays in previous hands and the potential for your opponent to have a better range.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and minimal upside, folding is the safest play to minimize losses and wait for a more favorable opportunity in this tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1170.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 8\u2665, J\u2663\n==============================================",

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes. While it's a playable hand, the raise by the Big Blind indicates they have a strong hand.\n   - The current bet is 40 chips, and you've already contributed 20 chips. You need to call an additional 20 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are 60 (pot) to 20 (additional call), or 3:1, which is favorable. However, the Big Blind's raise suggests they have a strong hand, potentially making your suited connector less appealing.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Calling the raise with a suited connector like 7\u2660, 6\u2660 is a viable option due to the favorable pot odds and the potential for making a strong hand post-flop. However, be prepared for a possible continuation bet (CBet) from the Big Blind on the flop.\n   - Folding is also a reasonable option if you believe the Big Blind has a very strong hand, as indicated by their raise.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy. It allows you to build the pot and apply pressure.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play.

In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further.

Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board.

Calling the bet allows you to see the next card, but it risks facing another bet or a strong hand from your opponent.\n   - Folding is a viable option if you believe your opponent has a stronger hand, which is likely given their bet.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 80 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 840.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1130.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 7\u2666, 10\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:7/10\n - Phase: Pre-flop\n - Board: []\n - Pot:30 chips\n - Current bet:20 chips\n - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n - Your hole cards: K\u2663,9\u2665\n - Your chips:1130 (with20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - Your hand is K\u2663,9\u2665, an offsuit King-nine.

You need to call an additional10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n - The pot odds are favorable for calling (pot is30 chips, and you need to call10 more), and in a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - Given the marginal strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a hand or fold if the flop doesn't improve your hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 840.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1130.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 7\u2666, 10\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 7/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2666, 10\u2663\n   - Your chips: 840 (with 10 already bet as BB, requiring an additional 10 chips to match the current bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, is an offsuit connector with modest potential for improvement (e.g., straight draws), but it's a weak starting hand overall in pre-flop, especially against a possible raise from the Small Blind (P1). The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important. Folding avoids committing more to a marginal hand, while calling could allow you to see the flop cheaply and potentially improve, though it's risky given the hand's weakness.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the low cost to call and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable option to stay in the hand and reassess on the flop. However, if you suspect P1 has a strong range (based on their action), folding could conserve chips for better spots. Here, the marginal hand and pot odds lean toward calling to maintain flexibility.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 7/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [4\u2665, A\u2665, Q\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2663, 9\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1120\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [4\u2665, A\u2665, Q\u2665], showing three hearts, which indicates a strong heart flush draw is likely for anyone holding two hearts.\n   - Your hand is K\u2663, 9\u2665, giving you a heart flush draw with nine outs to improve to a flush. This is a strong draw, especially since you're likely behind at the moment.\n   - With no current bet, checking is a valid action to see how the hand develops, but you could also consider betting to take control of the hand and potentially build the pot.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong flush draw, betting is a viable strategy to apply pressure and potentially build the pot. A bet of around half the pot (20 chips) is a reasonable sizing to achieve this.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 20 chips is `[Bet 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [4\u2665, A\u2665, Q\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 830.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1110.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 7\u2666, 10\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 7/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [4\u2665, A\u2665, Q\u2665]\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2666, 10\u2663\n   - Your chips: 830\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [4\u2665, A\u2665, Q\u2665], which is a highly coordinated board with three hearts, likely completing flushes for players holding two hearts and providing strong high-card potential with the Ace and Queen. Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, has no hearts and doesn't connect with the board in any way\u2014no pairs, straights, or draws\u2014leaving you with just 10 high, which is almost certainly behind any made hand or draw that Player 1 might have.\n   - Player 1's bet of 20 chips indicates strength, as they're likely holding at least a pair, a flush, or a draw that's worth protecting. In a heads-up game, this board texture is dangerous for speculative calls, and your lack of equity makes it unlikely to improve sufficiently on the turn or river.\n   - Pot odds are 60:20 (3:1), which might seem tempting, but your hand has minimal potential against Player 1's apparent strength, making calling a high-risk move with poor expected value. Raising would be overly aggressive with nothing, while folding conserves your dwindling chip stack for better opportunities later in the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the high likelihood that Player 1 has a superior holding, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and maintain your stack, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is key.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 60 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2665, 4\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 8/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: Q\u2665, 4\u2666\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, Q\u2665 and 4\u2666, is a weak offsuit combination with a Queen high and a low 4 as a kicker. This starting hand has limited potential for improvement, as it lacks connectivity for straights or flushes and is vulnerable to domination by stronger hands like those with a Queen or higher cards.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), your hand's equity is low against a typical opponent range in a heads-up game, making it unlikely to justify the call in the long term, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is crucial.\n   - Folding avoids unnecessary risk and conserves your stack for stronger hands, particularly given the early aggressive plays in previous hands and the potential for your opponent to have a better range.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and minimal upside, folding is the safest play to minimize losses and wait for a more favorable opportunity in this tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1170.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2660, Q\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 9/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 8\u2665, J\u2663\n   - Your chips: 800 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2663, 8\u2665, which is a marginal starting hand.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand.

This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting.

Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy. It allows you to build the pot and apply pressure. A bet of around half the pot (40 chips) is a reasonable sizing to achieve this.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], which is a low-textured board with no pairs and two diamonds, potentially indicating diamond flush draws for opponents. Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660.

You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't changed significantly for your hand, as the Q\u2663 doesn't directly affect your pair of sevens. However, it's worth noting that the board still has two diamonds, indicating a possible flush draw for your opponent.\n   - Your opponent checked on the turn, which could indicate a variety of hand strengths, from weakness to a strong hand waiting to trap.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your hand is still relatively strong and the pot is significant, you should consider betting to build the pot or protect your hand.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play.

In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further.

This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand.

The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important. Folding avoids committing more to a marginal hand, while calling could allow you to see the flop cheaply and potentially improve, though it's risky given the hand's weakness.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the low cost to call and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable option to stay in the hand and reassess on the flop. However, if you suspect P1 has a strong range (based on their action), folding could conserve chips for better spots.

This is a strong draw, especially since you're likely behind at the moment.\n   - With no current bet, checking is a valid action to see how the hand develops, but you could also consider betting to take control of the hand and potentially build the pot.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong flush draw, betting is a viable strategy to apply pressure and potentially build the pot. A bet of around half the pot (20 chips) is a reasonable sizing to achieve this.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 20 chips is `[Bet 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [4\u2665, A\u2665, Q\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 830.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1110.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 7\u2666, 10\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 7/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [4\u2665, A\u2665, Q\u2665]\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2666, 10\u2663\n   - Your chips: 830\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [4\u2665, A\u2665, Q\u2665], which is a highly coordinated board with three hearts, likely completing flushes for players holding two hearts and providing strong high-card potential with the Ace and Queen. Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, has no hearts and doesn't connect with the board in any way\u2014no pairs, straights, or draws\u2014leaving you with just 10 high, which is almost certainly behind any made hand or draw that Player 1 might have.\n   - Player 1's bet of 20 chips indicates strength, as they're likely holding at least a pair, a flush, or a draw that's worth protecting. In a heads-up game, this board texture is dangerous for speculative calls, and your lack of equity makes it unlikely to improve sufficiently on the turn or river.\n   - Pot odds are 60:20 (3:1), which might seem tempting, but your hand has minimal potential against Player 1's apparent strength, making calling a high-risk move with poor expected value. Raising would be overly aggressive with nothing, while folding conserves your dwindling chip stack for better opportunities later in the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the high likelihood that Player 1 has a superior holding, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and maintain your stack, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is key.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 60 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2665, 4\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 8/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: Q\u2665, 4\u2666\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, Q\u2665 and 4\u2666, is a weak offsuit combination with a Queen high and a low 4 as a kicker. This starting hand has limited potential for improvement, as it lacks connectivity for straights or flushes and is vulnerable to domination by stronger hands like those with a Queen or higher cards.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), your hand's equity is low against a typical opponent range in a heads-up game, making it unlikely to justify the call in the long term, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is crucial.\n   - Folding avoids unnecessary risk and conserves your stack for stronger hands, particularly given the early aggressive plays in previous hands and the potential for your opponent to have a better range.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and minimal upside, folding is the safest play to minimize losses and wait for a more favorable opportunity in this tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1170.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2660, Q\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 9/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 8\u2665, J\u2663\n   - Your chips: 800 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2663, 8\u2665, which is a marginal starting hand. The Jack is a relatively strong card, but the 8 is a weaker kicker, and the cards are not suited.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling (30:10 or 3:1), and in a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the marginal strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a hand or fold if the flop doesn't improve your hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1170.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2660, Q\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 9/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2660, Q\u2666\n   - Your chips: 800 (with 10 already bet as BB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, 6\u2660 and Q\u2666, is a weak offsuit combination with Queen high and a low 6, offering limited potential for improvement (e.g., possible top pair with the Queen but vulnerable to being outkicked or dominated by stronger hands). In a heads-up game, this starting hand has poor equity against a typical opponent range, especially when they might be holding something better after posting their blind.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), the risk of committing chips with a marginal hand outweighs the reward, as there's no immediate strength or draws to justify staying in. Folding preserves your stack, which is crucial in the late stages of the tournament with only two hands left.\n   - Given your chip stack (800) is lower than your opponent's (1170), avoiding unnecessary calls with weak hands helps maintain survival chances for the final hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and better opportunities potentially in the next hand, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and conserve chips for a stronger position later.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 780.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1190.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 9\u2666\n==============================================",

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it.

In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 910.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't improved your hand, and there are no clear indications that you have the best hand. Your opponent checked, which could mean they are checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a stronger one.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (7\u2660, 6\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong hand, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 830\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665] features a mix of suits and ranks, with potential for straights (e.g., J-Q sequence) or flush draws (two diamonds). Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play. It avoids unnecessary risk and lets the hand resolve naturally.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 5:\nPlayer 0: K\u2665 A\u2665\nPlayer 1: 3\u2666 2\u2666\nCommunity cards: 2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 320 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: A\u2660, J\u2665\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, A\u2660 and J\u2665, is a solid starting hand (Ace-Jack offsuit), offering strong high-card potential and the ability to make top pair or better on the flop. In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further.

This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a playable starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, which is the amount of the Big Blind. You have already posted 10 chips as the Big Blind, so you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a reasonable action to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the Small Blind's bet is a reasonable action.

This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand.

The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important.

Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, has no hearts and doesn't connect with the board in any way\u2014no pairs, straights, or draws\u2014leaving you with just 10 high, which is almost certainly behind any made hand or draw that Player 1 might have.\n   - Player 1's bet of 20 chips indicates strength, as they're likely holding at least a pair, a flush, or a draw that's worth protecting. In a heads-up game, this board texture is dangerous for speculative calls, and your lack of equity makes it unlikely to improve sufficiently on the turn or river.\n   - Pot odds are 60:20 (3:1), which might seem tempting, but your hand has minimal potential against Player 1's apparent strength, making calling a high-risk move with poor expected value.

While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), your hand's equity is low against a typical opponent range in a heads-up game, making it unlikely to justify the call in the long term, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is crucial.\n   - Folding avoids unnecessary risk and conserves your stack for stronger hands, particularly given the early aggressive plays in previous hands and the potential for your opponent to have a better range.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and minimal upside, folding is the safest play to minimize losses and wait for a more favorable opportunity in this tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1170.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 8\u2665, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 9/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 8\u2665, J\u2663\n   - Your chips: 800 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2663, 8\u2665, which is a marginal starting hand. The Jack is a relatively strong card, but the 8 is a weaker kicker, and the cards are not suited.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling (30:10 or 3:1), and in a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the marginal strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a hand or fold if the flop doesn't improve your hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 9/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2660, Q\u2666\n   - Your chips: 800 (with 10 already bet as BB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, 6\u2660 and Q\u2666, is a weak offsuit combination with Queen high and a low 6, offering limited potential for improvement (e.g., possible top pair with the Queen but vulnerable to being outkicked or dominated by stronger hands). In a heads-up game, this starting hand has poor equity against a typical opponent range, especially when they might be holding something better after posting their blind.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), the risk of committing chips with a marginal hand outweighs the reward, as there's no immediate strength or draws to justify staying in. Folding preserves your stack, which is crucial in the late stages of the tournament with only two hands left.\n   - Given your chip stack (800) is lower than your opponent's (1170), avoiding unnecessary calls with weak hands helps maintain survival chances for the final hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and better opportunities potentially in the next hand, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and conserve chips for a stronger position later.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 780.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1190.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 9\u2665, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 10/10 (final hand)\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 9\u2666\n   - Your chips: 780 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 9\u2666, is a marginal offsuit connector with potential for straight draws (e.g., if the board brings a 10 and 8). While not a premium hand, it has some equity in a heads-up game, especially against the Big Blind's range.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), making this a low-risk call relative to the potential reward. In the final hand of the tournament, folding would likely end your chances, as your stack is dwindling, so staying in the game offers the last opportunity to recover or win the pot.\n   - Risks include being dominated by stronger hands (e.g., those with a Jack or higher), but the favorable odds and straight potential justify calling to assess the flop, rather than conceding immediately.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that this is the last hand and the pot odds are in your favor, calling is a reasonable play to keep the hand alive and potentially improve on the flop, rather than folding and exiting the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 780.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1190.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 9\u2665, 10\u2660\n==============================================",

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind.

In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1030.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws.

You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't changed significantly for your hand, as the Q\u2663 doesn't directly affect your pair of sevens. However, it's worth noting that the board still has two diamonds, indicating a possible flush draw for your opponent.\n   - Your opponent checked on the turn, which could indicate a variety of hand strengths, from weakness to a strong hand waiting to trap.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your hand is still relatively strong and the pot is significant, you should consider betting to build the pot or protect your hand. A moderate bet (e.g., around half the pot) could be appropriate.\n   - Checking is also an option if you want to see the river card for free, but this gives your opponent a chance to improve or check behind with a stronger hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with a chosen amount is `[Bet N]`.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (7\u2660, 6\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong hand, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 830.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 850.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 830\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665] features a mix of suits and ranks, with potential for straights (e.g., J-Q sequence) or flush draws (two diamonds). Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play.

In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further.

This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand.

The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important. Folding avoids committing more to a marginal hand, while calling could allow you to see the flop cheaply and potentially improve, though it's risky given the hand's weakness.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the low cost to call and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable option to stay in the hand and reassess on the flop. However, if you suspect P1 has a strong range (based on their action), folding could conserve chips for better spots.

Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, has no hearts and doesn't connect with the board in any way\u2014no pairs, straights, or draws\u2014leaving you with just 10 high, which is almost certainly behind any made hand or draw that Player 1 might have.\n   - Player 1's bet of 20 chips indicates strength, as they're likely holding at least a pair, a flush, or a draw that's worth protecting. In a heads-up game, this board texture is dangerous for speculative calls, and your lack of equity makes it unlikely to improve sufficiently on the turn or river.\n   - Pot odds are 60:20 (3:1), which might seem tempting, but your hand has minimal potential against Player 1's apparent strength, making calling a high-risk move with poor expected value. Raising would be overly aggressive with nothing, while folding conserves your dwindling chip stack for better opportunities later in the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the high likelihood that Player 1 has a superior holding, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and maintain your stack, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is key.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 60 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2665, 4\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 8/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: Q\u2665, 4\u2666\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, Q\u2665 and 4\u2666, is a weak offsuit combination with a Queen high and a low 4 as a kicker. This starting hand has limited potential for improvement, as it lacks connectivity for straights or flushes and is vulnerable to domination by stronger hands like those with a Queen or higher cards.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand.

In a heads-up game, this starting hand has poor equity against a typical opponent range, especially when they might be holding something better after posting their blind.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), the risk of committing chips with a marginal hand outweighs the reward, as there's no immediate strength or draws to justify staying in. Folding preserves your stack, which is crucial in the late stages of the tournament with only two hands left.\n   - Given your chip stack (800) is lower than your opponent's (1170), avoiding unnecessary calls with weak hands helps maintain survival chances for the final hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and better opportunities potentially in the next hand, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and conserve chips for a stronger position later.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 780.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1190.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 9\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 10/10 (final hand)\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 9\u2666\n   - Your chips: 780 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 9\u2666, is a marginal offsuit connector with potential for straight draws (e.g., if the board brings a 10 and 8). While not a premium hand, it has some equity in a heads-up game, especially against the Big Blind's range.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), making this a low-risk call relative to the potential reward. In the final hand of the tournament, folding would likely end your chances, as your stack is dwindling, so staying in the game offers the last opportunity to recover or win the pot.\n   - Risks include being dominated by stronger hands (e.g., those with a Jack or higher), but the favorable odds and straight potential justify calling to assess the flop, rather than conceding immediately.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that this is the last hand and the pot odds are in your favor, calling is a reasonable play to keep the hand alive and potentially improve on the flop, rather than folding and exiting the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 10/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 9\u2665, 10\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1190 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 9\u2665, 10\u2660, a marginal offsuit connector.

The board includes two hearts, which could indicate flush draws for your opponent, and the King is a high card that might pair their hand. Your hand has potential for improvement but isn't made, so you're on a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to either check and see the turn cheaply or bet to build the pot and apply pressure, especially since this is the final hand of the tournament. Betting could force a fold from a weak hand or extract value if your opponent has a marginal holding, while checking risks giving them a free card.\n   - Considering it's the last hand and your chip stack is lower than your opponent's, betting a moderate amount (e.g., 20 chips, about half the pot) balances aggression with risk management, potentially capitalizing on your draw without overcommitting.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your straight draw and the importance of this final hand, betting is a proactive play to take control, build the pot, and maximize your chances of winning.

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it.

You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand.

With a top pair and a weak kicker, your hand is vulnerable to being outkicked or facing a stronger hand.\n   - Calling the bet allows you to see the next card and assess the situation further. Folding might be too cautious if you believe your opponent is bluffing or semi-bluffing, but it's a viable option if you think their range is strong.\n   - Raising could be seen as aggressive and might put pressure on your opponent, but it also risks committing more chips with a potentially dominated hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand.

You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't changed significantly for your hand, as the Q\u2663 doesn't directly affect your pair of sevens. However, it's worth noting that the board still has two diamonds, indicating a possible flush draw for your opponent.\n   - Your opponent checked on the turn, which could indicate a variety of hand strengths, from weakness to a strong hand waiting to trap.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your hand is still relatively strong and the pot is significant, you should consider betting to build the pot or protect your hand. A moderate bet (e.g., around half the pot) could be appropriate.\n   - Checking is also an option if you want to see the river card for free, but this gives your opponent a chance to improve or check behind with a stronger hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with a chosen amount is `[Bet N]`.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips. Raising could risk losing more against a strong hand, while folding gives up potential equity in an early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 830.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 850.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 850\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660. You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't improved your hand, and there are no clear indications that you have the best hand. Your opponent checked, which could mean they are checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a stronger one.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (7\u2660, 6\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong hand, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 830\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665] features a mix of suits and ranks, with potential for straights (e.g., J-Q sequence) or flush draws (two diamonds). Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play. It avoids unnecessary risk and lets the hand resolve naturally.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 5:\nPlayer 0: K\u2665 A\u2665\nPlayer 1: 3\u2666 2\u2666\nCommunity cards: 2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 320 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: A\u2660, J\u2665\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, A\u2660 and J\u2665, is a solid starting hand (Ace-Jack offsuit), offering strong high-card potential and the ability to make top pair or better on the flop. In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further.

This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a playable starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, which is the amount of the Big Blind. You have already posted 10 chips as the Big Blind, so you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a reasonable action to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the Small Blind's bet is a reasonable action.

This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand.

The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important.

Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, has no hearts and doesn't connect with the board in any way\u2014no pairs, straights, or draws\u2014leaving you with just 10 high, which is almost certainly behind any made hand or draw that Player 1 might have.\n   - Player 1's bet of 20 chips indicates strength, as they're likely holding at least a pair, a flush, or a draw that's worth protecting. In a heads-up game, this board texture is dangerous for speculative calls, and your lack of equity makes it unlikely to improve sufficiently on the turn or river.\n   - Pot odds are 60:20 (3:1), which might seem tempting, but your hand has minimal potential against Player 1's apparent strength, making calling a high-risk move with poor expected value.

This starting hand has limited potential for improvement, as it lacks connectivity for straights or flushes and is vulnerable to domination by stronger hands like those with a Queen or higher cards.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand.

This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a hand or fold if the flop doesn't improve your hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 9/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2660, Q\u2666\n   - Your chips: 800 (with 10 already bet as BB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, 6\u2660 and Q\u2666, is a weak offsuit combination with Queen high and a low 6, offering limited potential for improvement (e.g., possible top pair with the Queen but vulnerable to being outkicked or dominated by stronger hands). In a heads-up game, this starting hand has poor equity against a typical opponent range, especially when they might be holding something better after posting their blind.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), the risk of committing chips with a marginal hand outweighs the reward, as there's no immediate strength or draws to justify staying in. Folding preserves your stack, which is crucial in the late stages of the tournament with only two hands left.\n   - Given your chip stack (800) is lower than your opponent's (1170), avoiding unnecessary calls with weak hands helps maintain survival chances for the final hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and better opportunities potentially in the next hand, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and conserve chips for a stronger position later.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 780.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1190.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 9\u2665, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 10/10 (final hand)\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 9\u2666\n   - Your chips: 780 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 9\u2666, is a marginal offsuit connector with potential for straight draws (e.g., if the board brings a 10 and 8). While not a premium hand, it has some equity in a heads-up game, especially against the Big Blind's range.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), making this a low-risk call relative to the potential reward. In the final hand of the tournament, folding would likely end your chances, as your stack is dwindling, so staying in the game offers the last opportunity to recover or win the pot.\n   - Risks include being dominated by stronger hands (e.g., those with a Jack or higher), but the favorable odds and straight potential justify calling to assess the flop, rather than conceding immediately.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that this is the last hand and the pot odds are in your favor, calling is a reasonable play to keep the hand alive and potentially improve on the flop, rather than folding and exiting the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 780.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1190.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 9\u2665, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 10/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 9\u2665, 10\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1190 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 9\u2665, 10\u2660, a marginal offsuit connector.

The board includes two hearts, which could indicate flush draws for your opponent, and the King is a high card that might pair their hand. Your hand has potential for improvement but isn't made, so you're on a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to either check and see the turn cheaply or bet to build the pot and apply pressure, especially since this is the final hand of the tournament. Betting could force a fold from a weak hand or extract value if your opponent has a marginal holding, while checking risks giving them a free card.\n   - Considering it's the last hand and your chip stack is lower than your opponent's, betting a moderate amount (e.g., 20 chips, about half the pot) balances aggression with risk management, potentially capitalizing on your draw without overcommitting.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your straight draw and the importance of this final hand, betting is a proactive play to take control, build the pot, and maximize your chances of winning.

You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it.

However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws.

A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660.

You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't changed significantly for your hand, as the Q\u2663 doesn't directly affect your pair of sevens. However, it's worth noting that the board still has two diamonds, indicating a possible flush draw for your opponent.\n   - Your opponent checked on the turn, which could indicate a variety of hand strengths, from weakness to a strong hand waiting to trap.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your hand is still relatively strong and the pot is significant, you should consider betting to build the pot or protect your hand. A moderate bet (e.g., around half the pot) could be appropriate.\n   - Checking is also an option if you want to see the river card for free, but this gives your opponent a chance to improve or check behind with a stronger hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with a chosen amount is `[Bet N]`.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

Your opponent checked, which could mean they are checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a stronger one.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (7\u2660, 6\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong hand, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 830.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 850.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 830\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665] features a mix of suits and ranks, with potential for straights (e.g., J-Q sequence) or flush draws (two diamonds). Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play.

In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further.

This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand.

The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important. Folding avoids committing more to a marginal hand, while calling could allow you to see the flop cheaply and potentially improve, though it's risky given the hand's weakness.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the low cost to call and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable option to stay in the hand and reassess on the flop. However, if you suspect P1 has a strong range (based on their action), folding could conserve chips for better spots.

Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, has no hearts and doesn't connect with the board in any way\u2014no pairs, straights, or draws\u2014leaving you with just 10 high, which is almost certainly behind any made hand or draw that Player 1 might have.\n   - Player 1's bet of 20 chips indicates strength, as they're likely holding at least a pair, a flush, or a draw that's worth protecting. In a heads-up game, this board texture is dangerous for speculative calls, and your lack of equity makes it unlikely to improve sufficiently on the turn or river.\n   - Pot odds are 60:20 (3:1), which might seem tempting, but your hand has minimal potential against Player 1's apparent strength, making calling a high-risk move with poor expected value.

While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), your hand's equity is low against a typical opponent range in a heads-up game, making it unlikely to justify the call in the long term, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is crucial.\n   - Folding avoids unnecessary risk and conserves your stack for stronger hands, particularly given the early aggressive plays in previous hands and the potential for your opponent to have a better range.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and minimal upside, folding is the safest play to minimize losses and wait for a more favorable opportunity in this tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1170.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2660, Q\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 9/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 8\u2665, J\u2663\n   - Your chips: 800 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2663, 8\u2665, which is a marginal starting hand. The Jack is a relatively strong card, but the 8 is a weaker kicker, and the cards are not suited.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling (30:10 or 3:1), and in a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the marginal strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a hand or fold if the flop doesn't improve your hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1170.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2660, Q\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 9/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2660, Q\u2666\n   - Your chips: 800 (with 10 already bet as BB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, 6\u2660 and Q\u2666, is a weak offsuit combination with Queen high and a low 6, offering limited potential for improvement (e.g., possible top pair with the Queen but vulnerable to being outkicked or dominated by stronger hands). In a heads-up game, this starting hand has poor equity against a typical opponent range, especially when they might be holding something better after posting their blind.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), the risk of committing chips with a marginal hand outweighs the reward, as there's no immediate strength or draws to justify staying in. Folding preserves your stack, which is crucial in the late stages of the tournament with only two hands left.\n   - Given your chip stack (800) is lower than your opponent's (1170), avoiding unnecessary calls with weak hands helps maintain survival chances for the final hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and better opportunities potentially in the next hand, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and conserve chips for a stronger position later.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 780.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1190.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 9\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 10/10 (final hand)\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 9\u2666\n   - Your chips: 780 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 9\u2666, is a marginal offsuit connector with potential for straight draws (e.g., if the board brings a 10 and 8). While not a premium hand, it has some equity in a heads-up game, especially against the Big Blind's range.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), making this a low-risk call relative to the potential reward. In the final hand of the tournament, folding would likely end your chances, as your stack is dwindling, so staying in the game offers the last opportunity to recover or win the pot.\n   - Risks include being dominated by stronger hands (e.g., those with a Jack or higher), but the favorable odds and straight potential justify calling to assess the flop, rather than conceding immediately.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that this is the last hand and the pot odds are in your favor, calling is a reasonable play to keep the hand alive and potentially improve on the flop, rather than folding and exiting the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 10/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 9\u2665, 10\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1190 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 9\u2665, 10\u2660, a marginal offsuit connector.

The board includes two hearts, which could indicate flush draws for your opponent, and the King is a high card that might pair their hand. Your hand has potential for improvement but isn't made, so you're on a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to either check and see the turn cheaply or bet to build the pot and apply pressure, especially since this is the final hand of the tournament. Betting could force a fold from a weak hand or extract value if your opponent has a marginal holding, while checking risks giving them a free card.\n   - Considering it's the last hand and your chip stack is lower than your opponent's, betting a moderate amount (e.g., 20 chips, about half the pot) balances aggression with risk management, potentially capitalizing on your draw without overcommitting.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your straight draw and the importance of this final hand, betting is a proactive play to take control, build the pot, and maximize your chances of winning.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it.

In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting.

You have a pair of sevens, which is a strong hand on this flop.\n   - The presence of two diamonds on the board indicates a possible diamond flush draw for opponents, but you don't have a diamond.\n   - With no current bet, checking is a valid action to see how the hand develops.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is a safe play to proceed to the next round without committing additional chips.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], which includes two diamonds, indicating a potential diamond flush draw. Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy. It allows you to build the pot and apply pressure. A bet of around half the pot (40 chips) is a reasonable sizing to achieve this.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], which is a low-textured board with no pairs and two diamonds, potentially indicating diamond flush draws for opponents. Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 910.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 970.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660.

You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't changed significantly for your hand, as the Q\u2663 doesn't directly affect your pair of sevens. However, it's worth noting that the board still has two diamonds, indicating a possible flush draw for your opponent.\n   - Your opponent checked on the turn, which could indicate a variety of hand strengths, from weakness to a strong hand waiting to trap.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your hand is still relatively strong and the pot is significant, you should consider betting to build the pot or protect your hand. A moderate bet (e.g., around half the pot) could be appropriate.\n   - Checking is also an option if you want to see the river card for free, but this gives your opponent a chance to improve or check behind with a stronger hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with a chosen amount is `[Bet N]`.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

You still have a pair of sevens.\n   - The board hasn't improved your hand, and there are no clear indications that you have the best hand. Your opponent checked, which could mean they are checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a stronger one.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (7\u2660, 6\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong hand, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 830\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665] features a mix of suits and ranks, with potential for straights (e.g., J-Q sequence) or flush draws (two diamonds). Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play.

In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further.

This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a playable starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, which is the amount of the Big Blind. You have already posted 10 chips as the Big Blind, so you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a reasonable action to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the Small Blind's bet is a reasonable action.

This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand.

The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important. Folding avoids committing more to a marginal hand, while calling could allow you to see the flop cheaply and potentially improve, though it's risky given the hand's weakness.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the low cost to call and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable option to stay in the hand and reassess on the flop. However, if you suspect P1 has a strong range (based on their action), folding could conserve chips for better spots. Here, the marginal hand and pot odds lean toward calling to maintain flexibility.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 10.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [4\u2665, A\u2665, Q\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 830.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1130.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2666, 7\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 7/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [4\u2665, A\u2665, Q\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2663, 9\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1120\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [4\u2665, A\u2665, Q\u2665], showing three hearts, which indicates a strong heart flush draw is likely for anyone holding two hearts.\n   - Your hand is K\u2663, 9\u2665, giving you a heart flush draw with nine outs to improve to a flush. This is a strong draw, especially since you're likely behind at the moment.\n   - With no current bet, checking is a valid action to see how the hand develops, but you could also consider betting to take control of the hand and potentially build the pot.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong flush draw, betting is a viable strategy to apply pressure and potentially build the pot.

Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, has no hearts and doesn't connect with the board in any way\u2014no pairs, straights, or draws\u2014leaving you with just 10 high, which is almost certainly behind any made hand or draw that Player 1 might have.\n   - Player 1's bet of 20 chips indicates strength, as they're likely holding at least a pair, a flush, or a draw that's worth protecting. In a heads-up game, this board texture is dangerous for speculative calls, and your lack of equity makes it unlikely to improve sufficiently on the turn or river.\n   - Pot odds are 60:20 (3:1), which might seem tempting, but your hand has minimal potential against Player 1's apparent strength, making calling a high-risk move with poor expected value. Raising would be overly aggressive with nothing, while folding conserves your dwindling chip stack for better opportunities later in the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the high likelihood that Player 1 has a superior holding, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and maintain your stack, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is key.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 60 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2666, 6\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 8/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: Q\u2665, 4\u2666\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, Q\u2665 and 4\u2666, is a weak offsuit combination with a Queen high and a low 4 as a kicker. This starting hand has limited potential for improvement, as it lacks connectivity for straights or flushes and is vulnerable to domination by stronger hands like those with a Queen or higher cards.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), your hand's equity is low against a typical opponent range in a heads-up game, making it unlikely to justify the call in the long term, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is crucial.\n   - Folding avoids unnecessary risk and conserves your stack for stronger hands, particularly given the early aggressive plays in previous hands and the potential for your opponent to have a better range.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and minimal upside, folding is the safest play to minimize losses and wait for a more favorable opportunity in this tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1170.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 8\u2665, J\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 9/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 8\u2665, J\u2663\n   - Your chips: 800 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2663, 8\u2665, which is a marginal starting hand. The Jack is a relatively strong card, but the 8 is a weaker kicker, and the cards are not suited.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling (30:10 or 3:1), and in a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the marginal strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a hand or fold if the flop doesn't improve your hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 9/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2660, Q\u2666\n   - Your chips: 800 (with 10 already bet as BB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, 6\u2660 and Q\u2666, is a weak offsuit combination with Queen high and a low 6, offering limited potential for improvement (e.g., possible top pair with the Queen but vulnerable to being outkicked or dominated by stronger hands). In a heads-up game, this starting hand has poor equity against a typical opponent range, especially when they might be holding something better after posting their blind.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), the risk of committing chips with a marginal hand outweighs the reward, as there's no immediate strength or draws to justify staying in. Folding preserves your stack, which is crucial in the late stages of the tournament with only two hands left.\n   - Given your chip stack (800) is lower than your opponent's (1170), avoiding unnecessary calls with weak hands helps maintain survival chances for the final hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and better opportunities potentially in the next hand, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and conserve chips for a stronger position later.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 780.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1190.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 9\u2665, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 10/10 (final hand)\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 9\u2666\n   - Your chips: 780 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 9\u2666, is a marginal offsuit connector with potential for straight draws (e.g., if the board brings a 10 and 8). While not a premium hand, it has some equity in a heads-up game, especially against the Big Blind's range.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), making this a low-risk call relative to the potential reward. In the final hand of the tournament, folding would likely end your chances, as your stack is dwindling, so staying in the game offers the last opportunity to recover or win the pot.\n   - Risks include being dominated by stronger hands (e.g., those with a Jack or higher), but the favorable odds and straight potential justify calling to assess the flop, rather than conceding immediately.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given that this is the last hand and the pot odds are in your favor, calling is a reasonable play to keep the hand alive and potentially improve on the flop, rather than folding and exiting the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 780.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1190.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 9\u2665, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 10/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 9\u2665, 10\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1190 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 9\u2665, 10\u2660, a marginal offsuit connector.

The board includes two hearts, which could indicate flush draws for your opponent, and the King is a high card that might pair their hand. Your hand has potential for improvement but isn't made, so you're on a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to either check and see the turn cheaply or bet to build the pot and apply pressure, especially since this is the final hand of the tournament.

The7\u2660 on the turn doesn't directly help your hand but adds to the board's texture.\n - Your hand is6\u2666, K\u2660. While you don't have a strong hand yet, you have a backdoor flush draw with the6\u2666 and the presence of diamonds on the board (though only one diamond is currently visible). However, the more relevant factor is that the board hasn't directly connected with your hand.\n - The current bet is0, meaning you can check.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n - Since there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking is a passive play that allows you to see the next community card without committing more chips.\n - Your hand isn't strong currently, but checking doesn't commit you to the pot. You can reassess after the next card.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\nGiven the situation and the available actions, the most appropriate response is to check, as it doesn't commit additional chips and allows you to observe the next card.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: Turn\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The board now shows [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660], which includes an Ace (a strong high card that could pair with an opponent's hand) and a mix of suits, potentially indicating flush draws. The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice. It maintains a non-committal stance, preserving your stack for potentially better opportunities later in the hand or tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[Player 1] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 6\u2666, K\u2660\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The river card has been dealt, showing [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]. The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 1 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 40 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 980.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips.

In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements.

This avoids committing more chips to a potentially losing hand.\n - Raising could be seen as aggressive, but it might be too risky with a weak kicker.\n\n4. **Action**:\n - Given the potential strength of your opponent's hand and the board texture, **[Fold]** is a prudent choice to avoid losing more chips on a potentially dominated hand.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 120 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 980.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, A\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, which is a suited connector.

In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes.

You need to call an additional 20 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are 60 (pot) to 20 (additional call), or 3:1, which is favorable.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly. You have nine outs to complete the flush (any remaining diamond), making this a potentially strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, you have the option to check or bet. Betting could build the pot and protect your hand by making it more expensive for opponents to continue, but it also risks being raised if your opponent has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong draw and the potential for improving to a very strong hand, betting is a viable strategy.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet). This can help build the pot, protect against potential draws (like the diamond flush), or force a fold from a weak hand. The board's texture suggests your opponent might be on a draw or a speculative hand.\n   - With no current bet, betting allows you to take control and extract value if your opponent has something marginal. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is a balanced sizing that applies pressure without overcommitting early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong starting hand and the opportunity to c-bet on a relatively dry board, initiating a bet is the appropriate play to build the pot and gather information about your opponent's holdings.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666]\n   - Pot: 120 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 970\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666], and your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that are higher than the board's highest card (Queen), giving you strong high-card potential and a heart flush draw.\n   - Player 1 has bet 80 chips, suggesting they might have connected with the board (e.g., a pair or a draw) or are applying pressure. Your hand has equity with nine hearts for a flush, plus possibilities for pairing your Ace or King on the river.\n   - Pot odds are favorable: The pot is 240 chips, and calling 80 gives you 240:80 or 3:1 odds. This makes calling viable to see the river and potentially improve, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can be balanced with caution.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With your strong draw and overcards, calling maintains your position in the hand without overcommitting chips.

In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further.

Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand.

The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important. Folding avoids committing more to a marginal hand, while calling could allow you to see the flop cheaply and potentially improve, though it's risky given the hand's weakness.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the low cost to call and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable option to stay in the hand and reassess on the flop. However, if you suspect P1 has a strong range (based on their action), folding could conserve chips for better spots.

This is a strong draw, especially since you're likely behind at the moment.\n   - With no current bet, checking is a valid action to see how the hand develops, but you could also consider betting to take control of the hand and potentially build the pot.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong flush draw, betting is a viable strategy to apply pressure and potentially build the pot.

Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, has no hearts and doesn't connect with the board in any way\u2014no pairs, straights, or draws\u2014leaving you with just 10 high, which is almost certainly behind any made hand or draw that Player 1 might have.\n   - Player 1's bet of 20 chips indicates strength, as they're likely holding at least a pair, a flush, or a draw that's worth protecting. In a heads-up game, this board texture is dangerous for speculative calls, and your lack of equity makes it unlikely to improve sufficiently on the turn or river.\n   - Pot odds are 60:20 (3:1), which might seem tempting, but your hand has minimal potential against Player 1's apparent strength, making calling a high-risk move with poor expected value. Raising would be overly aggressive with nothing, while folding conserves your dwindling chip stack for better opportunities later in the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the high likelihood that Player 1 has a superior holding, folding is the prudent choice to minimize losses and maintain your stack, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is key.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 60 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: Q\u2665, 4\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 8/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: Q\u2665, 4\u2666\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, Q\u2665 and 4\u2666, is a weak offsuit combination with a Queen high and a low 4 as a kicker. This starting hand has limited potential for improvement, as it lacks connectivity for straights or flushes and is vulnerable to domination by stronger hands like those with a Queen or higher cards.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), your hand's equity is low against a typical opponent range in a heads-up game, making it unlikely to justify the call in the long term, especially in the later stages of the tournament where chip preservation is crucial.\n   - Folding avoids unnecessary risk and conserves your stack for stronger hands, particularly given the early aggressive plays in previous hands and the potential for your opponent to have a better range.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and minimal upside, folding is the safest play to minimize losses and wait for a more favorable opportunity in this tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 9 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 1170.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 6\u2660, Q\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 9/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 8\u2665, J\u2663\n   - Your chips: 800 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is J\u2663, 8\u2665, which is a marginal starting hand.

In a heads-up game, this starting hand has poor equity against a typical opponent range, especially when they might be holding something better after posting their blind.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. While the pot odds are favorable (30:10 or 3:1), the risk of committing chips with a marginal hand outweighs the reward, as there's no immediate strength or draws to justify staying in.

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 10/10 (final hand)\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [8\u2665, K\u2665, 4\u2660, J\u2660, 8\u2663]\n   - Pot: 160 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 9\u2666\n   - Your chips: 720\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The board [8\u2665, K\u2665, 4\u2660, J\u2660, 8\u2663] includes two pairs on the board (two 8s and a J), with potential flush draws (two hearts). Your hand, J\u2663 and 9\u2666, gives you two pair: Jacks (from J\u2663 and J\u2660) and Eights (from the two 8s on the board). This is likely a strong hand, potentially the best at the table.\n   - Player 1's possible hand (based on their earlier actions and general game context) might include a pair of Eights or a weaker holding, but your two pair should hold up against most draws or marginal hands they could have.\n   - With no current bet on the river, this is an ideal opportunity to bet for value, as betting can extract chips from a weaker hand or draw while building the pot in this decisive final hand. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 80 chips) is a balanced size to encourage a call without risking too much if they fold.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong two-pair hand and the fact that this is the last hand of the tournament, betting is the optimal play to maximize value and pressure your opponent, potentially securing the win.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 80 chips is `[Bet 80]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 80]`",

The 7\u2660 adds little to your hand but increases the board's overall texture.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, still has no direct connections to the board\u2014no pairs, straights, or strong draws. You do have a 8\u2666 matching the 5\u2666 on the board, giving you a weak flush draw, but it's not compelling enough to bet aggressively.\n   - With no current bet, the round remains passive, and checking allows you to conserve chips and proceed to the river without risking more.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the prudent choice.

The board now clearly indicates a heart flush draw has been completed for anyone with two hearts, given the presence of three hearts on the board (3\u2665, A\u2665, 9\u2665).\n   - Your hand is 6\u2666, K\u2660. Unfortunately, you haven't improved to a strong hand; the K\u2660 is still unpaired and doesn't connect with the board, and the 6\u2666 doesn't make a flush.\n   - The current bet is 0, meaning you can check. However, considering the board's texture and the fact that it's the river, you should assess the likelihood of your opponent having a strong hand.\n\n3. **Analysis of Opponent's Hand**:\n   - Given the board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665], your opponent could have a heart flush if they held two hearts. They could also have a strong hand like AA or a decent hand like a pair or two pair if they played cautiously.\n   - Since they checked through to the river without betting, they might be checking with a weaker hand or trapping with a very strong hand.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since the hand is over and it's the river, and there's no bet, you can choose to check. Checking at this stage doesn't commit you to anything further since there are no more cards to be dealt.\n   - If you were to bet, you'd be risking chips without a strong hand. Given your hand (6\u2666, K\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong Ace, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n5. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 1/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Dealer/Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 8\u2666\n   - Your chips: 980\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665] presents a challenging texture with three hearts (indicating possible flush hands for opponents) and an Ace as the high card. This increases the likelihood that an opponent could have a strong hand, such as a flush or a pair involving the Ace.\n   - Your hand, J\u2663 and 8\u2666, results in no meaningful connections to the board\u2014 no pairs, straights, flushes, or even high-card dominance beyond a middling Jack. This is a very weak holding overall.\n   - With no current bet and the hand at its conclusion, the pot is uncontested, suggesting both players might be checking weak hands. Betting here could invite a call or raise from a stronger hand, while folding is unnecessary since there's no risk.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Checking is the most appropriate play to proceed to showdown without committing additional chips. This conserves your stack and avoids potential losses on a speculative bluff or value bet with a subpar hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 1:\nPlayer 0: J\u2663 8\u2666\nPlayer 1: 6\u2666 K\u2660\nCommunity cards: 5\u2666, 3\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2660, 9\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 40 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 2 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 960.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2660, 4\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 2/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 2\u2666, 8\u2663\n   - Your chips: 960 (with 20 already bet as SB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 2\u2666 and 8\u2663, which is a weak, unsuited low-card combination with no immediate potential for pairs, straights, or flushes. In pre-flop, this is one of the worst starting hands, often referred to as \"trash\" in poker terminology.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, which you've already matched by posting the small blind. However, in a 2-player game, this could mean the big blind (P1) might raise, and continuing with such a weak hand exposes you to unnecessary risk.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, preserving chips is crucial. Folding here avoids the potential for losing more chips on a hand with no value, allowing you to wait for a stronger starting hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With no connection to potential community cards and the hand's overall weakness, folding is the prudent choice.

This type of hand has good potential for making straights and flushes, making it a relatively strong starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you have already posted 10 chips as the small blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to match the big blind's bet.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a good opportunity to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the big blind's bet is a reasonable action. This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 3/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)\n   - Your hole cards: 5\u2665, 8\u2665\n   - Your chips: 950 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 5\u2665 and 8\u2665, which is a low suited connector. While it's suited (offering some flush potential), the low card values make it a weak starting hand overall, with minimal chances of improving to a strong hand pre-flop.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand (since you've already posted 10 as BB). In a heads-up game, calling with such a marginal hand risks unnecessary chips against an opponent who may have a stronger range.\n   - Given the early stage of the tournament and your chip stack, folding preserves your chips for better opportunities, especially since this hand has little equity and no immediate value.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - With a weak starting hand and the potential for loss, folding is the safest play to avoid committing more chips unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to surrender your hand is `[Fold]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Fold]`\n[GAME] Player 0 folds.\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 30 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930 (with 10 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 to call)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand consists of 4\u2663 and A\u2663, which features a strong Ace as the high card and is suited, providing potential for flush draws post-flop. In a heads-up game like this, starting hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they offer opportunities to win pots with high-card strength or improved draws.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to match the Big Blind's bet. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable for seeing the flop.\n   - Risks include a weak kicker (4\u2663), which could lead to problems if an Ace hits the board and you face a stronger Ace, but folding outright would mean losing your blind without a fight, which is suboptimal for a hand with decent equity.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of having an Ace and the suited nature of the hand, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and potentially capitalize on any improvements. This approach balances aggression with caution in the early stages of the tournament, preserving chips while staying in the game.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 930.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1040.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n   - Your chips: 1040 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is K\u2665, 2\u2665, which is a weak hand due to the low value of the 2 and the lack of a strong connection between the cards. Although they are suited, the potential for making a strong hand is limited.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips (the amount of the Big Blind), which is a standard bet to try to take the pot immediately or build it. You need to decide whether to continue with your hand.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, and you've already contributed 10 chips as the Big Blind. You need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand (K\u2665, 2\u2665), it's not particularly strong or promising for significant improvement. In a heads-up game, it's often reasonable to defend your blind with a wider range of hands, but K2 suited is on the weaker end.\n   - However, since you're already invested in the pot with your Big Blind bet, and the additional cost to call is relatively low (10 chips), it might be worth seeing the flop to assess the situation further.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 4/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2663, A\u2663\n   - Your chips: 930\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660], with the A\u2660 pairing your hole card A\u2663, giving you a pair of Aces\u2014a strong holding on the flop. Your 4\u2663 doesn't connect further but serves as a kicker.\n   - Potential threats include the K\u2660 on the board, which could give an opponent a higher pair if they hold a King, or possible straight/flush draws depending on the turn and river. However, your pair of Aces likely has the best hand at this moment.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to build the pot and extract value from potentially weaker hands or to protect against draws by betting. A moderate bet is appropriate given the pot size (40 chips) and the early tournament stage, balancing aggression with risk management.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Betting a reasonable amount, such as 20 chips, allows you to capitalize on your strong hand while controlling the pace of the hand.

The board also features a potential flush draw with two spades.\n   - Your hand, K\u2665, 2\u2665, has improved to a pair of Kings, but the kicker is weak. The Ace on the board could have paired your opponent's hand, potentially giving them a stronger hand.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to build the pot. Given the Ace on the board, it's possible they have an Ace.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - You need to consider the strength of your hand and the potential range of your opponent. With a top pair and a weak kicker, your hand is vulnerable to being outkicked or facing a stronger hand.\n   - Calling the bet allows you to see the next card and assess the situation further. Folding might be too cautious if you believe your opponent is bluffing or semi-bluffing, but it's a viable option if you think their range is strong.\n   - Raising could be seen as aggressive and might put pressure on your opponent, but it also risks committing more chips with a potentially dominated hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.

This is a strong holding, likely the best hand at the moment, but your kicker (4\u2663) is weak, making it vulnerable to being outkicked if your opponent has a better Ace or a King for two pair.\n   - The 9\u2666 on the turn adds minor texture but doesn't directly threaten your hand, though it could complete draws for others. Your opponent called your flop bet, suggesting they might have a marginal hand like a King or a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to apply pressure and build the pot with your strong hand. Betting can extract value from weaker made hands or force folds from draws, while checking risks giving a free card that could improve their hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your pair of Aces and the potential to get value, a moderate bet is appropriate to continue building the pot and protect against possible draws. A bet of 40 chips (about half the pot) is a balanced sizing that encourages calls from hands worse than yours without overcommitting.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 4 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 120 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [K\u2660, 6\u2663, A\u2660, 9\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 870.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1010.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2665, 2\u2665\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n - Hand:4/10\n - Phase: Turn\n - Board: [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666]\n - Pot:120 chips\n - Current bet:40 chips\n - Your position: Big Blind (BB)/Dealer\n - Your hole cards: K\u2665,2\u2665\n - Your chips:1010\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n - The turn card is [K\u2660,6\u2663, A\u2660,9\u2666], and your hand is K\u2665,2\u2665, giving you a pair of Kings.

This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a strong hand.\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - To match the big blind's bet of 20 chips, you need to call 10 more chips since you've already put in 10 chips as the small blind.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 980 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, is a premium starting hand (Ace-King suited), with high potential for strong post-flop plays, including pairs, straights, or flushes. In a heads-up game, this hand warrants aggression to build the pot and potentially isolate weaker hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by P1 (SB) calling the full amount. You have already posted 10 chips as BB, so you need to call an additional 10 chips or opt for a raise. Since no one has raised beyond the BB, this is an opportunity to take control by raising, which could force P1 to fold a weaker hand or commit more chips if they have something playable.\n   - Pot odds are favorable, and raising (e.g., by 20 chips) is a standard play with a strong hand like this, as it applies pressure and maximizes value early in the hand.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your hand, raising is the optimal move to build the pot and gain information about your opponent's hand. A moderate raise of 20 chips (increasing the total bet to 40) balances aggression without overcommitting in the early tournament stage.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to increase the bet by 20 chips is `[Raise 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Raise 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 raises to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 5 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: []\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 950.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 990.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: 7\u2660, 6\u2660\n   - Your chips: 990 (with 20 already bet)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 7\u2660, 6\u2660, a suited connector with potential for straights and flushes.

Your hand is A\u2665, K\u2665, giving you a flush draw with the Ace of hearts. \n   - While you have a strong draw, the flop hasn't paired your Ace or King directly.

Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, consists of overcards (Ace and King) that don't connect directly with the board, leaving you with high-card potential but no made hand.\n   - Having raised pre-flop and had your opponent call, you are in a position to maintain aggression with a continuation bet (c-bet).

Given your hand (7\u2660, 6\u2660) isn't strong and doesn't beat a likely flush or a strong hand, betting doesn't seem to be the best option without a read on your opponent's hand.\n   - Checking is the safest action here, allowing you to end the hand without further risk.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 5/10\n   - Phase: River\n   - Board: [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665]\n   - Pot: 320 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: K\u2665, A\u2665\n   - Your chips: 830\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The full board [2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665] features a mix of suits and ranks, with potential for straights (e.g., J-Q sequence) or flush draws (two diamonds). Your hand, K\u2665 and A\u2665, results in Ace high as your best possible holding, with no pairs, straights, or flushes made. This is a weak hand overall, especially on the river where no further improvements are possible.\n   - Your opponent (Player 1) checked on the river, which could indicate they are either weak or holding a marginal hand like a small pair (e.g., based on their earlier betting with 7\u2660, 6\u2660). The pot is already substantial at 320 chips, and there's no need to risk additional chips without a strong hand.\n   - With no current bet, checking allows you to proceed to showdown without committing more chips, preserving your stack for future hands in this tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the weak nature of your hand and the absence of any bets, checking is the safest and most prudent play. It avoids unnecessary risk and lets the hand resolve naturally.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to pass when there's no active bet is `[Check]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Check]`\n[GAME] Player 0 checks.\n[GAME] Showdown round 5:\nPlayer 0: K\u2665 A\u2665\nPlayer 1: 3\u2666 2\u2666\nCommunity cards: 2\u2663, 7\u2666, 9\u2666, Q\u2663, J\u2665\n[GAME] Player 1 wins the pot of 320 chips.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: A\u2660, J\u2665\n   - Your chips: 810 (with 20 already bet as SB, requiring an additional 10 chips to call the Big Blind)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand, A\u2660 and J\u2665, is a solid starting hand (Ace-Jack offsuit), offering strong high-card potential and the ability to make top pair or better on the flop. In a heads-up game, hands with an Ace are generally playable, as they provide good equity against a wide range of opponent hands.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, set by the Big Blind (P1), and you need to call an additional 10 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is small at 30 chips, and the cost to call is low relative to your stack, making the pot odds favorable (about 3:1). This is a good opportunity to see the flop and potentially capitalize on your hand's strength without overcommitting.\n   - Risks include being outkicked if an Ace hits the board, but folding would mean losing your blind without contest, which is not ideal for a hand with decent equity in the early stages of the tournament.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable play to see the flop and assess the situation further. This approach maintains a balanced strategy, preserving chips while staying in the game for potential improvement.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 810.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1160.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Pre-flop\n   - Board: []\n   - Pot: 30 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1160 (with 10 already bet as BB)\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - Your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660, a suited connector. This type of hand has potential for making straights and flushes, making it a playable starting hand, especially in a two-player game.\n   - The Small Blind has bet 20 chips, which is the amount of the Big Blind. You have already posted 10 chips as the Big Blind, so you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.\n   - The pot odds are favorable for calling, and with a hand that has good potential for improvement, it's a reasonable action to see the flop.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the strength of your starting hand and the favorable pot odds, calling the Small Blind's bet is a reasonable action.

This is a strong holding on the flop, potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's vulnerable to straight draws (due to J-Q-A sequence) or other pairs that opponents might hold.\n   - With no current bet, this is an excellent opportunity to build the pot and extract value from weaker hands or draws. Betting can also protect your hand against potential straight or flush draws on the board. Given the pot size of 40 chips, a moderate bet (e.g., 40 chips) is appropriate to apply pressure without overcommitting, especially in a heads-up game where aggression can force folds or elicit calls from speculative hands.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Your strong two-pair hand warrants betting to maximize value and control the hand. A bet of 40 chips, roughly equal to the pot, balances aggression with risk management in the middle of the tournament.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 40 chips is `[Bet 40]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 40]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 40.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 6 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 80 | Current bet: 40\nVisible board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\nP0 (SB): 770.00 chips | bet 40.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1150.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 6/10\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666]\n   - Pot: 80 chips\n   - Current bet: 40 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 4\u2660, 5\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1150\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [J\u2663, Q\u2660, A\u2666], and your hand is 4\u2660, 5\u2660.

The King-high or better hands would typically dominate this.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning P1 (SB) has likely called or raised, and you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop. The pot is small at 30 chips, offering favorable pot odds (about 3:1), but your hand has limited equity and risks being outdrawn or outplayed post-flop.\n   - In the early-to-mid stages of the tournament, preserving chips is important. Folding avoids committing more to a marginal hand, while calling could allow you to see the flop cheaply and potentially improve, though it's risky given the hand's weakness.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given the low cost to call and the favorable pot odds, calling is a reasonable option to stay in the hand and reassess on the flop. However, if you suspect P1 has a strong range (based on their action), folding could conserve chips for better spots.

Your hand, 7\u2666 and 10\u2663, has no hearts and doesn't connect with the board in any way\u2014no pairs, straights, or draws\u2014leaving you with just 10 high, which is almost certainly behind any made hand or draw that Player 1 might have.\n   - Player 1's bet of 20 chips indicates strength, as they're likely holding at least a pair, a flush, or a draw that's worth protecting. In a heads-up game, this board texture is dangerous for speculative calls, and your lack of equity makes it unlikely to improve sufficiently on the turn or river.\n   - Pot odds are 60:20 (3:1), which might seem tempting, but your hand has minimal potential against Player 1's apparent strength, making calling a high-risk move with poor expected value.

In a heads-up game, this starting hand has poor equity against a typical opponent range, especially when they might be holding something better after posting their blind.\n   - The current bet is 20 chips, meaning you need to call an additional 10 chips to see the flop.

This allows you to see the flop and potentially build a hand or fold if the flop doesn't improve your hand.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to match the current betting amount is `[Call]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Call]`\n[GAME] Player 1 calls 10.\n[Player 0] To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 10/10 (final hand)\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [8\u2665, K\u2665, 4\u2660]\n   - Pot: 40 chips\n   - Current bet: 0 chips\n   - Your position: Small Blind (SB)\n   - Your hole cards: J\u2663, 9\u2666\n   - Your chips: 780\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop shows [8\u2665, K\u2665, 4\u2660], with your hand (J\u2663, 9\u2666) giving you an open-ended straight draw (needing a 10 to complete a straight from 8-9-10-J). The board includes two hearts, which could indicate flush draws for your opponent, and the King is a high card that might pair their hand. Your hand has potential for improvement but isn't made, so you're on a draw.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to either check and see the turn cheaply or bet to build the pot and apply pressure, especially since this is the final hand of the tournament. Betting could force a fold from a weak hand or extract value if your opponent has a marginal holding, while checking risks giving them a free card.\n   - Considering it's the last hand and your chip stack is lower than your opponent's, betting a moderate amount (e.g., 20 chips, about half the pot) balances aggression with risk management, potentially capitalizing on your draw without overcommitting.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your straight draw and the importance of this final hand, betting is a proactive play to take control, build the pot, and maximize your chances of winning. This approach aligns with maintaining pressure in a heads-up scenario.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 20 chips is `[Bet 20]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 20]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 20.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 60 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: [8\u2665, K\u2665, 4\u2660]\nP0 (SB): 760.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1180.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 9\u2665, 10\u2660\n==============================================\n[Player 1] 1. **Current State**:\n   - Hand: 10/10 (final hand)\n   - Phase: Flop\n   - Board: [8\u2665, K\u2665, 4\u2660]\n   - Pot: 60 chips\n   - Current bet: 20 chips\n   - Your position: Big Blind (BB) and Dealer\n   - Your hole cards: 9\u2665, 10\u2660\n   - Your chips: 1180\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - The flop is [8\u2665, K\u2665, 4\u2660], and your hand is 9\u2665, 10\u2660. You have an open-ended straight draw (needing a 7 or J to complete) and a heart flush draw.\n   - The Small Blind (P0) has bet 20 chips, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to build the pot.

This is an improved holding from the flop, where you had an open-ended straight draw, but it remains vulnerable to overcards (e.g., a King or Ace in your opponent's hand) or heart flush draws due to the two hearts on the board.\n   - Your hand is moderate\u2014pair of Jacks with a 9 kicker\u2014potentially the best hand at the moment, but it's far from unbeatable. Player 1 called your flop bet of 20 chips, suggesting they might have a draw (like a heart flush) or a weaker made hand.\n   - With no current bet, this is an opportunity to bet and build the pot while applying pressure, especially in the final hand of the tournament. A bet could extract value from draws or force a fold from a marginal hand. Given the pot size of 80 chips, a bet of around half the pot (e.g., 40 chips) is balanced, allowing you to control the hand without overcommitting your stack.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Since this is the last hand and you have a pair that might be ahead, betting is the proactive choice to maximize value and maintain aggression.

Your hand, J\u2663 and 9\u2666, gives you two pair: Jacks (from J\u2663 and J\u2660) and Eights (from the two 8s on the board). This is likely a strong hand, potentially the best at the table.\n   - Player 1's possible hand (based on their earlier actions and general game context) might include a pair of Eights or a weaker holding, but your two pair should hold up against most draws or marginal hands they could have.\n   - With no current bet on the river, this is an ideal opportunity to bet for value, as betting can extract chips from a weaker hand or draw while building the pot in this decisive final hand. A bet of around half the pot (e.g., 80 chips) is a balanced size to encourage a call without risking too much if they fold.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - Given your strong two-pair hand and the fact that this is the last hand of the tournament, betting is the optimal play to maximize value and pressure your opponent, potentially securing the win.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The command to initiate betting with 80 chips is `[Bet 80]`.\n\n**Action**: `[Bet 80]`\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 10 / 10 - River =====\nPot: 240 | Current bet: 80\nVisible board: [8\u2665, K\u2665, 4\u2660, J\u2660, 8\u2663]\nP0 (SB): 640.00 chips | bet 80.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 1120.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 9\u2665, 10\u2660\n==============================================",
