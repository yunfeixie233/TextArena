I have already called 80 pre-flop and have 170 committed. It costs **70 more to call** (150 \u2212 80 = 70) or I can raise for maximized value.  \n\nPlan: Game-tree best in this OOP spot is to **check-raise** for full value and deny draws their equity.

The only hands that beat me are 6-6 (quad sixes) or K-K (kings full), both of which are impossible given the visible cards.\n\n- Villain called a huge flop raise, so their range is capped to hands like K-x, 6-x, or pocket pairs 77-TT.  \n- I\u2019m out of position, but with the stone-cold nuts and a pot already bloated to 1140, I want to get the rest of the money in.  \n- Any bet I make will leave a trivial amount behind, so shoving maximizes fold equity against draws and value from worse made hands.\n\nAction: [Bet 390]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 390.\n[Player 1] **Current Decision:**\n\n- Pot: 1530 chips  \n- Player 0 (SB) is all-in for 390 chips, and I (Player 1) have 470 chips remaining.  \n- My hand: 5\u2660 J\u2660, which currently gives me two pairs, but I have to evaluate the situation carefully against the possibility of Player 0 having a full house or better.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Player 0 has pushed all-in, which shows strength. The board shows two 6s and a King, representing potential straights or quads. However, I do still have two pairs.\n- I need to assess whether my two pairs are strong enough against Player 0's possible range.
