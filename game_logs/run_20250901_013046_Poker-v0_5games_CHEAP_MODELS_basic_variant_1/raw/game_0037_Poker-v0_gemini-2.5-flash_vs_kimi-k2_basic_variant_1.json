Force out all hands worse than ace-high.  \n2. Set up a river shove on certain run-outs.\n\nHowever, this turn (blank 8\u2660) improves very little of my range AND makes betting big/folding turns perilous. Meanwhile, I\u2019m out of position and have a capped/nuttier ratio\u2014while value portion wants to jam\u2013blend, my current bluffing range must tread carefully.\n\nAt 320 pot and 800 behind, firing again forces us into awkward pot-size if we get raised, or loses too much value if we check back with ace-high. We might get called by king/ pocket 8/4s. Since we are not facing a bet right now, checking to pot-control and preserve equity in my showdown-wager is very reasonable here. If river is safe (non-k/Ace-7 diamond, non-4) \u2014 we go check/ make thin river call based on bet size.  \n\nIn short, this isn\u2019t a textbook auto-bluff turn and satisfied enough to control costs with ace-high holdings.\n\n[Check]",

Force out all hands worse than ace-high.  \n2.

Meanwhile, I\u2019m out of position and have a capped/nuttier ratio\u2014while value portion wants to jam\u2013blend, my current bluffing range must tread carefully.\n\nAt 320 pot and 800 behind, firing again forces us into awkward pot-size if we get raised, or loses too much value if we check back with ace-high. We might get called by king/ pocket 8/4s. Since we are not facing a bet right now, checking to pot-control and preserve equity in my showdown-wager is very reasonable here. If river is safe (non-k/Ace-7 diamond, non-4) \u2014 we go check/ make thin river call based on bet size.  \n\nIn short, this isn\u2019t a textbook auto-bluff turn and satisfied enough to control costs with ace-high holdings.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2665, K\u2663, 4\u2666, 8\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 880.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2665, 5\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   [Bet 160]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 160.\n[Player 1] I\u2019m facing a 160-chip bet into a 480-chip pot on the turn.  \nI hold A\u2666 5\u2666 on the board 2\u2665 K\u2663 4\u2666 8\u2660.\n\nKey points:\n- My hand: Ace-high, no pair, no flush draw, dead 5 gives me ace-low one card.  \n- Pot odds: 480 \u2192 640, so I need 25 % equity vs his turn-betting range to call profitably.  \n- His line: pre-flop call out of position, flop call c-bet, turn 50 % pot.  \n  Typical ranges after this action contain lots of kings (Kx, K8, possibly slow-played 44-88), pocket pairs 66\u2013QQ, perhaps some floats like JT, QJ.  \n- Against that range our A-high is unlikely to have the required 25 % equity.  \n- Calling here risks facing a large river barrel; folding leaves us 880 chips (86 % of our original stack), which keeps us comfortable in the tournament.\n\nWith our equity so thin and no outs, folding is the disciplined play.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 480 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1100.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 870.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================",

King smashes villain\u2019s big-blind calling range.

Force out all hands worse than ace-high.  \n2. Set up a river shove on certain run-outs.\n\nHowever, this turn (blank 8\u2660) improves very little of my range AND makes betting big/folding turns perilous. Meanwhile, I\u2019m out of position and have a capped/nuttier ratio\u2014while value portion wants to jam\u2013blend, my current bluffing range must tread carefully.\n\nAt 320 pot and 800 behind, firing again forces us into awkward pot-size if we get raised, or loses too much value if we check back with ace-high. We might get called by king/ pocket 8/4s. Since we are not facing a bet right now, checking to pot-control and preserve equity in my showdown-wager is very reasonable here.

King smashes villain\u2019s big-blind calling range. Against a float-bet or a delayed c-bet, villain can easily hit or represent this king.\n\nWith 160 chips already in, and staying 880 deep, a small-to-medium c-bet is standard to balance value vs bluff. A sizing around 80-100 (half-pot to two-thirds pot) folds out non-king hands and charges draws while protecting certain portions of my range. 80 keeps pot under \u00bd effective stack for potential turn maneuvering.\n\n[Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 240 | Current bet: 80\nVisible board: [2\u2665, K\u2663, 4\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 880.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 880.00 chips | bet 80.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2665, 5\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   [Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 80.\n[Player 1]   \nTurn is 8\u2660 \u2013 another blank that doesn\u2019t change much.  \nBoard is now 2\u2665 K\u2663 4\u2666 8\u2660 (rainbow with a 1-liner to a wheel).  \nI still have A-high, no pair, no flush draw.  \nPot is 320 chips.  \nEffective stack behind: 800 chips (P0) and 880 chips (me).\n\nThe turn card favors my range as pre-flop aggressor (I can have more 8-kickers and all overpairs to the 8), but villain just defended flop with a call, so their range puts them in a spot to continue with a lot of kings, pocket pairs like 55-QQ, maybe floats like QJ/J10 etc.\n\nA second barrel needs to accomplish one of two things:\n1. Force out all hands worse than ace-high.  \n2. Set up a river shove on certain run-outs.\n\nHowever, this turn (blank 8\u2660) improves very little of my range AND makes betting big/folding turns perilous. Meanwhile, I\u2019m out of position and have a capped/nuttier ratio\u2014while value portion wants to jam\u2013blend, my current bluffing range must tread carefully.\n\nAt 320 pot and 800 behind, firing again forces us into awkward pot-size if we get raised, or loses too much value if we check back with ace-high. We might get called by king/ pocket 8/4s. Since we are not facing a bet right now, checking to pot-control and preserve equity in my showdown-wager is very reasonable here. If river is safe (non-k/Ace-7 diamond, non-4) \u2014 we go check/ make thin river call based on bet size.  \n\nIn short, this isn\u2019t a textbook auto-bluff turn and satisfied enough to control costs with ace-high holdings.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2665, K\u2663, 4\u2666, 8\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 880.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2665, 5\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   [Bet 160]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 160.\n[Player 1] I\u2019m facing a 160-chip bet into a 480-chip pot on the turn.  \nI hold A\u2666 5\u2666 on the board 2\u2665 K\u2663 4\u2666 8\u2660.\n\nKey points:\n- My hand: Ace-high, no pair, no flush draw, dead 5 gives me ace-low one card.  \n- Pot odds: 480 \u2192 640, so I need 25 % equity vs his turn-betting range to call profitably.  \n- His line: pre-flop call out of position, flop call c-bet, turn 50 % pot.  \n  Typical ranges after this action contain lots of kings (Kx, K8, possibly slow-played 44-88), pocket pairs 66\u2013QQ, perhaps some floats like JT, QJ.  \n- Against that range our A-high is unlikely to have the required 25 % equity.  \n- Calling here risks facing a large river barrel; folding leaves us 880 chips (86 % of our original stack), which keeps us comfortable in the tournament.\n\nWith our equity so thin and no outs, folding is the disciplined play.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 480 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1100.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 870.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  I am in the big blind with 4\u2666 2\u2666.

King smashes villain\u2019s big-blind calling range. Against a float-bet or a delayed c-bet, villain can easily hit or represent this king.\n\nWith 160 chips already in, and staying 880 deep, a small-to-medium c-bet is standard to balance value vs bluff.

Force out all hands worse than ace-high.  \n2. Set up a river shove on certain run-outs.\n\nHowever, this turn (blank 8\u2660) improves very little of my range AND makes betting big/folding turns perilous. Meanwhile, I\u2019m out of position and have a capped/nuttier ratio\u2014while value portion wants to jam\u2013blend, my current bluffing range must tread carefully.\n\nAt 320 pot and 800 behind, firing again forces us into awkward pot-size if we get raised, or loses too much value if we check back with ace-high. We might get called by king/ pocket 8/4s. Since we are not facing a bet right now, checking to pot-control and preserve equity in my showdown-wager is very reasonable here.

King smashes villain\u2019s big-blind calling range. Against a float-bet or a delayed c-bet, villain can easily hit or represent this king.\n\nWith 160 chips already in, and staying 880 deep, a small-to-medium c-bet is standard to balance value vs bluff. A sizing around 80-100 (half-pot to two-thirds pot) folds out non-king hands and charges draws while protecting certain portions of my range. 80 keeps pot under \u00bd effective stack for potential turn maneuvering.\n\n[Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[Player 0]   [Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2665, K\u2663, 4\u2666, 8\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 880.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2666, A\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]   \nTurn is 8\u2660 \u2013 another blank that doesn\u2019t change much.  \nBoard is now 2\u2665 K\u2663 4\u2666 8\u2660 (rainbow with a 1-liner to a wheel).  \nI still have A-high, no pair, no flush draw.  \nPot is 320 chips.  \nEffective stack behind: 800 chips (P0) and 880 chips (me).\n\nThe turn card favors my range as pre-flop aggressor (I can have more 8-kickers and all overpairs to the 8), but villain just defended flop with a call, so their range puts them in a spot to continue with a lot of kings, pocket pairs like 55-QQ, maybe floats like QJ/J10 etc.\n\nA second barrel needs to accomplish one of two things:\n1. Force out all hands worse than ace-high.  \n2. Set up a river shove on certain run-outs.\n\nHowever, this turn (blank 8\u2660) improves very little of my range AND makes betting big/folding turns perilous. Meanwhile, I\u2019m out of position and have a capped/nuttier ratio\u2014while value portion wants to jam\u2013blend, my current bluffing range must tread carefully.\n\nAt 320 pot and 800 behind, firing again forces us into awkward pot-size if we get raised, or loses too much value if we check back with ace-high. We might get called by king/ pocket 8/4s. Since we are not facing a bet right now, checking to pot-control and preserve equity in my showdown-wager is very reasonable here.

King smashes villain\u2019s big-blind calling range.

Force out all hands worse than ace-high.  \n2. Set up a river shove on certain run-outs.\n\nHowever, this turn (blank 8\u2660) improves very little of my range AND makes betting big/folding turns perilous. Meanwhile, I\u2019m out of position and have a capped/nuttier ratio\u2014while value portion wants to jam\u2013blend, my current bluffing range must tread carefully.\n\nAt 320 pot and 800 behind, firing again forces us into awkward pot-size if we get raised, or loses too much value if we check back with ace-high. We might get called by king/ pocket 8/4s. Since we are not facing a bet right now, checking to pot-control and preserve equity in my showdown-wager is very reasonable here.

King smashes villain\u2019s big-blind calling range. Against a float-bet or a delayed c-bet, villain can easily hit or represent this king.\n\nWith 160 chips already in, and staying 880 deep, a small-to-medium c-bet is standard to balance value vs bluff. A sizing around 80-100 (half-pot to two-thirds pot) folds out non-king hands and charges draws while protecting certain portions of my range. 80 keeps pot under \u00bd effective stack for potential turn maneuvering.\n\n[Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[Player 0]   [Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2665, K\u2663, 4\u2666, 8\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 880.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2666, A\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]   \nTurn is 8\u2660 \u2013 another blank that doesn\u2019t change much.  \nBoard is now 2\u2665 K\u2663 4\u2666 8\u2660 (rainbow with a 1-liner to a wheel).  \nI still have A-high, no pair, no flush draw.  \nPot is 320 chips.  \nEffective stack behind: 800 chips (P0) and 880 chips (me).\n\nThe turn card favors my range as pre-flop aggressor (I can have more 8-kickers and all overpairs to the 8), but villain just defended flop with a call, so their range puts them in a spot to continue with a lot of kings, pocket pairs like 55-QQ, maybe floats like QJ/J10 etc.\n\nA second barrel needs to accomplish one of two things:\n1. Force out all hands worse than ace-high.  \n2. Set up a river shove on certain run-outs.\n\nHowever, this turn (blank 8\u2660) improves very little of my range AND makes betting big/folding turns perilous. Meanwhile, I\u2019m out of position and have a capped/nuttier ratio\u2014while value portion wants to jam\u2013blend, my current bluffing range must tread carefully.\n\nAt 320 pot and 800 behind, firing again forces us into awkward pot-size if we get raised, or loses too much value if we check back with ace-high. We might get called by king/ pocket 8/4s. Since we are not facing a bet right now, checking to pot-control and preserve equity in my showdown-wager is very reasonable here.

Force out all hands worse than ace-high.  \n2. Set up a river shove on certain run-outs.\n\nHowever, this turn (blank 8\u2660) improves very little of my range AND makes betting big/folding turns perilous. Meanwhile, I\u2019m out of position and have a capped/nuttier ratio\u2014while value portion wants to jam\u2013blend, my current bluffing range must tread carefully.\n\nAt 320 pot and 800 behind, firing again forces us into awkward pot-size if we get raised, or loses too much value if we check back with ace-high. We might get called by king/ pocket 8/4s. Since we are not facing a bet right now, checking to pot-control and preserve equity in my showdown-wager is very reasonable here.

King smashes villain\u2019s big-blind calling range. Against a float-bet or a delayed c-bet, villain can easily hit or represent this king.\n\nWith 160 chips already in, and staying 880 deep, a small-to-medium c-bet is standard to balance value vs bluff. A sizing around 80-100 (half-pot to two-thirds pot) folds out non-king hands and charges draws while protecting certain portions of my range. 80 keeps pot under \u00bd effective stack for potential turn maneuvering.\n\n[Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[Player 0]   [Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2665, K\u2663, 4\u2666, 8\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 880.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2666, A\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1]   \nTurn is 8\u2660 \u2013 another blank that doesn\u2019t change much.  \nBoard is now 2\u2665 K\u2663 4\u2666 8\u2660 (rainbow with a 1-liner to a wheel).  \nI still have A-high, no pair, no flush draw.  \nPot is 320 chips.  \nEffective stack behind: 800 chips (P0) and 880 chips (me).\n\nThe turn card favors my range as pre-flop aggressor (I can have more 8-kickers and all overpairs to the 8), but villain just defended flop with a call, so their range puts them in a spot to continue with a lot of kings, pocket pairs like 55-QQ, maybe floats like QJ/J10 etc.\n\nA second barrel needs to accomplish one of two things:\n1. Force out all hands worse than ace-high.  \n2. Set up a river shove on certain run-outs.\n\nHowever, this turn (blank 8\u2660) improves very little of my range AND makes betting big/folding turns perilous. Meanwhile, I\u2019m out of position and have a capped/nuttier ratio\u2014while value portion wants to jam\u2013blend, my current bluffing range must tread carefully.\n\nAt 320 pot and 800 behind, firing again forces us into awkward pot-size if we get raised, or loses too much value if we check back with ace-high. We might get called by king/ pocket 8/4s. Since we are not facing a bet right now, checking to pot-control and preserve equity in my showdown-wager is very reasonable here.

Pros: picks up pot outright ~48-55 % of the time (if villain folds top-pair plus pocket pairs <K), plus insane added EV if called and brick or I hit.  \n\nHalf-pot to 2/3-pot sizing:  \nTarget \u2248 55-65 chips which is ~70 % pot.  \nBut I want a slightly foldable turn with river stack for shove.

King smashes villain\u2019s big-blind calling range. Against a float-bet or a delayed c-bet, villain can easily hit or represent this king.\n\nWith 160 chips already in, and staying 880 deep, a small-to-medium c-bet is standard to balance value vs bluff. A sizing around 80-100 (half-pot to two-thirds pot) folds out non-king hands and charges draws while protecting certain portions of my range. 80 keeps pot under \u00bd effective stack for potential turn maneuvering.\n\n[Bet 80]\n[GAME] Player 1 bets to 80.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Flop =====\nPot: 240 | Current bet: 80\nVisible board: [2\u2665, K\u2663, 4\u2666]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 880.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 880.00 chips | bet 80.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2665, 5\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   [Call]\n[GAME] Player 0 calls 80.\n[Player 1]   \nTurn is 8\u2660 \u2013 another blank that doesn\u2019t change much.  \nBoard is now 2\u2665 K\u2663 4\u2666 8\u2660 (rainbow with a 1-liner to a wheel).  \nI still have A-high, no pair, no flush draw.  \nPot is 320 chips.  \nEffective stack behind: 800 chips (P0) and 880 chips (me).\n\nThe turn card favors my range as pre-flop aggressor (I can have more 8-kickers and all overpairs to the 8), but villain just defended flop with a call, so their range puts them in a spot to continue with a lot of kings, pocket pairs like 55-QQ, maybe floats like QJ/J10 etc.\n\nA second barrel needs to accomplish one of two things:\n1. Force out all hands worse than ace-high.  \n2. Set up a river shove on certain run-outs.\n\nHowever, this turn (blank 8\u2660) improves very little of my range AND makes betting big/folding turns perilous. Meanwhile, I\u2019m out of position and have a capped/nuttier ratio\u2014while value portion wants to jam\u2013blend, my current bluffing range must tread carefully.\n\nAt 320 pot and 800 behind, firing again forces us into awkward pot-size if we get raised, or loses too much value if we check back with ace-high. We might get called by king/ pocket 8/4s. Since we are not facing a bet right now, checking to pot-control and preserve equity in my showdown-wager is very reasonable here. If river is safe (non-k/Ace-7 diamond, non-4) \u2014 we go check/ make thin river call based on bet size.  \n\nIn short, this isn\u2019t a textbook auto-bluff turn and satisfied enough to control costs with ace-high holdings.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2665, K\u2663, 4\u2666, 8\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 880.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2665, 5\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   [Bet 160]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 160.\n[Player 1] I\u2019m facing a 160-chip bet into a 480-chip pot on the turn.  \nI hold A\u2666 5\u2666 on the board 2\u2665 K\u2663 4\u2666 8\u2660.\n\nKey points:\n- My hand: Ace-high, no pair, no flush draw, dead 5 gives me ace-low one card.  \n- Pot odds: 480 \u2192 640, so I need 25 % equity vs his turn-betting range to call profitably.  \n- His line: pre-flop call out of position, flop call c-bet, turn 50 % pot.  \n  Typical ranges after this action contain lots of kings (Kx, K8, possibly slow-played 44-88), pocket pairs 66\u2013QQ, perhaps some floats like JT, QJ.  \n- Against that range our A-high is unlikely to have the required 25 % equity.  \n- Calling here risks facing a large river barrel; folding leaves us 880 chips (86 % of our original stack), which keeps us comfortable in the tournament.\n\nWith our equity so thin and no outs, folding is the disciplined play.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 480 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1100.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 870.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  I am in the big blind with 4\u2666 2\u2666.

Force out all hands worse than ace-high.  \n2. Set up a river shove on certain run-outs.\n\nHowever, this turn (blank 8\u2660) improves very little of my range AND makes betting big/folding turns perilous.

We might get called by king/ pocket 8/4s. Since we are not facing a bet right now, checking to pot-control and preserve equity in my showdown-wager is very reasonable here. If river is safe (non-k/Ace-7 diamond, non-4) \u2014 we go check/ make thin river call based on bet size.  \n\nIn short, this isn\u2019t a textbook auto-bluff turn and satisfied enough to control costs with ace-high holdings.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 320 | Current bet: 0\nVisible board: [2\u2665, K\u2663, 4\u2666, 8\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 800.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 880.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 3\u2665, 5\u2663\n==============================================\n[Player 0]   [Bet 160]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 160.\n[Player 1] I\u2019m facing a 160-chip bet into a 480-chip pot on the turn.  \nI hold A\u2666 5\u2666 on the board 2\u2665 K\u2663 4\u2666 8\u2660.\n\nKey points:\n- My hand: Ace-high, no pair, no flush draw, dead 5 gives me ace-low one card.  \n- Pot odds: 480 \u2192 640, so I need 25 % equity vs his turn-betting range to call profitably.  \n- His line: pre-flop call out of position, flop call c-bet, turn 50 % pot.  \n  Typical ranges after this action contain lots of kings (Kx, K8, possibly slow-played 44-88), pocket pairs 66\u2013QQ, perhaps some floats like JT, QJ.  \n- Against that range our A-high is unlikely to have the required 25 % equity.  \n- Calling here risks facing a large river barrel; folding leaves us 880 chips (86 % of our original stack), which keeps us comfortable in the tournament.\n\nWith our equity so thin and no outs, folding is the disciplined play.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 480 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1100.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 870.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: 4\u2666, 2\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  I am in the big blind with 4\u2666 2\u2666.

Meanwhile, I\u2019m out of position and have a capped/nuttier ratio\u2014while value portion wants to jam\u2013blend, my current bluffing range must tread carefully.\n\nAt 320 pot and 800 behind, firing again forces us into awkward pot-size if we get raised, or loses too much value if we check back with ace-high. We might get called by king/ pocket 8/4s. Since we are not facing a bet right now, checking to pot-control and preserve equity in my showdown-wager is very reasonable here. If river is safe (non-k/Ace-7 diamond, non-4) \u2014 we go check/ make thin river call based on bet size.  \n\nIn short, this isn\u2019t a textbook auto-bluff turn and satisfied enough to control costs with ace-high holdings.\n\n[Check]\n[GAME] Player 1 checks.\n[Player 0]   [Bet 160]\n[GAME] Player 0 bets to 160.\n[GAME] ===== Hand 7 / 10 - Turn =====\nPot: 480 | Current bet: 160\nVisible board: [2\u2665, K\u2663, 4\u2666, 8\u2660]\nP0 (Dealer/BB): 640.00 chips | bet 160.00 | active\nP1 (SB): 880.00 chips | bet 0.00 | active\nYour hole: 5\u2666, A\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 1] I\u2019m facing a 160-chip bet into a 480-chip pot on the turn.  \nI hold A\u2666 5\u2666 on the board 2\u2665 K\u2663 4\u2666 8\u2660.\n\nKey points:\n- My hand: Ace-high, no pair, no flush draw, dead 5 gives me ace-low one card.  \n- Pot odds: 480 \u2192 640, so I need 25 % equity vs his turn-betting range to call profitably.  \n- His line: pre-flop call out of position, flop call c-bet, turn 50 % pot.  \n  Typical ranges after this action contain lots of kings (Kx, K8, possibly slow-played 44-88), pocket pairs 66\u2013QQ, perhaps some floats like JT, QJ.  \n- Against that range our A-high is unlikely to have the required 25 % equity.  \n- Calling here risks facing a large river barrel; folding leaves us 880 chips (86 % of our original stack), which keeps us comfortable in the tournament.\n\nWith our equity so thin and no outs, folding is the disciplined play.\n\n[Fold]\n[GAME] Player 1 folds.\n[GAME] Player 0 wins the pot of 480 chips (all others folded).\n[GAME] ===== Hand 8 / 10 - Pre\u2011flop =====\nPot: 30 | Current bet: 20\nVisible board: []\nP0 (SB): 1100.00 chips | bet 20.00 | active\nP1 (Dealer/BB): 870.00 chips | bet 10.00 | active\nYour hole: K\u2666, 3\u2666\n==============================================\n[Player 0]  I am in the big blind with 4\u2666 2\u2666.

No, wheel is ace-to-five. I already have 4, 6, 7 on board. Need 5 to complete straight A-5.

With stack-to-pot ratios of about 10:1, 50 %\u201360 % pot is reasonable. Pros: picks up pot outright ~48-55 % of the time (if villain folds top-pair plus pocket pairs <K), plus insane added EV if called and brick or I hit.  \n\nHalf-pot to 2/3-pot sizing:  \nTarget \u2248 55-65 chips which is ~70 % pot.  \nBut I want a slightly foldable turn with river stack for shove.
