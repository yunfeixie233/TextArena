My most plentiful commodity is Ore (9 units @ 39 each), and while it\u2019s tempting to hoard it, its high value also means that even a small percentage gain on a deal will dwarf the gains I could make on other resources.\n\nHowever, I notice I\u2019m comparatively short on Sheep (5 @ 14) and Wheat (7 @ 5). Both are modest per-unit, but together they could power a lot of future trading leverage\u2014especially Wheat, which typically moves in bigger bundles.\n\nLet\u2019s put something on the table that (1) looks generous, (2) still adds value to me, and (3) tempts my opponent to give up quantities they may later regret parting with.\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 10 Wheat, 5 Sheep]",

      "response": "Let me quickly audit my new stockpile (after the only accepted trade so far):\n\nCurrent reserves\n- Wheat: 7 \u2013 5 given away = 2   (value 5 each \u2192 2\u00d75 = 10)\n- Wood: 6                     (value 12 each \u2192 6\u00d712 = 72)\n- Sheep: 5                    (value 14 each \u2192 5\u00d714 = 70)\n- Brick: 8 \u2013 3 given away = 5 (value 21 each \u2192 5\u00d721 = 105)\n- Ore: 9 + 1 received = 10    (value 39 each \u2192 10\u00d739 = 390)\n\nTotal stockpile value \u2248 10 + 72 + 70 + 105 + 390 = 647 points.\n\nThat is already an excellent value concentration around the high-unit-price Ore.  \nBricks are now moderate value per unit; I won\u2019t hurt much giving up more.  \nWood and especially Sheep are the tightest quantities, so limiting how many get away is key.\n\nIntent: acquire another 1\u20132 Ore (to really corner the top-value resource) while shedding the lowest-value Wheat and excess Brick lightly. Because Player 1 keeps rejecting ore-chunk demands directly, a smaller, balanced offer should be more tempting.\n\n[Offer: 3 Brick, 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore, 2 Wheat]",
