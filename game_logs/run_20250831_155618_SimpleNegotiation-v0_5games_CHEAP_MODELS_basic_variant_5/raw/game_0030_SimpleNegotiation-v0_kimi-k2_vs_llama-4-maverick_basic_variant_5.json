      "response": "To determine the next move, let's first update the current resource reserves after the last accepted trade.\n\nInitial Resources:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 14   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 19   Value: 9\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 12   Value: 13\n- [Brick]   Qty: 11   Value: 29\n- [Ore]     Qty: 17   Value: 40\n\nAfter accepting the trade with Player 0 (3 Brick, 1 Ore -> 8 Wheat, 3 Wood):\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 14 + 8 = 22\n- [Wood]    Qty: 19 + 3 = 22\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 12 (no change)\n- [Brick]   Qty: 11 - 3 = 8\n- [Ore]     Qty: 17 - 1 = 16\n\nAfter the subsequent trade (5 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Sheep, 1 Brick):\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 22 - 5 = 17\n- [Wood]    Qty: 22 - 4 = 18\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 12 + 2 = 14\n- [Brick]   Qty: 8 + 1 = 9\n- [Ore]     Qty: 16 (no change)\n\nCurrent Resources:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 17   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 18   Value: 9\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 14   Value: 13\n- [Brick]   Qty: 9   Value: 29\n- [Ore]     Qty: 16   Value: 40\n\nLet's assess the current situation and think about a strategic move. The goal is to amplify the total value of the resource stockpile.\n\n1. **Current Total Value**:\n   - Wheat: 17 * 5 = 85\n   - Wood: 18 * 9 = 162\n   - Sheep: 14 * 13 = 182\n   - Brick: 9 * 29 = 261\n   - Ore: 16 * 40 = 640\n   - Total Value = 85 + 162 + 182 + 261 + 640 = 1330\n\n2. **Strategy**: Focus on resources with higher value or those that are likely to be in demand (and thus can be traded for higher value resources).\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- Ore is the highest value resource, and we have a substantial quantity. Trading some Ore for other resources might not be optimal unless it significantly increases our total value.\n- Brick is also valuable. We have reduced our Brick quantity significantly due to the first trade but still have some.\n- We have increased our Wheat and Wood quantities, which can potentially be traded for more valuable resources.\n\nConsidering the current quantities and values, a potential trade could involve offering Wheat and/or Wood for Sheep, Brick, or Ore, as they are more valuable.\n\nGiven that Player 0 made no new trade offer last turn, it's likely they are waiting for a proposal. Let's make a strategic offer.\n\n**Action**:\nLet's propose a trade that offers resources with lower to moderate value for those with higher value. Considering our quantities and the values, we can offer some Wheat and Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Brick]\n\nThis trade gives away:\n- 4 Wheat = 4 * 5 = 20 value\n- 5 Wood = 5 * 9 = 45 value\nTotal given away = 20 + 45 = 65 value\n\nIn return, we get:\n- 3 Brick = 3 * 29 = 87 value\n\nThis seems like a positive trade as we gain 87 - 65 = 22 value.\n\nLet's make the offer: \n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 3 Brick]",
