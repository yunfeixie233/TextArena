Getting more Sheep would be advantageous as it is a high-value resource.

Having fewer Sheep might limit some trade opportunities, but gaining a Brick is relatively neutral in terms of overall value.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer that's more favorable. To make a clever trade, I'll think about what I can offer that is of relatively lower value to me but could be of higher value or at least acceptable to Player0.\n\nSince I've just lost 2 Sheep, making another offer involving Sheep might not be the best. Let's consider other resources.\n\nGiven my current stockpile, I'll make a new offer: [Offer:2 Wheat,1 Ore ->3 Brick,1 Sheep]. The idea is to gain more Brick (a valuable resource) and potentially regain a Sheep, while giving away resources that, although valuable, are relatively less so in comparison or are available in decent quantities.\n\nMy action is: [Offer:2 Wheat,1 Ore ->3 Brick,1 Sheep]",
