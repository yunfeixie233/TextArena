We should aim to gain resources with higher value while giving away those with lower value.\n\nGiven the current quantities and values:\n- The total value of resources = (10*5) + (12*12) + (21*13) + (12*29) + (16*35) = 50 + 144 + 273 + 348 + 560 = 1375\n\nTo make a strategic move, let's consider what we can offer that involves resources with lower value and request resources with higher value.\n\nConsidering the last rejected offer and our current state, a potential new offer could involve giving away some Wheat and/or Wood (lower value compared to Brick and Ore) to gain Brick or Ore.\n\nLet's propose a new trade that gives away 3 Wood (Value: 12*3 = 36) and 2 Sheep (Value: 13*2 = 26), totaling 62 in value, to gain 2 Ore (Value: 35*2 = 70), which is a gain of 8 in total value.\n\nThus, a new offer could be: [Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\n\n'[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]'",
