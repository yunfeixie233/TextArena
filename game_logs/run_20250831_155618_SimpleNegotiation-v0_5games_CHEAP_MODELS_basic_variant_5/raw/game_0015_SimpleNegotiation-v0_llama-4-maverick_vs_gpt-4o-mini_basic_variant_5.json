We have relatively low quantities of Brick and Ore, which are high-value resources. Let's consider making an offer that could potentially increase our total value.\n\n### Proposed Trade\n\nWe can offer resources that are less valuable or surplus to our needs in exchange for higher-value resources or more quantities of resources that are valuable.\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (low value/unit) in exchange for more Brick or Ore, or other valuable resources.\n\n### Action\n\nLet's make an initial offer to start negotiations. We can propose:\n'[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]'\n\nThis trade involves giving up 8 Wheat (40 value) to gain 1 Brick (29 value) and 1 Ore (33 value), resulting in a net gain of 22 value.\n\nLet's see the response from the adversary and proceed accordingly.\n\n**Action:** '[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]'",

To continue this trend, we need to analyze the current reserves and think about what Player 1 might be willing to trade.\n\nGiven the current reserves and values, a logical step is to look for opportunities that could further increase the total value. Since Brick and Ore have high values and we've just gained some, we should be cautious about giving them away too quickly.\n\nNoticing that Wheat is the least valuable resource and we have reduced our quantity to 12, we should avoid trading away more Wheat unless we get something significantly valuable in return.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n\n1. We could offer some Wheat or Wood (since they are relatively less valuable compared to others) in exchange for more valuable resources.\n   \n2. Given that we now have more Brick and Ore, we could potentially offer some of these in exchange for a significant quantity of a less valuable resource or another valuable resource.\n\nLet's propose a trade that could be beneficial:\n\nWe have a surplus of Wheat relative to its value and could trade some away. Let's offer 5 Wheat (Value = 25) for 1 Sheep (Value = 18). Although this seems like we're losing value (since 25 > 18), it's a relatively balanced trade that doesn't drastically reduce our total value but could be a good starting point.\n\n### Proposed Trade:\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds.\n\n### Action:\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`",

      "response": "### Current Resource Reserves:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 20 - 8 - 5 - 3 - 2 = 2,   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 11 + 3 = 14,   Value: 9\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 10 - 1 = 9,   Value: 18\n- [Brick]   Qty: 6 + 1 = 7,   Value: 29\n- [Ore]     Qty: 7 + 1 - 1 = 7,   Value: 33\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Remaining Turns:** 5 turns left.\n2. **Resource Distribution:** After the last transaction, we have 2 Wheat, 14 Wood, 9 Sheep, 7 Brick, and 7 Ore.\n3. **Value Calculation:** \n   - Wheat: 2 * 5 = 10\n   - Wood: 14 * 9 = 126\n   - Sheep: 9 * 18 = 162\n   - Brick: 7 * 29 = 203\n   - Ore: 7 * 33 = 231\n   - Total Value = 10 + 126 + 162 + 203 + 231 = 732\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nTo maximize the total value, we should look to trade resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable or at least maintain our current value while optimizing our resource distribution for potential future trades.\n\n### Proposed Trade:\nSince we have a good distribution of resources and a significant amount of valuable resources (Brick and Ore), we should look to either maintain or slightly improve our current total value. \n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of our less valuable resources (relative to others like Ore and Brick) to see if we can gain more valuable resources.\n\n### Action:\nLet's consider offering some Wood (Value: 9) for a more valuable resource. Given that we already have a decent amount of Brick and Ore, we need to be cautious. \n\nMaking an offer: `[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Sheep]` is not beneficial since Sheep is more valuable than Wood, but we already have a good number of Sheep.\n\nLet's directly analyze the possibility of trading some of our less valuable resources:\n- `[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]` would mean giving up (2*9) + (1*5) = 18 + 5 = 23 for 29, which is a gain.\n\nThus, the action will be: `[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\n### Move:\n`[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`",
