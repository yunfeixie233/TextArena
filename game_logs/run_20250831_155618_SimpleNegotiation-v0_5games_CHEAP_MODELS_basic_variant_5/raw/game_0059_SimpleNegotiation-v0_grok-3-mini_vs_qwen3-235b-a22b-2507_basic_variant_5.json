      "response": "[Deny]  \n\n**Rationale**:  \n- **Value Analysis**:  \n  - Surrendering 3 Ore (value: 3 \u00d7 39 = **117**) results in a significant loss of high-value resources.  \n  - Gaining 10 Wheat (10 \u00d7 6 = 60) and 2 Wood (2 \u00d7 11 = 22) adds only **82** total value.  \n  - **Net change**: -117 + 82 = **-35 value** (net loss).  \n- **Strategic Risk**:  \n  - Ore is Player 1's most valuable resource (39/unit). Sacrificing 21.4% of Ore reserves (3 of 14) for lower-tier resources (Wheat/Value 6, Wood/Value 11) weakens long-term leverage.  \n  - Player 1\u2019s current high-value reserves (Brick/Ore) should be protected for targetable trades later in the game (e.g., to acquire undervalued Sheep or Brick for value spikes).  \n- **Opportunity Cost**:  \n  - Accepting this sets a precedent for unfavorable trades. Denying forces Player 0 to improve future offers, especially as scarcity of Ore deepens over turns.  \n- **Conclusion**:  \n  Immediate loss of value, asymmetric resource depletion, and better potential opportunities later justify denial. Player 1 maintains a strong reserve position (current total value: **1,229**) for turn 2 counterproposals.",
