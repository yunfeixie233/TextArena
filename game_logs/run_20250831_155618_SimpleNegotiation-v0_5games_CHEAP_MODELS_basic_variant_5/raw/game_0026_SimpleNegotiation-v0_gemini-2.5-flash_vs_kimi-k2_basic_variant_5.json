      "response": "I can see that Player 0 keeps repeating the same rejected trade. Let me assess my current reserves from the previous info.\n\nMy current reserves after the last trade are:\n- Wheat: updated from earlier trades (starting 6, then gained 8 in first trade)\n- Wood: updated from earlier trades (starting 6, then gained 3 in first trade, then gained 10 in second trade)\n- Sheep: starting 11, traded 5 away in second trade, but didn't accept the last trades\n- Brick: started at 20, traded away 1 in first and 1 in second, so ~18 left\n- Ore: started at 5, traded away 1 in first trade, so ~4 left\n\nI'll evaluate this latest offer:\n\nOffer: 5 Sheep, 5 Wood -> 1 Brick\n\nSheep value is 15/11 = 1.36 per unit\nWood value is 10/6 = 1.67 per unit  \nBrick value is 28/20 = 1.4 per unit\n\nOn surface, 5 Sheep + 5 Wood = 6.8 + 8.35 = 15.15 value for 1 Brick = 1.4 value. That's poor.\n\nBut actually looking at the numbers, I don't appear to have received any Sheep or Wood in recent trades to give away 5 each. Looking more carefully at the history:\n\n- I accepted 8 Wheat and 3 Wood in the first trade from Player 0\n- I accepted 10 Wood and 5 Sheep in the second trade from Player 0\n- I rejected all other offers involving Sheep/Wood\n\nThis suggests Player 0 is now trying to get back some of the Sheep/Wood it traded to me earlier by offering very unfavorable deals. I should reject this.\n\n[Deny]",
