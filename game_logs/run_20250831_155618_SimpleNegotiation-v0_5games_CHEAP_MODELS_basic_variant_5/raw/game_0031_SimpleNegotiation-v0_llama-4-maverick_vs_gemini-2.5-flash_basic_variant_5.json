      "response": "To start, let's assess the current situation and plan a strategy. \n\n## Step 1: Evaluate Current Resources and Their Values\nI have the following resources with their respective quantities and values:\n- Wheat: Qty = 7, Value = 5\n- Wood: Qty = 6, Value = 11\n- Sheep: Qty = 21, Value = 18\n- Brick: Qty = 8, Value = 20\n- Ore: Qty = 14, Value = 39\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Total Value of Current Resources\nTo understand my starting position, I'll calculate the total value of my resources.\n- Total Value = (7 * 5) + (6 * 11) + (21 * 18) + (8 * 20) + (14 * 39)\n- Total Value = 35 + 66 + 378 + 160 + 546\n- Total Value = 1185\n\n## Step 3: Identify Resources to Potentially Trade\nGiven the values, Ore and Sheep are my most valuable resources in terms of total value due to their high quantity and value per unit. Brick, despite having a high value per unit, is less abundant. Wheat has the lowest value per unit.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate an Initial Trade Proposal\nTo make a clever trade, I should offer resources that are less valuable to me or abundant and ask for resources that could either be valuable or are needed in a higher quantity. Since Wheat is the least valuable per unit and I have a moderate quantity of it, I can consider offering it. I also have a relatively low quantity of Wood compared to its value per unit, so gaining more Wood could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 5: Propose a Trade\nLet's propose a trade that gives away some Wheat (since it's the least valuable per unit) and possibly another less critical resource for something more valuable or needed. \nI'll offer: '[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 4 Wood, 1 Brick]'.\n\nThis trade gives away:\n- 4 Wheat = 4 * 5 = 20 value\n- 2 Sheep = 2 * 18 = 36 value\nTotal given away = 20 + 36 = 56 value\n\nIn return, I gain:\n- 4 Wood = 4 * 11 = 44 value\n- 1 Brick = 1 * 20 = 20 value\nTotal gained = 44 + 20 = 64 value\n\nThis results in a net gain of 64 - 56 = 8 value.\n\n## Step 6: Make the Trade Proposal\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 4 Wood, 1 Brick]'.\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response. \n\nSince the format requires a specific action and the problem doesn't directly ask for a numerical answer but rather a trade action, the response will be directly related to the game's action format.\n\nThe final answer is: '[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 4 Wood, 1 Brick]'",

Player 0 offered 4 Wheat, 2 Sheep for 4 Wood, 1 Brick. Player 1 rejected.\n2. Player 0 offered 5 Sheep for 2 Brick, 1 Ore. Player 1 rejected.\n\n#### Considerations for Next Move:\n- The value of the resources Player 0 is offering seems to be undervalued compared to what is being requested, based on the given values.\n- Player 1 is not making counteroffers, suggesting they might be waiting for a more favorable offer or have a specific strategy in mind.\n\n#### Strategy:\nTo outperform Player 1, we need to either:\n1. Make a trade that significantly increases the total value of our resources.\n2. Conserve resources if the trades offered do not favor us.\n\n#### New Offer:\nLet's reassess the values and make a more strategic offer. \n\nGiven:\n- [Sheep] Value: 18, Qty: 21\n- [Brick] Value: 20, Qty: 8\n- [Ore]   Value: 39, Qty: 14\n\nTo gain more value, let's offer some Sheep for Ore, as Ore is highly valued.\n\n#### Proposed Trade:\n Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore\n\n Calculation:\n- Offering 4 Sheep = 4 * (18/21) = approximately 3.43 value units (normalized per unit)\n- Requesting 1 Ore = 39/14 = approximately 2.79 value units (normalized per unit)\n\nHowever, considering the absolute values and the need to make a compelling trade:\n- 4 Sheep = 4 * 18 = 72 value points\n- 1 Ore = 39 value points\n\nTo make it more appealing and balanced, let's adjust the offer:\n- Offer 3 Sheep (Value: 54) for 1 Ore (Value: 39).

Currently, the total value is calculated as follows:\n   - Wheat: 3 * 5 = 15\n   - Wood: 6 * 11 = 66\n   - Sheep: 16 * 18 = 288\n   - Brick: 9 * 20 = 180\n   - Ore: 14 * 39 = 546\n   - Total Value = 15 + 66 + 288 + 180 + 546 = 1095\n\n2. **Trade History**:\n   - Offered 4 Wheat, 2 Sheep for 4 Wood, 1 Brick (Rejected)\n   - Offered 5 Sheep for 2 Brick, 1 Ore (Rejected)\n   - Offered 3 Sheep for 1 Ore (Accepted)\n   - Offered 4 Sheep for 2 Wood, 1 Brick (Rejected)\n\n3. **Next Move**:\n   To decide the next move, we should analyze what resources are valuable and what we can afford to give away. Since Ore has the highest value and we still have a considerable amount of it, we should avoid giving it away unless absolutely necessary. We also have a good amount of Sheep, which we have been using for trades.\n\n   Our last successful trade gave us 1 Ore in exchange for 3 Sheep. The rejected trades indicate that Player 1 is not willing to give away Wood or Brick easily, but we were able to get Ore for Sheep.\n\n   Let's consider a trade that could potentially benefit us. Since we have a substantial quantity of Sheep and the value is considerable, we can think about using Sheep for a trade again.\n\n   A potential trade could involve giving away some Sheep for a resource that either has a higher value or is scarce but useful. Let's aim to get more Brick or Ore, as they are high in value.\n\n#### Proposed Trade:\nConsidering our resources and the goal to increase our total value, let's propose a trade that gives us more Brick or keeps our Ore quantity stable while gaining something valuable.\n\nLet's offer: `[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis trade is reasonable because:\n- We are giving away 2 Sheep, which is a relatively lower value compared to Brick (2*18 = 36 vs 1*20 = 20).\n- We are getting 1 Brick in return, which maintains our strategy of acquiring high-value resources.\n\n**Action**:\n`[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]`\n\nLet's wait for Player 1's response.",
