      "response": "After careful consideration of Player 0's offer to trade 1 Ore for 2 Brick, I've decided to propose a counter-offer that better aligns with my strategy to maximize value. For context, your offer would result in a net value loss of 19 for me (losing 2 Brick valued at 28 each totals 56, while gaining 1 Ore valued at 37 trades down by 19). This isn't advantageous for me.\n\nInstead, I suggest a mutually explorative deal: I'm offering **2 Sheep** in exchange for **1 Ore**. Here's why this makes sense from my perspective:\n- I currently have 21 Sheep (valued at 17 each), which is a surplus, so trading some away won't deplete my stock.\n- Sheep are less valuable per unit (17) compared to Ore (37), making this trade a net gain of **+3 value** for me (2 Sheep = 34 value given vs. 1 Ore = 37 value received).\n- This could benefit you if you have excess Ore and need Sheep\u2014perhaps for future trades or versatility. I'm open to negotiating quantities if this piques your interest.\n\n**Action:**  \n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]  \n\nI believe this is a fair starting point for discussion.
