      "response": "### Initial Assessment\n\nTo start, I'll assess my current resource reserves and their total value:\n\n- Wheat: 11 units * 5 = 55\n- Wood: 19 units * 10 = 190\n- Sheep: 15 units * 17 = 255\n- Brick: 14 units * 22 = 308\n- Ore: 14 units * 36 = 504\n\nTotal Value = 55 + 190 + 255 + 308 + 504 = 1312\n\n### Strategy\n\nMy goal is to maximize the total value of my resources through strategic trades. Given the current distribution, I should look for opportunities to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones or to consolidate resources that are likely to be in demand.\n\n### First Turn\n\nSince it's the beginning of the game, I'll start by making an initial offer to gauge the opponent's interest and potentially gain an advantageous trade. I notice that I have a significant amount of Ore, which is the highest value resource. I should be cautious not to give away too much Ore. However, I also have a considerable amount of Brick, which is the next highest value resource.\n\nLet's start with an offer that gives away some of my lower-value resources in exchange for Brick or Ore, but since I already have a lot of Ore and Brick, I'll aim to get something valuable. Let's try to offer Wheat and Wood for Sheep or Brick.\n\n### Offer\n\nI'll make the following offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Sheep]`\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (5*5) + (3*10) = 25 + 30 = 55 for Wheat and Wood, and gains resources worth (2*22) + (1*17) = 44 + 17 = 61 for Brick and Sheep. It's a slightly favorable trade in terms of value.\n\nLet's see how the opponent responds. \n\n**Awaiting Response...**",

However, we need to be cautious about depleting our resources too much, especially those that are of high value or utility in future trades.\n\n### Potential Next Moves:\n1. **Evaluate Current Holdings:** \n   - We have a good amount of Ore and Brick now, which are high-value resources.\n   - We still have a considerable amount of Wood.\n   - Wheat is relatively low.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Trades:**\n   - Since we have more Ore and Brick now, we might look to trade some of these for resources that are more abundant for us but still valuable, or for resources that we are running low on.\n\n3. **Consider Player 1's Perspective:**\n   - Player 1 gave away 2 Ore and 1 Brick for 4 Wheat and 4 Wood. They might be looking to acquire more high-value resources or are trying to even out their resource distribution.\n\n### Proposed Trade:\nLet's propose a trade that leverages our current holdings and aims to further improve our resource value or diversity.\n\nWe can offer some of our Wood (since we have a lot) and possibly some Wheat (since its value is relatively low) to get more Sheep or possibly more Ore/Brick if possible.\n\n### Specific Trade Proposal:\nConsidering our current resources and the goal to outperform, let's make a trade offer.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 3 Sheep, 1 Ore]\n\nThis trade gives away resources of relatively lower value (Wood and Wheat) for resources that are either high in value (Ore) or complement our existing stockpile (Sheep).\n\nLet's execute this move.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 3 Sheep, 1 Ore]",
