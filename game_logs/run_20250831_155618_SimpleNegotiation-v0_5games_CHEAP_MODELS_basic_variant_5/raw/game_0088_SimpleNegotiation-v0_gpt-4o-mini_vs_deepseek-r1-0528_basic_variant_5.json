      "response": "Based on your current resource stockpile and trade dynamics, here\u2019s how you can proceed:\n\n1. **Evaluate Your Resources**:\n   - Wheat: 12\n   - Wood: 21\n   - Sheep: 13\n   - Brick: 12\n   - Ore: 15\n\n2. **Consider Player 1's Trade Offer**:\n   Player 1 has proposed: \n   - Offering: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood \n   - Requesting: 2 Brick\n\n   This trade would reduce your Wheat (down to 7) and Wood (down to 18), while increasing your Brick (up to 14).\n\n3. **Assess the Value**:\n   Your current value breakdown:\n   - Wheat: 6 x 12 = 72\n   - Wood: 9 x 21 = 189\n   - Sheep: 14 x 13 = 182\n   - Brick: 28 x 12 = 336\n   - Ore: 32 x 15 = 480\n  \n   After the trade with Player 1:\n   - Wheat: 6 x 7 = 42\n   - Wood: 9 x 18 = 162\n   - Sheep: 14 x 13 = 182\n   - Brick: 28 x 14 = 392\n   - Ore: 32 x 15 = 480\n  \n   New total value = 42 + 162 + 182 + 392 + 480 = 1258\n   Current total value = 72 + 189 + 182 + 336 + 480 = 1259\n  \n   This trade slightly decreases your total value.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   Since accepting this trade reduces your total value and you're currently in a strong position, it's best to **reject the offer** from Player 1.\n\nHere\u2019s my response:\n\n[Deny]",
