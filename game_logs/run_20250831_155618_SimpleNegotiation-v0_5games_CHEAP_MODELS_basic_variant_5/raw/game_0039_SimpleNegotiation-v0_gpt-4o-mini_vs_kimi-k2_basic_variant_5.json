My Ore is still the highest-value item, so I prefer to avoid giving it away unless I\u2019m clearly profiting. Right now I\u2019m holding 25 Ore (value 40 each), which is more than I need for any single turn. My Brick (21 value) is also plentiful (10 units). I\u2019d like to convert some of these high-value but abundant assets into more scarce resources that give me flexibility later.\n\nTherefore I offer:\n\n[Offer: 3 Ore, 2 Brick -> 5 Sheep, 5 Wheat]",
