      "response": "Given the fixed resource values (Wheat:5, Wood:11, Sheep:18, Brick:25, Ore:36), I aim to increase my total resource value through trades that exploit mismatches in surpluses. My strategy is to offload lower-value excess resources (like Brick and Sheep) to acquire higher-value ones (Ore or Wood), but I must ensure the trade is also incentive-compatible for my opponent to accept.\n\nI start by proposing a win-win trade: I offer two Sheep (total value: 36) for one Wood (value: 11). By my valuation:\n- I gain 18 value (since Wood per-unit value is higher than Sheep's accumulation) and consolidate my stock.\n- Assuming my opponent values the Sheep for its higher per-unit utility (18 vs. Wood's 11), they may accept to rebalance their holdings.\n\n**Offer details**:  \n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Wood]  \n\n*Rationale*:  \n- My Sheep surplus (13 vs. desired 10-12) can be trimmed safely.  \n- Wood\u2019s value (11) is actively targetable to diversify my mid-value portfolio.  \n- This trade values Sheep at ~18.0 per unit and Wood at ~11.0, making it marginally appealing if the opponent underweights Wood.  \n\n*Expected gain*: +7 in value for me (after trade: Sheep reduced by 2, Wood increased by 1 net value shift: 36 - 11 = 25, adjusted for utility).",
