      "response": "Let\u2019s price what is on the table.\n\nOre price schedule (based on what Player 1 has accepted in the past):\n- Turn 6: 3 Sheep + 1 Brick was accepted for 6 Wheat + 4 Wood  \n  3 Sheep = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45  \n  1 Brick  = 29  \n  Total surrendered = 74  \n  Received          = 6 Wheat \u00d7 6 + 4 Wood \u00d7 9 = 36 + 36 = 72  \n  \u21d2 Player 1 was willing to give \u2248 74 worth of goods for 6 Wheat + 4 Wood (not Ore). They clearly value Ore well above 72.\n\nTurn-by-turn summary from its perspective\n- We asked 5 Wheat + 2 Wood (12 + 18 = 30) for 1 Ore and it declined.  \n- It asked 5 Wheat + 1 Wood (30+9=39) for 1 Ore and we declined.  \n- It asked 5 Wheat + 2 Wood (30+18=48) repeatedly and we declined.  \n- It demanded 8 Wheat + 2 Wood (48+18=66) and we declined.  \n\nNow they are back at 6 Wheat + 2 Wood = 36 + 18 = 54.  \nThis is still below what they themselves valued the Sheep/Brick bundle, so they will probably reject again if we counter higher.  \nWe have already declined 54 once.  \nWe might squeeze one more Wheat (7 Wheat + 2 Wood = 60) but the record shows we rejected 8 Wheat + 2 Wood (=66) and 7 Wheat for 1 Ore likewise failed.\n\nTherefore the current offer of 54 is the best they have made on Ore all game.  \nSince time is running short (only 1\u20132 turns left) and the value 54 is close to earlier equilibrium, I\u2019m taking it.\n\n[Accept]",
