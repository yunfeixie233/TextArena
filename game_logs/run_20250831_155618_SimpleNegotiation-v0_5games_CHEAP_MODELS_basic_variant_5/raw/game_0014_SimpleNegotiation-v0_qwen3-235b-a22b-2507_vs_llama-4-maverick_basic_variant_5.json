I can afford to give away some Wheat to gain resources with higher values. \n\nLet's draft a trade offer:\n- **[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 3 Ore]**: This trade involves giving away 8 units of Wheat (Value: 5 each) to gain 3 units of Ore (Value: 32 each). The calculation is as follows:\n  - Resources given away: 8 Wheat = 8 * 5 = 40\n  - Resources gained: 3 Ore = 3 * 32 = 96\n  - Net gain in value: 96 - 40 = 56\n\nThis seems like a beneficial trade.\n\n### Action:\n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 3 Ore]",

      "response": "### Current Resource Reserves:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 10   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 10   Value: 11\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 30   Value: 12\n- [Brick]   Qty: 20   Value: 26\n- [Ore]     Qty: 20   Value: 32\n\n### Analysis of Previous Trades:\n1. **Initial Trade**: Accepted Player 0's offer: Gained 5 Sheep, 3 Brick and lost 6 Wheat, 4 Wood, 2 Ore.\n   - Before: Wheat: 16, Wood: 14, Sheep: 25, Brick: 21, Ore: 22\n   - After:  Wheat: 10, Wood: 10, Sheep: 30, Brick: 24, Ore: 20\n\n2. **Subsequent Offers**: Made several offers to Player 0 but were rejected. The goal was to gain more Ore.\n\n### Evaluation of Current State:\n- The last offer made (8 Wheat -> 3 Ore) was rejected. Trying the same offer again is unlikely to succeed.\n- Current reserves are Wheat: 10, Wood: 10, Sheep: 30, Brick: 20, Ore: 20.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n1. **New Offer**: Since the previous attempts to trade Wheat for Ore were unsuccessful, consider offering a different resource that might be more appealing to Player 0.\n2. **Observation**: Notice that Player 0 initially offered 3 Brick when requesting 6 Wheat, 4 Wood, and 2 Ore. This might indicate a need or desire for Wheat and Wood.\n\n### Proposed Action:\nMake a new offer that involves resources not yet tried in a trade or adjust the quantity/value to be more appealing.\n\n### New Trade Offer:\n- **Offer**: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore] \n  - Reasoning: Since Ore is highly valued and previous attempts to get it were unsuccessful, try offering a combination of Sheep (which is abundant) and Brick (which is moderately valued) to see if Player 0 is willing to make a deal.\n\n### Action:\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
