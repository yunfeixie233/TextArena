Since I have a lot of Ore and it's very valuable, I'm not looking to give it away cheaply. However, I can consider offering some of my less valuable resources or a quantity that doesn't significantly devalue my total stockpile.\n\nOn the first turn, I propose a trade that could potentially benefit me by gaining more valuable resources or strengthening my stockpile. I observe that I have a considerable amount of Wheat, which is one of the less valuable resources.\n\nI will propose: '[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]'\n\nThis trade gives away: (5*6) + (2*12) = 30 + 24 = 54 value\nAnd gains: (2*29) + (1*40) = 58 + 40 = 98 value\n\nThe net gain is 98 - 54 = 44.
