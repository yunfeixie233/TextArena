      "response": "Given the current situation and trades proposed, it's essential to keep track of my resource reserves after the previous accepted trade. Here are my remaining resources after the successful trade with Player 1:\n\nAfter the trade:\n- **Wheat**: 24 - 8 = 16\n- **Wood**: 7 - 3 = 4\n- **Sheep**: 19\n- **Brick**: 24 + 3 = 27\n- **Ore**: 7 - 1 = 6\n\nCurrent reserves:\n- **Wheat**: Qty: 16, Value: 5\n- **Wood**: Qty: 4, Value: 11\n- **Sheep**: Qty: 19, Value: 12\n- **Brick**: Qty: 27, Value: 23\n- **Ore**: Qty: 6, Value: 33\n\nNext, I will evaluate Player 1's offer: \n- They are offering **1 Ore** for **3 Sheep**. \n- The value of 1 Ore is 33, while the value of 3 Sheep is 36 (3 * 12).\n\nThis trade is not favorable to me since I would be giving away resources worth more than I would be receiving. \n\nI will deny this trade proposal.\n\nMy next step will be to make a new trade offer. \n\nI will offer **4 Sheep** in exchange for **2 Brick** and **1 Ore**, as this allows me to reduce my sheep stockpile while gaining high-value resources.\n\nThe action format will be as follows:\n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]",
