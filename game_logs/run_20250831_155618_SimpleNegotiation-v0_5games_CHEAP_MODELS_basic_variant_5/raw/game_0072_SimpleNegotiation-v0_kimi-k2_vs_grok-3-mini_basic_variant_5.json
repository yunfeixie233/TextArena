Ore is worth 37 per unit; Wood is worth only 9.\nGiving up one Ore sacrifices 37 points but I gain 5 Wood for 5\u00d79 = 45 points, a modest +8 net value gain.\n\nThe larger issue: Ore is rarer in the final game state (only 12 left with me) and very high-value. I currently have 12 Ore\u2014insurance against any late-game Ore-sparse board. Trading it away for 9-point Wood risks lowering my leverage for bigger late moves.\n\nTherefore, I\u2019ll reject this offer.\n\n[Deny]",
