This results in a **net value increase of +2**.\n- **Opponent's Perspective**: They give **3 Wood** (36 value) and receive **2 Sheep** (34 value)\u2014a net loss of -2. However, if Player 1 values Sheep for future trades or desires resource diversification, they might overlook the minor deficit. \n- **Risk Management**: This trade uses only a fraction of my Sheep stockpile, ensuring flexibility for future rounds.
