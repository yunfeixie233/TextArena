My Wood and Wheat have the lowest individual values, so I should be willing to trade these if it means acquiring higher-value items or enough quantity to make a profit.\n\nConsidering I have a good quantity of Wood, Sheep, and Brick, I might look to trade some of these for more Wheat to balance my low quantity, or for more Ore if the trade is favorable.\n\nI will start by making an offer that tries to increase my quantity of other resources while potentially profiting on value, or at least breaking even. My Wheat quantity is quite low, and while Wood's individual value is low, I have a good amount of it.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
