      "response": "After analyzing my current resource holdings and the fixed per-unit values, my goal is to maximize my total stockpile value by the end of 10 turns. However, with mutual knowledge of fixed resource values, any trade must be approached strategically, as the opponent will only accept deals they perceive as beneficial to their own total value.\n\nGiven:\n- I have surpluses in Wheat, Wood, and Sheep (19 each), which are lower-value resources (6, 12, 16 per unit).\n- My Brick and Ore are limited (8 and 16) but are high-value (22 and 39 per unit), making them valuable assets to retain.\n- Trades are zero-sum in value terms: I gain only if the opponent loses, and vice versa. This makes mutually beneficial trades impossible under fixed valuations.\n- Without knowing the opponent's resources, I must test their holdings and willingness with initial offers to gather information and build momentum.\n- An opening trade should minimize my risk while probing for weaknesses or opportunities\u2014e.g., offering low-value surpluses at a slight loss to gain trust or information.\n\nFor Turn 1, I propose a conservative offer:\n- **Offer**: 3 Wheat and 2 Wood (my surplus low-value resources) for 1 Ore (high-value).\n  - My value calculation: Give 3*6 + 2*12 = 18 + 24 = 42; Get 1*39 = 39. I lose 3 value.\n  - Opponent's perspective: If they accept, they gain 42 value and lose 39, netting +3. This makes the deal attractive to them if they have ample Ore.\n- If accepted, the loss of 3 value is minor compared to potential future gains (e.g., reinvesting trust or insights from the trade). If denied, it signals Ore scarcity on their side, adjusting my strategy for later turns.\n\nAction for Turn 1:\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
