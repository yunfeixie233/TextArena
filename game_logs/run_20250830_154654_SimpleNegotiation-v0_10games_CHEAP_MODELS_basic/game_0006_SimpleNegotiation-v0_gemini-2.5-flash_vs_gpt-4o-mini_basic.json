      "response": "I will act as Player 0. I need to increase the total value of my resources. I have 10 turns.\n\nMy current resources and their total value:\n*   [Wheat]   Qty: 20   Value: 6   Total Value: 120\n*   [Wood]    Qty: 10   Value: 12  Total Value: 120\n*   [Sheep]   Qty: 6    Value: 12  Total Value: 72\n*   [Brick]   Qty: 8    Value: 22  Total Value: 176\n*   [Ore]     Qty: 19   Value: 33  Total Value: 627\n**Current Total Value: 1115**\n\nI want to make an offer that increases my total value. To do this, I should aim to trade resources I have in abundance or those with lower individual value for resources that are more valuable or that I need.\n\nLet's analyze my resources and their values to prepare for an offer:\n*   Wheat: 6 (low value, high quantity)\n*   Wood: 12 (medium value, medium quantity)\n*   Sheep: 12 (medium value, low quantity)\n*   Brick: 22 (high value, medium quantity)\n*   Ore: 33 (very high value, high quantity)\n\nI have a lot of Wheat and Ore. Brick and Ore have the highest individual values.\n\nLet's try to trade Wheat for something more valuable. Or perhaps trade a small amount of Ore/Brick (high value) for a larger quantity of medium value resources to increase overall quantity and potentially total value.\n\nMy first offer should be reasonably attractive to Player 1, but also beneficial to me. I'll propose giving up some Wheat and potentially some Wood/Sheep for Brick or Ore, or other resources that are more valuable than Wheat/Wood.\n\nLet's try to get more high-value resources like Brick or Ore.\n\n**Turn 1 Strategy:**\nI will offer a combination of lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for higher-value ones (Brick, Ore).\nAlternatively, I could offer some of my abundant high-value Ore for other high value resources if I believe Player 1 might have a need for it and offer a good ratio.\n\nLet's try to trade 3 Wheat (value 18) and 1 Wood (value 12) for 1 Brick (value 22) and 1 Sheep (value 12).\nMy offer: 3 Wheat + 1 Wood Value = 18 + 12 = 30\nRequested: 1 Brick + 1 Sheep Value = 22 + 12 = 34\nThis increases my total value by 4.\n\nI think I can do better. Let's try to get Ore.\nHow about offering 5 Wheat (30) and 2 Wood (24) for 2 Ore (66)?\nMy offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood (Total Value 54)\nRequested: 2 Ore (Total Value 66)\nThis increases my total value by 12. This seems like a reasonable offer for me.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
