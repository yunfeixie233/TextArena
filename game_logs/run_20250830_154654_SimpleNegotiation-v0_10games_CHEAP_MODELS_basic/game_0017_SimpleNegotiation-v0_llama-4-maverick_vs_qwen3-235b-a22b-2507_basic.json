      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, I will analyze my current resources and their values to determine the best course of action for the first turn.\n\n**Current Resources and Values:**\n\n1. Wheat - Qty: 12, Value: 5\n2. Wood - Qty: 24, Value: 11\n3. Sheep - Qty: 19, Value: 17\n4. Brick - Qty: 20, Value: 26\n5. Ore - Qty: 8, Value: 37\n\n**Total Value:** To understand my current standing, I'll calculate the total value of my resources.\n\n- Total Value = (12 * 5) + (24 * 11) + (19 * 17) + (20 * 26) + (8 * 37)\n- Total Value = 60 + 264 + 323 + 520 + 296\n- Total Value = 1463\n\n### Negotiation Strategy\n\nTo increase my total value, I need to negotiate trades that give me resources with higher values in exchange for those with lower values. Given the current values:\n\n- The highest value resources I have are Ore (Value: 37) and Brick (Value: 26).\n- The lowest value resources I have are Wheat (Value: 5) and Wood (Value: 11).\n\n### First Turn Action\n\nI'll start by making an offer that trades some of my lower-value resources for resources that are either of the same type (to ensure the trade is beneficial due to quantity) or of higher value. However, without knowing the opponent's resources, I'll aim for a general strategy.\n\nLet's consider trading some Wheat (the lowest value resource) for another resource. Since Sheep and Brick are relatively valuable, I'll think about how to get more of those or maintain my current high-value resources.\n\n**Offer:** I'll start by offering some Wheat for Sheep, as Sheep is more valuable than Wheat and Wood.\n\n`[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]`\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 6 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 2 Sheep, 0 Brick, 0 Ore]`\n\nUsing the special token format, it is: `[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]`\n\nLet's make the offer: `[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]`\n\nI'll wait for the opponent's response to proceed with either `[Accept]` or `[Deny]` based on their counteroffer or negotiation. \n\nSince I need to directly provide the action in the required format, here's the action for the first turn:\n\n`[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]`",

I have a lot of Brick (Value: 26) and relatively less Ore (Value: 37), which is more valuable per unit. \n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some Brick for Ore. Let's analyze:\n- Offering 5 Brick (Value: 26 * 5 = 130) for 2 Ore (Value: 37 * 2 = 74) doesn't seem beneficial as I'm giving up more value than I'm getting.\n- However, if I offer something less valuable for Ore, it could be beneficial.\n\nLet's directly inspect my resources and values again and consider an alternative trade.\n\nI will make a new offer: \n[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (4 * 11) + (2 * 5) = 44 + 10 = 54 and requests 1 Ore worth 37. This isn't a great trade for me as I'm giving up more than I'm getting. Let's adjust.\n\nConsidering my initial resources and the rejection, another potential offer could be:\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]\n\nThis is somewhat similar to my initial offer but without using the 6 Wheat I previously offered. Let's see:\n- I'm offering 5 Wheat (Value: 5 * 5 = 25) for 2 Sheep (Value: 2 * 17 = 34), which is a gain.\n\nSo, my next action will be: \n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]",

This trade is not in our favor.\n\n## Step 8: Reconsider the trade offer based on value\nSince offering 3 Brick for 1 Ore is not favorable, let's think about other resources.\n- What if we offer something less valuable for Ore? For example, Wood or Sheep for Ore.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate offering Sheep or Wood for Ore\n- Offering Sheep for Ore: 2 Sheep (2*17 = 34) for 1 Ore (1*37 = 37) is slightly favorable.\n- Let's propose: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\n## Step 10: Decide on the action for this turn\nGiven the analysis, making a new offer seems like the best course of action.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]}$",

      "response": "## Step 1: Evaluate the current resources and their values.\nThe current resources and their values are: Wheat (12, 5), Wood (24, 11), Sheep (19, 17), Brick (20, 26), Ore (8, 37).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total current value of the resources.\nTotal value = (12 * 5) + (24 * 11) + (19 * 17) + (20 * 26) + (8 * 37) = 60 + 264 + 323 + 520 + 296 = 1463.\n\n## Step 3: Review the previous trade offers and their outcomes to understand the negotiation history.\n- Offered 6 Wheat for 2 Sheep, rejected.\n- Offered 4 Wood, 2 Wheat for 1 Ore, rejected.\n- Offered 5 Brick, 3 Wheat for 2 Ore, rejected.\n- Received an offer for 3 Sheep, 1 Wood in exchange for 5 Brick, 1 Wheat, rejected.\n- Offered 4 Brick for 1 Ore, rejected.\n- Received an offer for 3 Sheep, 2 Wood in exchange for 4 Brick, 1 Wheat, rejected.\n- Offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore, rejected.\n- Received an offer for 10 Wheat, 1 Wood in exchange for 3 Ore.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the last received offer from Player 1.\nPlayer 1 is offering 10 Wheat and 1 Wood in exchange for 3 Ore. The current quantity and value of the resources involved are: Wheat (12, 5), Wood (24, 11), Ore (8, 37).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the value of the resources involved in the last offer.\n- Giving up 3 Ore = 3 * 37 = 111.\n- Receiving 10 Wheat = 10 * 5 = 50.\n- Receiving 1 Wood = 1 * 11 = 11.\nTotal value received = 50 + 11 = 61.\nNet change = 61 - 111 = -50.\n\n## Step 6: Decide whether to accept or reject the last offer based on the calculated value change.\nSince the net change is negative (-50), accepting the offer would decrease the total value of resources.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a response to the last offer.\nGiven that accepting the offer results in a negative net change, the offer should be rejected.\n\n## Step 8: Consider making a new offer.\nLet's examine the resources again and think about a potential trade that could increase the total value. We need to identify what we can offer that is of less value to us than what we are requesting.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate potential new offers.\nOne potential trade could involve offering resources that are abundant or of lower value for resources that are scarce or of higher value.\n\n## Step 10: Formulate a new offer based on the current resources and their values.\nConsider offering some Wheat (low value) or Wood (relatively low value) for Ore (high value), or other similar combinations.\n\n## Step 11: Propose a new trade offer.\nLet's offer 5 Wheat for 1 Ore. The value given is 5 * 5 = 25, and the value received is 1 * 37 = 37. Net gain = 37 - 25 = 12.\n\n## Step 12: Format the new offer according to the game's special tokens.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]}$",
