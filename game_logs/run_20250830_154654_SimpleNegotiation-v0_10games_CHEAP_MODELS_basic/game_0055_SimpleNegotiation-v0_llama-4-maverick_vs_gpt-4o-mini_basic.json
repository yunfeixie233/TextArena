      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, let's start by analyzing the current state of our resources:\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 13, Value: 5\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 11, Value: 12\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 9, Value: 15\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 13, Value: 22\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 17, Value: 36\n\n### Initial Strategy\n\nOur goal is to increase the total value of our resources through trades. To maximize the total value, we should aim to acquire resources with higher values and potentially dispose of or trade away resources with lower values if it's beneficial.\n\n### Current Total Value\n\nLet's calculate the current total value of our resources:\n\n1. Wheat: 13 * 5 = 65\n2. Wood: 11 * 12 = 132\n3. Sheep: 9 * 15 = 135\n4. Brick: 13 * 22 = 286\n5. Ore: 17 * 36 = 612\n\nTotal Value = 65 + 132 + 135 + 286 + 612 = 1230\n\n### Potential Trades\n\nTo increase the total value, we should look for opportunities to trade resources with lower values for those with higher values. Given the current distribution:\n\n- The highest value resource we have is Ore (Value: 36).\n- The lowest value resource we have is Wheat (Value: 5).\n\nA potential strategy is to trade away some of our lower-value resources for higher-value ones or to consolidate resources that are likely to be valued by the other player.\n\n### First Move\n\nFor the first move, let's make an offer that could potentially increase our total value or at least is a reasonable trade. Noting that we have a good amount of Ore, which is our most valuable resource, we might want to be cautious about trading it away. However, making a trade that involves Ore could be beneficial if we get a good deal.\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (our least valuable resource) for a resource that could potentially be more valuable or useful to us. However, without knowing the opponent's resources, we'll have to make an educated guess.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nWe have more Brick than Sheep, and both are relatively valuable. Let's propose a trade that involves our least valuable resource (Wheat) for one of the more valuable resources we don't have in excess relative to others.\n\nLet's offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis is a risky move as Ore is our most valuable resource, but we're starting with a relatively small quantity of Wheat. Let's see how the opponent responds.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's response.",

Player 0's offer to Player 1: 2 Ore for 1 Brick was rejected. So, no change.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Wheat: 9\n- Wood: 11\n- Sheep: 10\n- Brick: 8\n- Ore: 22\n\n### Values of Current Resources\n\nLet's calculate the total value:\n- Wheat: 9 * 5 = 45\n- Wood: 11 * 12 = 132\n- Sheep: 10 * 15 = 150\n- Brick: 8 * 22 = 176\n- Ore: 22 * 36 = 792\n\nTotal value = 45 + 132 + 150 + 176 + 792 = 1295\n\n### Next Action\n\nTo decide the next action, we should analyze the current state and the potential trades. We need to identify resources that are valuable and those that are less valuable compared to others.\n\nGiven the current values and quantities:\n- Ore is very valuable, and we have a significant amount (22 units).\n- Brick, Sheep, and Wood are moderately valuable, and we have a decent amount of each.\n- Wheat is the least valuable resource among the ones we have, and we have 9 units left.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some of the less valuable resources or those that are not as abundant in value, in exchange for more valuable resources or increasing the quantity of already valuable resources.\n\nLet's examine possible trades:\n1. We could offer some Wheat (less valuable) for another resource.\n2. We could also consider trading some of our moderately valuable resources if we can get a good deal.\n\nConsidering the last offer made by Player 0 was rejected, and looking at our resources, a possible next step is to make an offer that could be attractive to Player 1.\n\n### New Offer\n\nLet's propose a trade that involves giving away some Wheat (since it's less valuable and we still have 9 units) for something more valuable.\n\n```plaintext\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n```\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThe reasoning is to gain more Ore since it's highly valuable. \n\nResponse: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`",
