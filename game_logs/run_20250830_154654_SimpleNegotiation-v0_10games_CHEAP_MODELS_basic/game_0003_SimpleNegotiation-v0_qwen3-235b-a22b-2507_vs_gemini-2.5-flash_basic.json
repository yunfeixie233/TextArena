Total: 128\n    - Requested: 5 Sheep (5 * 18 = 90), 3 Ore (3 * 38 = 114). Total: 204\nThe offer is not beneficial to Player 1 as the requested resources have a higher value than the offered resources.\n\nPlayer 1's previous offer: Offered items: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> Requested items: 2 Ore.\nValue of Player 1's offer:\n    - Offered: 3 Wood (3 * 8 = 24), 2 Wheat (2 * 6 = 12). Total: 36\n    - Requested: 2 Ore (2 * 38 = 76).\nThis offer is beneficial to Player 1.\n\n\nConsidering Player 0 rejected the previous offer, I should try to make an offer that is still beneficial to me, but perhaps slightly more appealing to Player 0. I want to acquire more high-value resources like Ore or Sheep, and can potentially offer some Wood, Wheat, or even Brick if the exchange is favorable.\n\nLet's offer a slightly higher value of my own resources for a similar or slightly lower value of Player 0's high-value resources.\n\nMy current high values are Ore (38) and Brick (22). My low values are Wheat (6) and Wood (8). Sheep (18) is mid-range.\n\nI want to increase my total value.\nI have a lot of Ore (20), but it's valuable. I also have a lot of Brick (14).\nI have less Sheep (7) and Wheat (9) and Wood (11).\n\nLet's try to get more Sheep.\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Sheep]\nValue of Offer:\n- Offered: 5 Wood (5 * 8 = 40)\n- Requested: 2 Sheep (2 * 18 = 36)\nThis is slightly in my favor, though Player 0 might not accept it as it's a loss for them.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore.\n[Offer: 6 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue of Offer:\n- Offered: 6 Wood (6 * 8 = 48)\n- Requested: 1 Ore (1 * 38 = 38)\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nLet's try to get more Sheep by offering Brick.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 3 Sheep]\nValue of offer:\n- Offered: 2 Brick (2 * 22 = 44)\n- Requested: 3 Sheep (3 * 18 = 54)\nThis is good for me. Player 0 might accept this if they need Brick.\n\nLet's try offering a mix of low-value items.\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore]\nValue of offer:\n- Offered: 4 Wheat (4 * 6 = 24) + 3 Wood (3 * 8 = 24) = 48\n- Requested: 2 Ore (2 * 38 = 76)\nThis is very good for me.\n\nLet's try a less aggressive offer to increase chances of acceptance, but still beneficial to me. I need to get rid of some low-value resources for high-value ones.\nI have a lot of Brick and Ore, but they are valuable. I have a fair amount of Wood.\n\nPlayer 0 rejected my previous offer of (3 Wood, 2 Wheat) for (2 Ore). Value-wise: (36) for (76). It was a 40 value gain for me.\n\nPerhaps offering more of a similar value resource that I have many of, like Brick, for a more valuable one like Ore.\nResources of Player 0 are unknown.\n\nLet's try to acquire more Sheep, as it's a mid-range value and I have fewer of them.\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]\nValue for me:\n- Offered: 4 Wood (4 * 8 = 32), 2 Wheat (2 * 6 = 12). Total = 44\n- Requested: 2 Sheep (2 * 18 = 36).\nThis is a small loss for me, so I won't propose it. I need to make sure the \"requested resources\" value is higher than \"offered resources\" value for *me*.\n\nLet's re-evaluate my last offer that was rejected: Offered items: 3 Wood (24), 2 Wheat (12) -> Requested items: 2 Ore (76). My gain was 40. This was a very greedy offer for me.\n\nI should make the offer more balanced for Player 0 as well to increase the likelihood of success.\nI still want to get Ore or Sheep because they have higher values.\nLet's try to get 1 Ore for some Wood and Wheat.\nI have 11 Wood and 9 Wheat.\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue of offer for me:\n- Offered: 4 Wood (4 * 8 = 32), 3 Wheat (3 * 6 = 18). Total = 50\n- Requested: 1 Ore (1 * 38 = 38).\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nOkay, let's look at the values again.\nWheat (6), Wood (8), Sheep (18), Brick (22), Ore (38).\n\nI want to acquire higher value resources by offering lower value resources.\nLet's offer some Wood and Wheat for Sheep.\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]\nOffered Value: 3*8 + 2*6 = 24 + 12 = 36\nRequested Value: 2*18 = 36\nThis offer is neutral for me, which means it will be neutral for Player 0 if they don't value these resources differently. I need to make a gain.\n\nLet's try this:\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]\nOffered Value: 3*8 + 3*6 = 24 + 18 = 42\nRequested Value: 2*18 = 36\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nI need to offer less value than I receive.\nLet's try to get 1 Ore (38 value).\nHow about 2 Brick (44 value)? No, that's a loss.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (22) and get 2 Wheat (12) + 1 Wood (8)? No that's a loss.\nI have a lot of Brick.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 2 Ore]\nOffered Value: 2 * 22 = 44\nRequested Value: 2 * 38 = 76\nThis is a gain of 32 for me. It's a good offer for me. Player 0 might accept it if they need Brick.\n\nLet's try to get value from my abundant resources.\nI have 20 Ore. Maybe I can trade some for Sheep for diversification if the rate is good.\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Sheep]\nOffered Value: 1 * 38 = 38\nRequested Value: 2 * 18 = 36\nThis is a slight loss for me.\n\nOkay, I need to stick to the strategy of trading low value for high value, or trading high quantity for higher value if the ratio is good.\nI have 14 Brick. I can trade some of them.\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue Offered: (3 * 8) + (4 * 6) = 24 + 24 = 48\nValue Requested: 1 * 38 = 38\nThis is a loss for me. Player 0 wouldn't even consider my previous very beneficial offer.\n\nLet's try to offer a relatively high value of my low-value resources, for a higher value of a resource I want.\n[Offer: 7 Wood -> 3 Sheep]\nValue Offered: 7 * 8 = 56\nValue Requested: 3 * 18 = 54\nThis is a loss of 2 for me.\n\nThe last offer I made was a gain of 40 for me. This was too aggressive.\nLet's aim for a gain of 10-20.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\nOffered Value: (5 * 8) + (3 * 6) = 40 + 18 = 58\nRequested Value: 2 * 38 = 76\nThis is a gain of 18 for me (76 - 58 = 18). This seems reasonable for Player 0 as well. It's not as aggressive as my last offer regarding quantity.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",
