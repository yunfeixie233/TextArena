      "response": "All right, it's my turn again. Player 1 rejected my previous offer and didn't make one of their own, so I need to come up with a new strategy. My goal is to increase the total value of my resources.\n\nLet's re-evaluate my current resources and their values:\n*   **Wheat:** Qty: 17, Value: 6 (Total Value: 102)\n*   **Wood:** Qty: 25, Value: 11 (Total Value: 275)\n*   **Sheep:** Qty: 9, Value: 13 (Total Value: 117)\n*   **Brick:** Qty: 21, Value: 28 (Total Value: 588)\n*   **Ore:** Qty: 11, Value: 35 (Total Value: 385)\n\nMy goal is to acquire more high-value items like Ore and Brick, possibly by trading away some of my abundant lower-value items, or a bit of everything if I can get a good deal.\n\nMy last offer was 5 Wheat, 5 Wood for 2 Ore, 1 Brick.\nValue of offered items: (5 * 6) + (5 * 11) = 30 + 55 = 85\nValue of requested items: (2 * 35) + (1 * 28) = 70 + 28 = 98\nThis was a good deal for me, as the requested items were worth more than the offered. Player 1 might have rejected it because they didn't have the requested items or they felt it wasn't beneficial enough for them.\n\nSince Player 1 didn't counter, I should try to make an offer that is still beneficial for me but perhaps more appealing to Player 1. I have a lot of Wood and Wheat. I also have a good amount of Brick, but it's high value, so I might want to hold onto it unless I get something even better.\n\nLet's try to trade some Wood and Sheep for Ore. Ore is my highest value item.\n\nNew offer idea: Trade some Wood and Sheep for Ore.\nHow about: 8 Wood (Value 8 * 11 = 88) + 2 Sheep (Value 2 * 13 = 26) = Total 114\nFor: 3 Ore (Value 3 * 35 = 105)\n\nThis offer is slightly more balanced value-wise, and still gives me a net gain in value (getting 105 worth of Ore for 114 worth of lower-value items, so it's selling high volume, lower value for lower volume, higher value). It reduces my quantity of high-abundance items (Wood).\n\n[Offer: 8 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Ore]",

What should I offer next?  \n   My Brick and Ore are both very high-value; I\u2019d prefer **more** of them, not less.  \n   Wheat and Wood are low-value to me, so those are the natural candidates to **offer away**.  \n   I am short of Sheep (only 6) and its value is middling, so I won\u2019t try to dump it.\n\n4. Propose a trade that benefits me on value while still looking \u201creasonable\u201d to the human opponent.  \n   I will give 5 Wheat for 1 Brick.  \n   Value to me: lose 5\u00d76 = 30, gain 1\u00d729 = 29 \u2192 virtually a wash, but since I am drowning in Wheat (18!) this is effectively an upgrade.  \n   From the opponent\u2019s perspective, a 5-to-1 Wheat-for-Brick ratio isn\u2019t terrible because Brick is highly valued anyway, so I hope they consider it.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
