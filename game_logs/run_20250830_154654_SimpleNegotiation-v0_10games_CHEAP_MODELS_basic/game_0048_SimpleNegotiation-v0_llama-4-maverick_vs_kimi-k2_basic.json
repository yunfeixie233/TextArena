      "response": "### Initial Analysis\n\nTo maximize the total value of my resources, I need to analyze the current resources and their values.\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 8 units, Value: 6\n   - Wood: 25 units, Value: 11\n   - Sheep: 14 units, Value: 17\n   - Brick: 24 units, Value: 26\n   - Ore: 25 units, Value: 33\n\n2. **Total Current Value:**\n   - Total Value = (8*6) + (25*11) + (14*17) + (24*26) + (25*33)\n   - Total Value = 48 + 275 + 238 + 624 + 825 = 2010\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - My goal is to increase the total value by trading resources.\n   - To do this, I need to identify which resources are undervalued or overvalued relative to others and make trades accordingly.\n\n### First Turn Analysis\n\n1. **Relative Values per Unit:**\n   - Wheat: 6\n   - Wood: 11\n   - Sheep: 17\n   - Brick: 26\n   - Ore: 33\n\n2. **Initial Observation:**\n   - Resources like Wheat and Wood have lower values compared to Sheep, Brick, and Ore.\n   - It might be beneficial to trade away some Wheat and Wood for other resources if it increases overall value.\n\n### Trade Offer for Turn 1\n\nLet's analyze potential trades. Since Ore has the highest value per unit (33), and I already have a significant amount of it, I should be cautious not to lose too much Ore. However, having a lot of Ore also means I can potentially trade some of it for other valuable resources if it makes sense.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of my less valuable resources or an abundance of a resource for something that could potentially increase in value or is scarce.\n\n### My Offer for Turn 1\nGiven my resources, a reasonable first offer might involve trading some Wheat (the lowest value resource) and possibly some Wood for a resource that could be valuable. However, without knowing the opponent's resources, I'll start by proposing a trade that seems generally reasonable.\n\nLet's propose: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 4 Sheep, 2 Ore]`\n\nThis trade involves:\n- Offering 5 Wheat (Value: 5*6 = 30) and 5 Wood (Value: 5*11 = 55), totaling a value of 85.\n- Requesting 4 Sheep (Value: 4*17 = 68) and 2 Ore (Value: 2*33 = 66), totaling a value of 134.\n\nThe proposed trade increases my total value by 49 (134 - 85 = 49), assuming the opponent accepts.\n\nMy action for Turn 1: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 5 Wood -> 4 Sheep, 2 Ore]`",

We need to think about what Player 1 might be interested in and what we can gain.\n\nGiven that Player 1 accepted trades that gave them Wheat and Brick and Ore in return for Wood and Sheep, we can infer they might be looking for certain resources. However, our last two offers were rejected, indicating we need to rethink our strategy.\n\nLet's examine our resources and their values:\n- We are rich in Sheep, Brick, and Ore, and relatively low on Wheat.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some of our less valuable resources (in terms of quantity or type) for something more valuable or needed. However, given our current holdings, we should also consider what we can afford to lose and what we need more of.\n\nOne possible trade is to offer some Brick (since we have a lot and it's valuable) or Sheep for more Ore (since it's the most valuable). Let's think about a reasonable trade.\n\nWe have:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 3    Value: 6\n- [Wood]    Qty: 18   Value: 11\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 17   Value: 17\n- [Brick]   Qty: 22   Value: 26\n- [Ore]     Qty: 28   Value: 33\n\nLet's propose a trade:\n- Offer: 2 Sheep -> Request: 1 Ore\n\nThe value given is 2 * 17 = 34, and the value received is 1 * 33 = 33. This isn't beneficial.\n\nLet's think about another trade:\n- Offer: 3 Brick -> Request: 2 Ore (since Brick is valuable and we have it)\n\nThe value given is 3 * 26 = 78, and the value received is 2 * 33 = 66. This isn't beneficial either.\n\nLet's consider using Wood or Wheat:\n- Offer: 2 Wood -> Request: 1 Ore\n\nThe value given is 2 * 11 = 22, and the value received is 1 * 33 = 33. This is a beneficial trade.\n\nThus, the next offer could be:\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nLet's send this offer.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
