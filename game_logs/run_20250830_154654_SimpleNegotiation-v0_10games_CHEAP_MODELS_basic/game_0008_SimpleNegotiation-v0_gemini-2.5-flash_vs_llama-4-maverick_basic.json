Sheep is 12. Wheat is 6. Wood is 11. Brick is 28.\n\nOffer 1: Try to trade Sheep for Ore at a slightly better ratio for me than last time.\nLast time it was 2 Sheep for 1 Ore (24 vs 39).\nLet's try 3 Sheep for 1 Ore (36 vs 39). This is a marginal gain for me but still positive.\n\nOffer 2: Try to trade Wheat for Ore.\nGiven the large quantity of Wheat, I can afford to offer a significant amount for Ore.\nHow about 5 Wheat for 1 Ore? (30 vs 39). This is also a gain for me.\nOr 6 Wheat for 1 Ore? (36 vs 39). Still a small gain.\n\nOffer 3: Trade Sheep for Brick.\nBrick value is 28.\nHow about 2 Sheep for 1 Brick? (24 vs 28). This is a good gain for me.\n\nOffer 4: Trade Wood for Ore.\n1 Wood is 11. 1 Ore is 39. Needs more Wood.\n3 Wood for 1 Ore? (33 vs 39). Also a good value increase.\n\nI will start with an offer that seems mutually beneficial based on the previous trade and my resource values.\nPlayer 1 accepted 2 Sheep for 1 Ore. So they might value Sheep highly or Ore lower.\n\nLet's try to get some Brick, as it's a good intermediate value resource to accumulate.\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nValue of 2 Sheep = 24. Value of 1 Brick = 28.\nThis is a gain of 4 for me.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to push for Ore:\nLet's try again with Sheep for Ore, but slightly less aggressive to make it more appealing to P1.\nInstead of 3 Sheep for 1 Ore, let's stick with a ratio close to the accepted one.\nThe previous trade was 2 Sheep for 1 Ore.\nMaybe 5 Sheep for 2 Ore? (60 vs 78). This is a gain of 18 for me. And it gives P1 5 Sheep (worth 60).\n\nPlayer 1 accepted my previous offer, so they might be amenable to more trades.\nI will propose:\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "### Current Resources and Values\n\nAfter the previous trades, the current state of my resources and their values is as follows:\n\n1. **Wheat**: Initially 17, no change so far.\n   - Qty: 17, Value: 6 per unit\n2. **Wood**: Initially 11, no change so far.\n   - Qty: 11, Value: 9 per unit\n3. **Sheep**: Initially 6, +2 (from the first trade) +2 (from the second trade) = 10\n   - Qty: 10, Value: 13 per unit\n4. **Brick**: Initially 21, +5 (from the second trade) = 26, -1 (from the first trade) = 25 (correction: the first trade didn't involve Brick directly, so it's actually just +5 from the second trade, and no change from the first, so Qty: 21 + 5 = 26)\n   - Qty: 26, Value: 29 per unit\n5. **Ore**: Initially 14, -1 (from the first trade) -1 (from the third trade) -1 (from the fourth trade) = 11\n   - Qty: 11, Value: 37 per unit\n\nLet's correct and simplify the above:\n- Wheat: 17 + 2*3 = 17 + 6 = 23 (since 2 Wheat were given in the last three trades)\n- Wood: 11 - 1*3 = 11 - 3 = 8 (since 1 Wood was given in the last three trades)\n- Sheep: 6 + 2 + 2 = 10\n- Brick: 21 + 5 = 26 (from the second trade)\n- Ore: 14 - 1 -1 -1 = 11\n\nCorrected Resources:\n- Wheat: 23\n- Wood: 8\n- Sheep: 10\n- Brick: 26\n- Ore: 11\n\n### Calculation of Current Total Value\n\n1. Wheat: 23 * 6 = 138\n2. Wood: 8 * 9 = 72\n3. Sheep: 10 * 13 = 130\n4. Brick: 26 * 29 = 754\n5. Ore: 11 * 37 = 407\n\nTotal Value = 138 + 72 + 130 + 754 + 407 = 1501\n\n### Game Situation and Strategy\n\nThe game is at Turn 6 out of 10. I have accepted several trades from Player 0, which have altered my resource quantities. To maximize my total value, I need to analyze my current resources and the potential trades.\n\n### Potential Trades\n\nTo increase my total value, I should look for opportunities to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or maintain a balance that could lead to a more favorable trade later.\n\n1. **Giving away lower-value resources for higher-value ones**: If possible, I should offer resources like Wheat (Value: 6) or Wood (Value: 9) for resources with higher values.\n\n2. **Current Opportunities**: Since Player 0 has made a repetitive offer similar to the previous turns, I should analyze if accepting it again is beneficial or if I should propose a different trade.\n\n### Next Move\n\nLet's examine a potential trade:\n- I have a significant amount of Wheat and could potentially offer some Wheat for a higher-value resource. However, Player 0 has been consistently offering Ore in exchange for Wheat and Wood. \n\nGiven that I already have a considerable amount of Ore and Brick, and my Ore is valued highly, I should think about maintaining or increasing my high-value resources.\n\nLet's make a trade offer: \n- I can offer some Wheat and/or Wood (lower value) for Brick or Ore (higher value). \n\nOne possible trade could be: `[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]`\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]` is a potential offer to make, as it involves trading lower-value resources for a higher-value one (Ore).\n\nLet's propose: `[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\n### Response\n\nLet's wait for Player 0's response to my offer. \n\nSince my last action was to propose a trade, I will follow the required format and directly provide the action.\n\n`[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]`",
