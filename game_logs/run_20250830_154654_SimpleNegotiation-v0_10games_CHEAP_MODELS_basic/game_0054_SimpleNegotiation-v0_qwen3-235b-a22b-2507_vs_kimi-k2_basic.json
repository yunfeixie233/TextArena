Your offer was already very favorable to you (you gained 51 value) \u2014 but Player 0 still rejected it. This implies they either:\n  - Value Brick much higher than you do (unlikely, since you already value each Brick at 9);\n  - Don\u2019t need your offered resources;\n  - Or simply didn\u2019t find the exchange worthwhile for them.\n\nNext steps:\nYou still have high-value Brick (14 left) and Ore (6 left, very valuable to you). Your Wood and Wheat are lower-value.\n\nLet\u2019s try a more balanced trade. Player 0 may want something they\u2019re short on \u2014 perhaps Ore, which you have at 35 value each. Or they may want more Sheep/Wood, which you have plenty of.\n\nTry a new approach: offer some Ore and Wood for their Brick (but ask for fewer Brick since you already have 14). Ore is your highest-value resource, so giving up 1 or 2 is risky, but Brick is scarce and valuable to you. A smaller trade to test their interest.\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore, 4 Wood -> 2 Brick]",
