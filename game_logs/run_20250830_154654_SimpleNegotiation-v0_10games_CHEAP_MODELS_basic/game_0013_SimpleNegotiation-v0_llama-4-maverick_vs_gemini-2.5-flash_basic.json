      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first calculate the total value of the resources I currently have.\n\nI have:\n- 18 Wheat, valued at 5 each, totals to 18 * 5 = 90\n- 12 Wood, valued at 10 each, totals to 12 * 10 = 120\n- 8 Sheep, valued at 12 each, totals to 8 * 12 = 96\n- 11 Brick, valued at 22 each, totals to 11 * 22 = 242\n- 25 Ore, valued at 37 each, totals to 25 * 37 = 925\n\nTotal value = 90 + 120 + 96 + 242 + 925 = 1473\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given the current values, Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n1. I have a lot of Wheat and Ore. Trading Wheat for other resources could be beneficial if I get something of higher total value.\n2. Ore is very valuable. Losing some Ore could be okay if I gain resources that increase or at least maintain my total value.\n\nSince I'm Player 0, I'll start by making an offer. A reasonable initial offer could involve trading some Wheat (the least valuable resource per unit) for something more valuable.\n\nLet's offer 5 Wheat (total value = 25) for 1 Brick (value = 22), which doesn't seem like a good trade. Let's think about trading Wheat for Sheep or Wood.\n\nTrading 5 Wheat (value = 25) for 2 Wood (value = 20) is not beneficial. How about trading for Sheep?\n\nLet's consider: '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'.\n\nValue given: 5 Wheat = 5 * 5 = 25  \nValue received: 1 Sheep = 12\n\nThis isn't a good trade. Let's think about another option.\n\nConsidering Ore is very valuable and I have a lot, maybe trading some Ore for other resources could work.\n\nLet's think: '[Offer: 2 Ore -> 1 Brick]'.\n\nValue given: 2 Ore = 2 * 37 = 74  \nValue received: 1 Brick = 22\n\nThis is not a good trade. \n\nLet's examine another possibility: '[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep]'.\n\nValue given: 3 Wheat + 1 Wood = (3*5) + (1*10) = 15 + 10 = 25  \nValue received: 2 Sheep = 2 * 12 = 24\n\nStill not beneficial.\n\nLet's directly consider a more significant trade involving Wheat and Ore for Brick or Sheep.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep]' could be an interesting trade.\n\nValue given: 4 Wheat + 1 Ore = (4*5) + 37 = 20 + 37 = 57  \nValue received: 3 Sheep = 3 * 12 = 36\n\nThis is still not it.\n\nLet's simplify: '[Offer: 2 Ore -> 5 Brick]'.\n\nValue given: 2 Ore = 2 * 37 = 74  \nValue received: 5 Brick = 5 * 22 = 110\n\nThis is a positive trade.\n\nMy action: '[Offer: 2 Ore -> 5 Brick]'",

We have been trying to acquire Sheep, which is a relatively valuable resource, but our offers have been rejected. The last offer we received was for 4 Wood in exchange for 1 Sheep, which we rejected. \n\nLet's analyze:\n- We have 12 Wood, and the opponent wants 4 Wood for 1 Sheep. This means we would be left with 8 Wood, and we would gain 1 Sheep.\n- The value change would be: Losing 4 Wood (4 * 10 = 40) and gaining 1 Sheep (1 * 12 = 12). This is not beneficial as it results in a net loss of value (40 - 12 = 28).\n\nHowever, we need to think about our next move:\n1. We could continue trying to get a better deal for Sheep or other resources.\n2. We could accept the last offer made by Player1 if it seems reasonable upon reevaluation or make a counteroffer that is more balanced.\n\nGiven that our attempts to get Sheep have failed so far, let's try a different resource. We have a lot of Ore, which is the most valuable resource. Let's try to make an offer that involves Ore.\n\nLet's make a new offer: \n[Offer:2 Ore -> 1 Sheep]\n\nThis offer reduces our Ore quantity by 2 but attempts to gain 1 Sheep. The value change would be: Losing 2 Ore (2 * 37 = 74) and gaining 1 Sheep (1 * 12 = 12). This is still not beneficial.\n\nLet's think about a more balanced offer. If we consider our previous rejections and the value, let's directly propose a trade that might be more appealing, focusing on resources we have in abundance relative to their value.\n\nLet's try: \n[Offer:4 Ore -> 2 Sheep]\n\nThe value change here would be: Losing 4 Ore (4 * 37 = 148) and gaining 2 Sheep (2 * 12 = 24).

      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the current game state and task.\nThe task is to increase the total value of resources by trading with Player 1. The current resources are: Wheat (18, Value: 5), Wood (12, Value: 10), Sheep (8, Value: 12), Brick (11, Value: 22), Ore (25, Value: 37).\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the current resources and their total value.\nCalculate the initial total value: (18*5) + (12*10) + (8*12) + (11*22) + (25*37) = 90 + 120 + 96 + 242 + 925 = 1473.\n\n## Step 3: Assess previous trade offers and their outcomes.\nPrevious offers were made and rejected. Notably, offering Wheat or Wood for Sheep was rejected. Offering Ore and Brick for Sheep was also not successful. Player 1 offered 1 Sheep for 3 Ore, which is a potential trade.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the last offer made by Player 1.\nPlayer 1 offered 1 Sheep (Value: 12) for 3 Ore (Value: 3*37 = 111). This trade is not favorable because it results in a loss of value (111 - 12 = 99).\n\n## Step 5: Consider alternative trades based on the current resources and Player 1's previous offers.\nSince the last offer from Player 1 was 1 Sheep for 3 Ore, and it was not favorable, we need to think about what we can offer that might be more appealing or what we can request.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the potential for a new offer.\nGiven that Sheep is valued at 12 and Ore at 37, trading Ore for Sheep seems unfavorable. Consider offering resources of lower value for Sheep or other valuable resources.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a new trade offer.\nConsidering the values, offering Wood (Value: 10) for Sheep (Value: 12) could be beneficial. We previously offered 3 Wood for 1 Sheep and were rejected, and then 2 Wood for 1 Sheep was also rejected. Let's try a more balanced offer or think about requesting something else.\n\n## Step 8: Think about the resources Player 1 might be willing to give up.\nSince Player 1 was not willing to give up Sheep for less than 3 Ore or 4 Wood, they might value Sheep highly or have an abundance of Ore or Wood. We should consider what else they might be willing to trade.\n\n## Step 9: Decide on a new trade offer.\nLet's consider offering something valuable for a resource that is either valuable or needed. We could offer Brick (Value: 22) for Sheep (Value: 12), which is not advantageous, or look for another combination.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the turn limit and decide on the next action.\nThe game is on turn 7 (since turns are not explicitly counted but we can infer from the interactions), and we have 3 turns left. We should make a strategic offer.\n\n## Step 11: Consider accepting the last offer made by Player 1.\nAccepting 1 Sheep for 3 Ore: We have 25 Ore, and giving up 3 Ore for 1 Sheep means losing 111 - 12 = 99 in value. This is still not a good trade.\n\n## Step 12: Formulate a more strategic offer for the next turn.\nLet's directly propose a trade that could be beneficial. For example, '[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Sheep]' because Brick is relatively valuable, and Sheep is needed. The value of 2 Brick is 44, and 1 Sheep is 12, so it's not a good deal. Let's think about other combinations.\n\n## Step 13: Finalize a trade offer for this turn.\nLet's offer something that might be more appealing: '[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep]'. Here, we're offering 1 Brick (Value: 22) and 1 Wood (Value: 10), totaling 32, for 1 Sheep (Value: 12). This is still not a good trade for us.\n\n## Step 14: Reconsider the trade offer based on the value.\nLet's directly calculate the value of the resources and think about a reasonable trade. We need to think about what we can offer that is less valuable than what we request.\n\nThe final answer is [Offer: 3 Ore -> 1 Sheep].",
