Looking at our starting positions, I see we both have some room for optimization. I'm interested in acquiring more Ore and Brick since these are the most valuable resources. In exchange, I can offer some Wheat, Wood, or Sheep.\n\nI'm particularly looking to trade my 24 Wheat at 5 value each. Would you be interested in trading some your valuable resources?
