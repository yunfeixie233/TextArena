      "response": "Okay, I understand the game. My goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I need to propose trades or accept advantageous ones. I will keep track of my current resources and their values.\n\nMy current resources and values:\n*   [Wheat]: 21 units (Value: 6 per unit)\n*   [Wood]: 16 units (Value: 12 per unit)\n*   [Sheep]: 6 units (Value: 14 per unit)\n*   [Brick]: 7 units (Value: 28 per unit)\n*   [Ore]: 22 units (Value: 38 per unit)\n\nLet's calculate my current total value to have a baseline.\n(21 * 6) + (16 * 12) + (6 * 14) + (7 * 28) + (22 * 38)\n126 + 192 + 84 + 196 + 836 = 1434\n\nMy strategy will be to trade low-value items for high-value items, or to trade items I have in abundance for items that are valuable.\n\nLet's start by making an offer. I have a lot of Ore and Wheat. Brick and Sheep are relatively high value for their quantity. I could try to get more high-value items like Brick or Ore.\n\nI have 21 Wheat (value 6) and 22 Ore (value 38).\nI have 7 Brick (value 28) and 6 Sheep (value 14).\n\nI have a feeling that my opponent might want Ore since it's the highest value.\nI also have a relative abundance of Wheat.\n\nLet's try to turn some Wheat into something more valuable. What if I offer some Wheat and try to get Brick or Sheep?\n\nConsider: 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Brick (28) - That's not great.\nConsider: 5 Wheat (30) for 2 Sheep (28) - This looks about fair, but doesn't increase value much.\n\nLet's try to get more high-value resources. I want to increase my total value significantly.\nMy most valuable resource is Ore. I have 22 of them. My least valuable is Wheat.\n\nI will try to trade some Wheat and Wood (mid-value) for Brick or Ore.\n\nOffer 1: Try to get Brick.\nI have plenty of Wood (16 units, value 12). If I can trade 2-3 Wood for 1 Brick (value 28), that would be good.\n2 Wood = 24. 1 Brick = 28. (Slight gain for me)\n3 Wood = 36. If they give me 1 Brick for 3 Wood, I'm losing value.\n\nLet's try to trade less valuable resources for more valuable ones, aiming for a net positive value gain.\n\n**Turn 1: Offer**\n\nI have a lot of Ore. Maybe I can leverage that to get more Brick, which is also valuable and I have less of it. Or maybe get more Sheep.\n\nLet's make an offer that feels slightly advantageous to me but could be appealing.\nI'll offer some Wheat and Wood for Brick.\n\nCurrent plan: Offer 5 Wheat (30 value) + 2 Wood (24 value) = 54 value\nRequest: 2 Brick (56 value)\n\nThis is a slight gain for me (2 value) per trade, but it moves low-value goods into high-value goods.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick]",

This offer was rejected. My goal is to increase my total value.\n\nSince Player 1 rejected my previous offer and made no counter-offer, I need to try a different strategy. I have a lot of Ore and Wheat, which are 38 and 6 respectively. Brick is 28. Player 1 might value Brick more than I do, or they just didn't like the ratio.\n\nI want to acquire more high-value items like Brick or potentially more Sheep, and perhaps trade away some of my abundant Wheat or even some Wood.\n\nLet's try a simpler offer targeting a high-value item, maybe using some Ore which I have plenty of and is quite valuable. I have a lot of Ore and need to make sure I don't give away too much value for too little in return.\n\nPerhaps offer some Ore for Brick, or a combination of lower value items for Brick.\nI could try to trade 1 Ore (38) for 1 Brick (28), and ask for something small in return to make it worthwhile for me, or just accept a small loss for a high value item exchange. But ideally, I want to gain value.\n\nLet's look at the current resources again:\n- Wheat: 21 (Value 6)\n- Wood: 16 (Value 12)\n- Sheep: 6 (Value 14)\n- Brick: 7 (Value 28)\n- Ore: 22 (Value 38)\n\nMaybe I can offer Wheat and get Brick.\n5 Wheat = 30. 1 Brick = 28. This is a very slight gain for me. This seemed like a good deal but was rejected.\nMaybe Player 1 needs Wood?\n\nLet me try to get some Sheep or Brick. I have plenty of Ore.\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore (38) for 1 Brick (28) and 1 Wood (12)? 28 + 12 = 40. This is a gain of 2.\nMy current value of Ore is very high, so I want to avoid trading it for less value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Player 1 wants some Ore. If I offer 1 Ore for 2 Brick (56), that's a good gain, but probably too much to ask.\n\nLet's reconsider the previous offer. Maybe the quantities were too small.\n5 Wheat (30) + 2 Wood (24) = 54. I asked for 2 Brick (56). This was a small gain.\nIf Player 1 rejected an offer where they received 54 value and gave 56 value, they truly didn't want the items or wanted more from me.\n\nLet's try a different item type. What about Sheep? I only have 6 Sheep.\nIf Player 1 offered something, I don't know what they value.\n\nLet's try to offload some Wheat and get Brick.\nWhat if I offer 10 Wheat (60) for 2 Brick (56) and 1 Wood (12)? Total 68. This is a loss of 8 for me.\nI have a lot of Wheat. Perhaps player 1 just wants Wheat.\n\nLet's try to simplify the offer. I have a lot of Wheat and Ore.\nWhat if I try to trade Ore for Brick directly?\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Wheat] (38 -> 28 + 6 = 34). This is a loss of 4 for me.\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 2 Wheat] (38 -> 28 + 12 = 40). This is a gain of 2 for me.\n\nLet's try this:\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 2 Wheat]\nThis gives me a small gain in value, and trades a high-value item for another high-value item plus a low-value one.\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Brick, 2 Wheat]",
