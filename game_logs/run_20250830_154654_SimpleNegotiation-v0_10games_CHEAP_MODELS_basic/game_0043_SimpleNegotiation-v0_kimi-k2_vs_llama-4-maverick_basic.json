Total value = 24 + 50 = 74.\n- Requested resources: 2 Ore (2*35 = 70), 1 Brick (1*23 = 23). Total value = 70 + 23 = 93.\n\n## Step 3: Decide whether to accept or deny the current offer based on the value exchange.\nThe total value of the resources Player 1 is requested to give (2 Ore, 1 Brick) is 93, and the total value of the resources received (4 Wheat, 5 Wood) is 74. Since 74 < 93, accepting this offer would decrease the total value of Player 1's resources.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the appropriate action based on the decision.\nSince accepting the offer results in a decrease in the total value of resources, the optimal decision is to deny the offer.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a response according to the game's action format.\nTo deny the offer, the response should be '[Deny]'.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Deny]}$",
