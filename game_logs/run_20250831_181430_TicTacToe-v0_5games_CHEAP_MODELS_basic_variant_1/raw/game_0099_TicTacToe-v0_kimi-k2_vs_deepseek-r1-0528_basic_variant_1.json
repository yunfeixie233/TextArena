You are competing as Player 0.\nVictory is achieved by claiming three consecutive squares in any direction: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.\nTo make your move, choose a numbered position (0-8) on the grid and submit it in brackets.\nExample: '[7]' will claim the bottom-right corner of the board.\n\nYour battle symbol is 'O', while your opponent fights with 'X'.\n\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [0]  \n\ud83e\udde0 As Player 1 (X), I need to counter Player 0's opening center move (O at 4).
