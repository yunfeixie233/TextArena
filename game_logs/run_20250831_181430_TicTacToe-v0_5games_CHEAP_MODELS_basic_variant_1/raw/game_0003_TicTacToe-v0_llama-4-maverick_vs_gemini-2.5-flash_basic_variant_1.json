My previous move `[0]` was intended to be correct, but there was a misunderstanding in the communication about which cell was occupied. The error message indicated \"cell 4 is already occupied\", which is true for 'O', but I was making a move for 'X'. I need to make sure I am selecting a position from the `Available Moves`.\n\nGiven that 'O' is at `[4]`, a strong counter-strategy is to take a corner. All corner positions (`[0]`, `[2]`, `[6]`, `[8]`) are available.
