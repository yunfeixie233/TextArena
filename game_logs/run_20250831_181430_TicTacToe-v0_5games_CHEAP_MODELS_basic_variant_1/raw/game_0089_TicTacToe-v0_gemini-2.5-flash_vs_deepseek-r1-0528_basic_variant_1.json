Only [5] blocks this threat.  \n\n### Why other moves lose:  \n- If I play [6], Player 0 immediately wins with [5] (O-O-O in the middle row).  \n\n### Strategy:  \n- Claiming [5] neutralizes O\u2019s winning move and leaves only position 6 open.  \n- Player 0 will take position 6 next, ending the game in a draw\u2014no victory for either player.  \n\n**Move:** Blocking the win is mandatory.

Now, only one spot remains: [6].\n\nAt this point, playing [6] will complete the board.
