However, I should also think about controlling the remaining corners or creating a potential winning line.\n\nLet's evaluate the available corners and other strategic positions:\n- Top-right corner: position 2\n- Bottom-left corner: position 6\n\nClaiming position 2 could lead to a potential diagonal or be part of a different winning line, while position 6 could also be a good corner to secure.\n\nAfter considering the available options, I'll choose to place my 'X' in position 2, the top-right corner.\n\nMy move: `[2]`\n\nHere is the move: `[2]`\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  The current board shows the opponent with 'X' in positions 0 and 2, while I have 'O' in positions 4 and 8.
