I want the third cell on that diagonal\u2014cell 0\u2014to complete it, but it\u2019s taken by \u201cX\u201d.  \n  Therefore that diagonal can never help me.\n\n- On the anti-diagonal (2\u20134\u20136) I need 6 to match my \u201cO\u201ds at 4 and 2 (but 2 is \u201cX\u201d, so no).  \n\n- The only unblocked line of three I could still make is the rightmost vertical:  \n  2-5-8.  2 is \u201cX\u201d, 8 is \u201cO\u201d; therefore 5 alone would NOT give a line of three for anyone.  \n\n- Crucially:  the center column 1-4-7 is already O-O, so 7 would give me three in a row!  \n\nSo the game-winning play is immediately at:\n\n[7]",
