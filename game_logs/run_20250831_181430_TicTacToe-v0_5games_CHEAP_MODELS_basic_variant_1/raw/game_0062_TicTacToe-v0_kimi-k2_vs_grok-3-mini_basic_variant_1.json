I must block the top row first\u2014placing O at 1. This also keeps my own fork plan alive along diagonals 0-4-8 (already two O\u2019s) and the column 2-5-8.\n\n[1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  I am Player 1 with 'X', recognizing the critical threat in the middle column where you have two O's ready to win; I must block at 7 to prevent your immediate victory and keep the board balanced for my counterattack.  \n\n[7]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]'\n[Player 0]  My middle-column threat (1-4-7) has been blocked at 7, so I pivot to the last available winning line: the vertical 2-5-8.
