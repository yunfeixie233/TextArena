However, the top row is already occupied, so I'll focus on developing 'O's position.\n\nPosition 3 is adjacent to 'O' (at position 4) and is a potential move because it could help create a line or block 'X' if 'X' expands downward.\n\nPosition 5 is also a potential move as it's adjacent to 'O' (at position 4) on the right side.\n\nLet's analyze further:\n- If I choose position 3, it could help in creating a potential line or blocking 'X' if 'X' moves to position 6 or other adjacent positions.\n- If I choose position 5, it could help 'O' by potentially creating a line or supporting the center.\n\nHowever, a more strategic move is needed to counter 'X's potential top-row win or to develop 'O's chances.\n\nLet's pick position 3 for the next move as it is a relatively safe position that could help 'O' in the future.\n\nMy move is: [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'",
