The opponent's position 0 is also strategic, indicating they might be trying to get a diagonal (0-4-8) or top row (0-1-2) or left column (0-3-6) win.\n\nI should block the opponent's potential winning lines while creating my own.\nIf I place 'O' at '8', it completes my diagonal (0-O-8) and could also set me up for a win if the opponent picks '2' or '6'.\nHowever, this might be a trap from the opponent. The opponent expects me to go for '8' to set up a diagonal.\nInstead, I can play defensively and try to get a win from another direction.\nBy placing 'O' at '2', I create a potential win in the top row (X-?-O) and prevent the opponent from getting 0-1-2.\nIf I place at '6', the opponent would try to block my 0-3-6 horizontal line.\n\nAnother good move could be '[2]', to set up a horizontal line with '1' and block the opponent's potential line from '0' to '2'.\nLet's consider what happens if I place 'O' at '2'.\nCurrent X at 0, O at 4.\nIf I choose 2, the board will be:\nX | 1 | O\n---+---+---\n3 | O | 5\n---+---+---\n6 | 7 | 8\n\nThis move is good because:\n1.
