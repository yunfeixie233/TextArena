      "observation": "\n[GAME] You are Player 0 in Tic Tac Toe.\nYour goal is to win three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the board.\nOn your turn, you should select the square number (0-8) you want to put your mark in next.\nFor example, '[4]' places your mark in the center cell of the board.\n\nAs Player 0, you will be 'O', while your opponent is 'X'.\n\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] I'll place my mark 'O' in the center square to gain control of the board.\n\n[4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] To counter Player 0's center move and maximize strategic advantage, the optimal first move is to occupy a corner cell. Corners offer the highest potential for multiple winning lines. Selecting cell 0 creates an immediate diagonal threat (0-4-8) and positions well for a row (0-1-2) or column (0-3-6).\n\n[0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To block Player 1's potential diagonal threat and maintain my strategy, I will place my mark 'O' in cell 8.\n\n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  After analyzing the board and Player 0's moves, the strategic priority is to control multiple winning lines while preventing opponents from creating forks. With X at 0 and O at 4 and 8, occupying corner 2 creates a strong top row threat (0-1-2) and maintains flexibility for future moves. Edges like 1 or 3 are less ideal as they offer fewer winning opportunities and could allow Player 0 to create a fork.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  To block Player 1's potential vertical threat in the top row and maintain control, I will place my mark 'O' in cell 1.\n\n[1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] Given the current board:\n\n- Top row: X (cell 0), O (cell 1), X (cell 2) \u2014 no winning opportunity.\n- Middle row: Empty (cell 3), O (cell 4), empty (cell 5) \u2014 Player 0 has one O here, no immediate threat.\n- Bottom row: Empty (cell 6), empty (cell 7), O (cell 8) \u2014 Player 0 could threaten next.\n\nColumn analysis:\n- Column 1 (cells 1, 4, 7) has two O\u2019s (cell 1 and cell 4). If Player 0 places in cell 7, they win vertically. **This is an immediate winning threat that must be blocked.**\n\nDiagonals:\n- Main diagonal (0-4-8): X at 0, O at 4, O at 8 \u2014 no win possible.\n- Other diagonal (2-4-6): X at 2, O at 4, empty at 6 \u2014 no threat, as Player 0 cannot win here.\n\nMy potential threats:\n- No two-in-a-row for me to expand immediately. Playing at 3 or 6 would create a future threat in column 0 (0 and 3, or 0 and 6), but ignoring cell 7 risks instant loss.\n\n**Conclusion:** Cell 7 is the only move that blocks Player 0's guaranteed win.
