'O' has occupied the center cell and now has two other 'O's on the board, one in the top left and one in the bottom left, which makes a strong vertical presence on the left side.\n\nSince 'O' has a strong presence on the left side and has occupied the center, my priority should be to counter their potential win while setting up my own potential win.\n\nNoting that 'O' has three 'O's in a potential win condition if they get to place their next 'O' in cell [3], I should prioritize blocking their potential three 'O's in a row. \n\nLet's place my 'X' in cell [3] to block 'O's potential win.\n\nMy move: [3]\n\nThis will result in the following board:\n\n O | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | 8 \n\nBy doing so, I'm not only blocking 'O's potential win but also preparing to potentially create a winning line for myself in the next moves.\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[5]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] After analyzing the current board, I see two immediate threats and opportunities:\n\n1. **Fork Creation**: Placing my 'O' at position [8] creates a game-winning fork:\n   - Threatens win via the diagonal [0,4,8] (by taking 0 next)\n   - Threatens win via the bottom row [6,7,8] (by taking 7 next)\n   The opponent (X) can only block one threat next turn, guaranteeing my win on the following move.\n\n2. **Alternatives Weaker**: \n   - [0] creates only one threat (diagonal [0,4,8])\n   - [1] creates a column threat ([1,4,7]) but is easily blocked\n   - [5] or [7] create no immediate threats\n\nMy optimal move forces victory regardless of the opponent's response.\n\n**[8]**\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To make my next move, I need to analyze the current state of the board and choose the best available square.\n\nThe current state of the board is:\n\n 0 | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | O \n\nAs 'X', my goal is to win or at least make a strategic move that could potentially lead to a win or force a draw. 'O' has a strong presence and has just made a move that creates a potential fork, threatening to win in two different ways.\n\nFirst, let's assess the threats:\n1. 'O' has a potential win via the diagonal [0,4,8] by taking 0 next.\n2. 'O' also has a potential win via the bottom row [6,7,8] by taking 7 next.\n\nTo counter this, I need to block one of these potential wins. Since 'O' has 'O's in positions [6] and [8], and 'X' is in [3], my priority is to place my next 'X' in a position that blocks one of 'O's potential wins and also looks for an opportunity to counter-attack.\n\nLet's analyze the available moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[5]', '[7]'.\n\n- Placing 'X' in [0] would block the diagonal win and is a crucial block.\n- Placing 'X' in [1] doesn't immediately block a win but keeps the option open.\n- Placing 'X' in [5] could be a potential move to develop my own line.\n- Placing 'X' in [7] would block the bottom row win.\n\nTo counter 'O's fork, I should prioritize either [0] to block the diagonal or [7] to block the row. \n\nLet's prioritize [0] because it directly counters one of the threats and is a more immediate threat to 'O's potential win condition.\n\nMy move: [0]\n\nThis will result in the following board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n X | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | 7 | O \n\nBy doing so, I'm blocking 'O's diagonal win and setting up my own potential wins or forcing a draw.\n[GAME] Player 1 attempted an invalid move.
