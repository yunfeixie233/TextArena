Although this move doesn't secure an immediate win for me, it prevents Player 0 from winning in the next turn and keeps the game going.\n\nNo other move is safe:\n- Playing in 3, 5, or 7 would allow Player 0 to play in 6 and win on their next turn.\n\nThus, I choose cell 6.\n\n[6]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  Analyzing the board:  \n- Opponent (O) has two immediate winning threats:  \n  1. Middle row (cells 3,4,5): Placing O in cell 5 wins horizontally.  \n  2. Column 2 (cells 2,5,8): Placing O in cell 5 wins vertically.  \n- My move **must block both threats** simultaneously by occupying cell 5.  \n- Alternative moves (cell 3 or 7) allow O to win next turn and are unsafe.  \n\nBest move: `[5]` (block opponent's win threat).  \n\n[5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[7]'",
