The opposite corner to 0 is 8, which completes the main diagonal (0-4-8) and forces the opponent into a defensive position. \n\nThis aligns with standard strategy:  \n- First player secures the center.  \n- If opponent takes a corner, first player takes the opposite corner to prevent a potential fork and maintain board dominance.  \n\nThus, I place my mark (O) in cell 8.  \n\n**[8]**\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  I will take cell 2 to create a potential win condition and block the opponent's diagonal.\n\n**[2]**\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] ### Analysis of Current Board State:\n- The board is in a critical state after Player 1 (X) played **cell 2**, creating an immediate threat:  \n  - The top row (cells 0, 1, 2) now has **X** (cell 0), **empty** (cell 1), **X** (cell 2).
