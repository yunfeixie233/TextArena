      "observation": "\n[GAME] You are Player 0 in Tic Tac Toe.\nYour goal is to win three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the board.\nOn your turn, you should select the square number (0-8) you want to put your mark in next.\nFor example, '[4]' places your mark in the center cell of the board.\n\nAs Player 0, you will be 'O', while your opponent is 'X'.\n\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] Based on the current board, I need to make a strategic move as 'X' to set up a win. The opponent ('O') has taken the center (4), which is a strong position. To counter this, I should secure a corner spot because they offer more winning opportunities (multiple ways to form three in a row). The corners are positions 0, 2, 6, or 8. \n\nI'll choose the top-left corner (0) to maximize control. This creates a potential diagonal threat (0-4-8) and a horizontal threat (0-1-2). \n\n[0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0]  With the center (4) secured as 'O', and the opponent ('X') in corner 0, I need to take another corner to create multiple threats and block potential opponent wins. Position 8 is ideal as it opposes their move, potentially setting up a diagonal or row for me.

If I don't block position 1 immediately, they will win on their next turn. My priority is to prevent that while positioning myself for future opportunities. I'll play in position 1 to block their win and also set up potential vertical or horizontal lines for my O's.\n\n[1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] Based on the current board and the immediate threat of Player 0 (O) winning by completing the center column (positions 1-4-7), I must prioritize blocking that winning move. Placing my mark (X) at position 7 is the only critical action here, as failing to do so would result in an instant loss on Player 0's next turn. \n\nAfter blocking:\n- The center column threat is neutralized (positions 1, 4, 7 now contain O, O, X).\n- No immediate winning opportunities exist for either player, but future moves will focus on creating forks or forcing errors.\n\n**Move: [7]**  \n*(Blocks O's center-column win while setting groundwork for later plays)*\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]'\n[Player 0] With X controlling positions 0, 2, and 7, they have a potential threat in the first column (positions 0, 3, 6), where they already have X in 0 and could win by playing in 3 and then 6 if not blocked. My priority is to block this immediate threat while creating a winning opportunity for myself. Playing in position 3 blocks their first column and also sets up two O's in the middle row (positions 3, 4, 5), giving me a chance to win on my next turn if unblocked.\n\n[3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]'\n[Player 1]  The current board shows an urgent threat: if Player 0 (O) claims position 5, they win by completing the middle row (positions 3-4-5). To prevent an immediate loss, I must block this by placing my X at position 5. This also sets a defensive position with no immediate win for either side, likely leading to a draw after the final move at 6.  \n\n**[5]**\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[6]'",
      "response": "With the board nearly full and only position 6 available, placing my 'O' there blocks any potential for the opponent to claim it and prevents a draw from turning into a loss for them. Although this doesn't immediately win the game for me, it completes the board and likely results in a draw, as no three in a row is possible for either player after this move.\n\n[6]",
