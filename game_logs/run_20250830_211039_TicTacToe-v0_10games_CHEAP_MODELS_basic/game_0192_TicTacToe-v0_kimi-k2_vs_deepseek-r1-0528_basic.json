Therefore, I **must block cell 7** immediately, as it is the only winning threat on the board. \n\nAfter blocking, the board becomes:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nPlayer 0 will then have to respond to future threats, but with no immediate win conditions left, the game remains competitive. \n\n[MOVE SELECTION]  \nBlocking is forced. Selecting the only critical defensive move: **7**.\n\n[7]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]'\n[Player 0] All lines are blocked for us, but there\u2019s still one move that instantly forks two winning lines: top-left corner (3) gives us threats in both the left column and the anti-diagonal. Taking it is decisive.\n\n[3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]'\n[Player 1] [GAME PLAY THOUGHT]  \nPlayer 0 (O) has created an imminent winning threat: if they take cell 5, they complete row 1 (cells 3,4,5) for a win. I must block this by taking cell 5. No other move prevents defeat. After blocking, the board will be a draw since no winning lines remain open.  \n\n[MOVE SELECTION]  \nDefensive priority: **5** is the only move that stops Player 0 from winning.  \n\n[5]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 5.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | X \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[6]'",
