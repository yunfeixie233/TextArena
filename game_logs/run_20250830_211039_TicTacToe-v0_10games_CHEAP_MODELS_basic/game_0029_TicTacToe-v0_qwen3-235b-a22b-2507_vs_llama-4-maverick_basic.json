      "observation": "\n[GAME] You are Player 0 in Tic Tac Toe.\nYour goal is to win three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the board.\nOn your turn, you should select the square number (0-8) you want to put your mark in next.\nFor example, '[4]' places your mark in the center cell of the board.\n\nAs Player 0, you will be 'O', while your opponent is 'X'.\n\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] To make my move as 'X', I will analyze the current state of the board and the available moves.\n\nThe current board is:\n \n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nThe available moves are: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n\nSince the opponent has placed their 'O' in cell 4, a strategic move would be to place my 'X' in a position that could potentially lead to a win or limit their winning possibilities.\n\nA good starting move for 'X' is to occupy a corner or a position that is not directly adjacent to 'O' if possible, to start building a potential row or to create flexibility for the next move.\n\nLet's choose a corner. The available corners are 0, 2, 6, and 8. Placing 'X' in position 8 (a corner) could be a good move as it is somewhat distant from 'O', and it opens up possibilities for future moves.\n\nSo, I will place my 'X' in cell [8].\n\nMy move is: [8]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [4]\n[GAME] Player 0 attempted an invalid move.

The available corners are 2 and 6. \n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n1. Placing 'X' in position 2 (a corner) could be a good move.\n2. Placing 'X' in position 6 (a corner) could also be strategic.\n\nBetween these, both moves have merit, but I will choose one that allows for future flexibility and potentially puts pressure on 'O's position.\n\nSo, I will place my 'X' in cell [2].\n\nMy move is: [2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To make my next move as 'X', I will analyze the current state of the board and the available moves.\n\nThe current board is:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nThe available moves are: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n\nSince my last move was incorrectly stated as being in cell 2 but actually was in cell 1, and the opponent has now placed their 'O' in cell 2, I need to continue with a strategic plan.\n\nNoticing that 'X' is in cells 0 and 1, a good next step is to continue playing in a way that could potentially lead to a win or limit 'O's winning possibilities.\n\nLet's examine the available options:\n\n1. Placing 'X' in position 3 could be a good move as it continues the row started by 'X' in cell 0 and 1.\n2. Placing 'X' in position 7 could be strategic as it puts 'X' in a position to potentially win or block 'O' in the future.\n\nBetween these, placing 'X' in position 3 seems like a strong move as it is adjacent to 'X' in cell 1 and could potentially lead to a win.\n\nSo, I will place my 'X' in cell [3].\n\nMy move is: [3]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n X | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'",
