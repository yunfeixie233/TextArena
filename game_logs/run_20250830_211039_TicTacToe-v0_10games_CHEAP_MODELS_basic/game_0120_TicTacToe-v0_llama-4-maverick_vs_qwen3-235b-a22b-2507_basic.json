      "observation": "\n[GAME] You are Player 0 in Tic Tac Toe.\nYour goal is to win three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the board.\nOn your turn, you should select the square number (0-8) you want to put your mark in next.\nFor example, '[4]' places your mark in the center cell of the board.\n\nAs Player 0, you will be 'O', while your opponent is 'X'.\n\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To determine the best move, let's consider the current state of the board and the available moves.\n\nThe current board looks like this:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAs 'O', my goal is to win or block 'X' from winning while trying to create a winning opportunity.\n\n1. **Center Control**: The center square (4) is a strategic position because it gives the most flexibility for the next move. It is involved in multiple potential winning combinations.\n\n2. **Current State**: Since the game just started, there's no 'X' or 'O' on the board. \n\nGiven that it's the first move, the optimal strategy is to occupy the center square to maximize future move flexibility.\n\nI will choose square **[4]**.\n\nSo, my move is: [4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To determine the best move, let's analyze the current state of the board and the available moves.\n\nThe current board looks like this:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAs 'O', my goal is to win or block 'X' from winning while trying to create a winning opportunity.\n\n1. **Current State**: The game has just started, and 'X' has made their first move by placing their symbol in cell 0.\n\n2. **'X' Position**: 'X' is currently in cell 0. I need to consider how to respond to this move and continue with my strategy.\n\n3. **My Previous Move**: I occupied the center square (4) with 'O', which is a strategic position for flexibility.\n\n4. **Available Moves**: I have several options: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'.\n\nGiven that 'X' has started by occupying cell 0, my next move should aim at maintaining control of the center and preparing for future moves. A good strategy is to play in a way that supports the center and potentially prepares for a fork or blocks 'X's potential winning lines.\n\nOne of the available moves that supports my central control and prepares for the next moves is to place 'O' in a position that is adjacent to the center and potentially useful for creating a fork or blocking 'X'. \n\nLet's consider the available moves:\n\n- Placing 'O' in cell 2 could be a good counter-move as it mirrors 'X' and could potentially lead to a fork on the next move.\n- Alternatively, placing 'O' in cell 3 or 5 (adjacent to the center) could be considered as it continues to control the center and prepares for the next moves.\n\nHowever, considering the need to respond to 'X' and maintain flexibility, I will choose a move that is strategic and not directly adjacent to 'X'. \n\nI will choose square **[2]**.\n\nSo, my move is: [2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [4]\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] [2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To determine the best move, let's analyze the current state of the board and the available moves.\n\nThe current board looks like this:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAs 'O', my goal is to win or block 'X' from winning while trying to create a winning opportunity.\n\n1. **Current State**: 'X' has placed their symbol in cell 0 and 2, and I have 'O' in cells 1 and 4.\n\n2. **'X' Position**: 'X' is currently in cells 0 and 2, trying to potentially control the top row.\n\n3. **My Previous Move**: I had 'O' in cell 4 and then placed 'O' in cell 1 (though the game indicates I placed it in cell 1, my intended move was for cell 2, but it was taken by 'X'). The actual last move was supposed to be [2] but it was occupied by 'X'.\n\n4. **Available Moves**: I have several options: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'.\n\nGiven that 'X' has two 'X's and is trying to potentially win, my next move should aim at blocking 'X's winning line or creating a potential winning opportunity for 'O'.\n\nSince 'X' has 'X' in cells 0 and 2, they are trying to control the top row. I should consider a move that could block their potential three 'X's in a row or create a fork.\n\nLet's consider the available moves:\n\n- Placing 'O' in cell 3 or 5 (adjacent to the center) could be a good move as it continues to control the center's influence and prepares for the next moves.\n- Placing 'O' in cell 6, 7, or 8 could be considered to create a potential fork or block 'X's future moves.\n\nTo block 'X' from winning on the top row, I should consider a move that puts pressure on 'X' and creates a potential winning line for 'O'. \n\nOne of the strategic moves is to place 'O' in cell 3 or 5. Let's choose cell **[3]** as it is adjacent to the center and starts to put pressure on 'X's position.\n\nSo, my move is: [3]\n[GAME] Player 0 attempted an invalid move.
