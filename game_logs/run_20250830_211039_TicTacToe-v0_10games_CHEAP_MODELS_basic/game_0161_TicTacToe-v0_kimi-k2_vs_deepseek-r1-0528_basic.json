      "observation": "\n[GAME] You are Player 1 in Tic Tac Toe.\nYour goal is to win three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the board.\nOn your turn, you should select the square number (0-8) you want to put your mark in next.\nFor example, '[4]' places your mark in the center cell of the board.\n\nAs Player 1, you will be 'X', while your opponent is 'O'.\n\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | 4 | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] I am 'O', the opponent is 'X'.  \nNo moves have been made yet, so the board is entirely open.  \nBy going first I should claim the most central, influential square\u2014the center\u2014so I control the largest set of possible winning lines.\n\n[4]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 4.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1] As Player 1 (X), the board shows Player 0 (O) took the center (4). To counter a center-opening effectively, the cornerstone optimal response is claiming a corner. Corners offer maximized winning paths (3 lines each) compared to edges.\n\nSelecting **cell 0** (top-left corner) creates pressure on two immediate winning lines:\n1. **Row 0** (0-1-2) by potentially blocking opponent later\n2. **Diagonal 0-4-8**, forcing O to play defensively next.\n\nThis move also reserves flexibility for future forks while denying O corner control.  \n\n[0]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] There's now an X in the top-left corner (0) and my O in the center (4).  \nThe bottom-right corner (8) forms the same main diagonal with 0 and 4, so placing my O there now would threaten a quick win (0-X, 4-O, 8-O) and put immediate pressure on X.\n\n[8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] As Player 1 (X), the opponent (O) has occupied the center (4) and bottom-right corner (8), while I hold the top-left corner (0). To maximize winning opportunities, I must prioritize corner moves, as they offer the most winning lines (3 per corner). The remaining corners are 2 (top-right) and 6 (bottom-left). \n\nChoosing **cell 2** (top-right corner) creates an immediate threat in Row 0 (cells 0-1-2) by giving me two X's in the row (cells 0 and 2). This forces the opponent to respond defensively by blocking at cell 1 on their next turn, or I win instantly. Additionally, this move pressures the anti-diagonal (2-4-6), though it is partially blocked by O at 4.\n\nThis strategy limits the opponent's options and sets up potential future forks, while avoiding weaker edge moves that offer fewer winning paths. If the opponent fails to block Row 0, I win next turn.\n\n[2]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0]  Player 1 just created a direct threat along the top row: 0-X, 1- , 2-X.  \nTo stop an immediate win, I must block at position 1 immediately.  \nBlocking here denies X the row win and keeps our own diagonal threat (8-O, 4-O) alive for the future.\n\n[1]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] As Player 1 (X), the board shows Player 0 (O) has created a critical threat.

To prevent a loss, I must **block cell 7**. This move also starts building a potential winning line in the **bottom row** (cells 6-7-8).

Since I get to act first, I control the outcome.\n\nTaking **3** sets this plan into motion.\n\n[3]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | X \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[6]'",
