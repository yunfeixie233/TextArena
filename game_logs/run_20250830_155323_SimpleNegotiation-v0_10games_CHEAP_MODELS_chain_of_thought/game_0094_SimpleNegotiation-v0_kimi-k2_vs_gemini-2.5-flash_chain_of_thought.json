This is not a beneficial trade for me.\n\nTherefore, I will deny this offer. I will also make a counter-offer to try and improve my resources. My Brick is highly valuable, and I have a low quantity. My Ore is also very valuable and I have a high quantity. I want to increase my valuable items, like Brick and potentially Sheep. I have a lot of Wheat and Ore, so I could trade those.\n\nI will try to trade some Wheat for Brick, or Ore for Brick. I also have a lot of Sheep. Perhaps I can trade some Sheep and Ore for more Brick.\n\nMy current Brick quantity is 5, which is quite low.\n\nLet's propose: [Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Ore -> 3 Brick, 2 Sheep]\n\nValue of my offer:\n*   10 Wheat (Value: 10 * 6 = 60)\n*   5 Ore (Value: 5 * 32 = 160)\n*   Total = 220\n\nValue of their requested items:\n*   3 Brick (Value: 3 * 28 = 84)\n*   2 Sheep (Value: 2 * 16 = 32)\n*   Total = 116\n\nThis offer is not good enough from my side. I want to gain more value.\n\nLet's try to get Brick. I have a lot of Ore and Wheat. I need more Brick.\nI have plenty of Ore (24) and Wheat (20). I am low on Brick (5).\n\nLet's try to get more valuable items in exchange for less valuable or abundant items.\nHow about trading Ore for Brick and Sheep?\n\nMy value for Ore: 32. My value for Brick: 28. My value for Sheep: 16.\n\n[Offer: 5 Ore -> 4 Brick]\nMy offer value: 5 * 32 = 160\nRequested value: 4 * 28 = 112\nThis is a bad offer for me.\n\nLet's try: [Offer: 3 Ore, 5 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 10 Wood]\nMy offer: 3 * 32 (Ore) + 5 * 16 (Sheep) = 96 + 80 = 176\nTheir request: 3 * 28 (Brick) + 10 * 8 (Wood) = 84 + 80 = 164\nThis is me losing value.\n\nOkay, let's simplify and focus on acquiring more Brick. I am resource-rich in Ore and Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 8 Ore -> 5 Brick]\nMy offer value: 8 * 32 = 256\nRequested value: 5 * 28 = 140\nStill bad for me.

They offer 5 Wood, 3 Sheep.\n\nI need Brick. Player 0 has Brick, given they asked for it.\nI am very hesitant to give up Brick.\n\nOkay, my initial response must be Deny.\n\nAfter denying, I need to make an offer.\nI have a significant amount of Ore and Wheat.
