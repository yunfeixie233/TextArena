If I can obtain Brick cheaply, my total value grows quickly.  \n   - Wheat has the lowest per-unit value (5) and I have the most of it, so I am willing to part with it easily.  \n   - I do not want to part with Ore (highest value) unless I receive a large value premium.\n\n4. **Opening goals**  \n   a. Acquire more Brick.  \n   b. Offer Wheat (cheap) and possibly a modest amount of Ore to get Brick without lowering total value.  \n   c. Keep the offers balanced so I (slightly) gain value on every accepted trade.\n\n5. **Proposed first offer**  \n   Give 3 \u00d7 Wheat + 2 \u00d7 Wood (total value = 3\u00b75 + 2\u00b79 = 33)  \n   In exchange, receive 3 \u00d7 Brick (total value = 3\u00b721 = 63)  \n   Net gain = 63 \u2013 33 = 30 value points.\n\n   Polite verbalization to start negotiations:\n\n---\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick, 0 Sheep]\n\n(\"Hi Player 1, I'm looking to shore up my Brick supply.
