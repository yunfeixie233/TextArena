      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to strategically decide which resources to trade and how. Let's first assess the current total value of my resources.\n\n1. **Calculate the current total value**:\n   - Wheat: 22 * 6 = 132\n   - Wood: 21 * 12 = 252\n   - Sheep: 20 * 17 = 340\n   - Brick: 16 * 24 = 384\n   - Ore: 7 * 37 = 259\n   \n   Total value = 132 + 252 + 340 + 384 + 259 = 1367\n\n2. **Identify the most valuable resources and potential trades**:\n   - The most valuable resources I have are Brick (24 per unit) and Ore (37 per unit).\n   - I should try to keep or acquire more of these if possible.\n\n3. **Consider the first move**:\n   - Since I have a relatively low quantity of Ore (7), I should be cautious about trading it away. \n   - I have a decent quantity of Sheep (20), Brick (16), and Wood (21). Trading some of these for more Ore or Brick could be beneficial.\n\n4. **Formulate a trade offer**:\n   - One potential trade is to offer some Wheat (the least valuable resource per unit) or Sheep in exchange for Ore. However, Wheat is not very valuable, and Sheep, while valuable, is not as valuable as Ore. \n   - I will offer 5 Wood (relatively less valuable compared to others per unit) for 2 Ore. This seems like a good starting point as it doesn't involve giving away very valuable resources or too much quantity.\n\nLet's make the offer: `[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]`.\n\nThis is a calculated risk to start with. Let's see how the opponent responds. \n\nResponse: `[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]`",

      "response": "It seems like we've been trying to negotiate with Player 1 for a while now, but they haven't been receptive to our offers. Let's analyze the current situation and resources.\n\n**Current Resources:**\n- Wheat: 22 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 21 - 11 = 10 (Value: 12)\n- Sheep: 20 (Value: 17)\n- Brick: 16 - 5 = 11 (Value: 24)\n- Ore: 7 + 0 = 7 (Value: 37)\n\nWe've offered a total of 11 Wood and 5 Brick for 3 Ore so far, and Player 1 has rejected all our offers. The last few offers were not significantly different in terms of total value, and it seems like Player 1 is not interested in trading for Ore at the prices we've offered.\n\nLet's think about our next step.\n\n1. **Re-evaluate the goal**: Our goal is to increase the total value of our resources. Ore has the highest value, so acquiring more Ore is a good strategy if possible.\n\n2. **Consider alternative trades**: Since Player 1 is not responding positively to our offers for Ore, we should consider what else they might be interested in. Perhaps they have resources we need, and we can make a trade that benefits both parties.\n\n3. **Make a new offer**: Let's think about what we can offer and what we can request. We could try to trade resources of lower value for Ore or other high-value resources.\n\nGiven the current situation and the fact that we've been focusing on Ore, let's consider making a different kind of trade. We have a significant amount of Sheep, which is the second-highest quantity we have.\n\nLet's make an offer: `[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`.\n\nThis offer gives away 3 Sheep (Value: 17 * 3 = 51) for 1 Ore (Value: 37). While this seems unfavorable at first glance, we've already been trying to get more Ore and haven't been successful with lower quantities. Let's try to think about what Player 1 might have and what they might want.\n\nIf we don't get a positive response, we might need to think about other trade options or consider that Player 1 is not interested in trading.\n\n**Action:** `[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`",
