Denied because:\n     - Player 0 was giving low-value items (Wheat: 10 value for 10 units = 1 value/unit, Wood: 5 value for 5 units = 1 value/unit) for high-value Brick (22/12 \u2248 1.83 value/unit).

Denied implicitly (Player 1 made no new offer).\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Player 0 seems desperate for Brick and possibly Sheep. Their offers so far have been poor.\n   - Player 1 has excess Wood (24 units, low value) and could use more Brick or Sheep to improve total value.\n   - Goal: Trade excess Wood/Wheat for higher-value resources (Brick, Sheep, or Ore).\n\n4. **Counter-offer**:\n   - Offer Player 0 some of my excess Wood for their Brick or Sheep.\n   - Example: Offer 8 Wood (value: 10/24 \u2248 0.42 per unit) for 2 Brick (value: 22/12 \u2248 1.83 per unit) or similar.\n   - Adjust quantities to make it fair or favor Player 1.\n\n5. **Optimal Offer**:\n   - Offer 8 Wood -> 2 Brick. This gives Player 0 needed Wood and lets Player 1 gain 2 Brick (net value increase: 2*1.83 - 8*0.42 \u2248 3.66 - 3.36 = 0.3, slight gain).\n   - Alternatively, offer 12 Wood -> 3 Brick (larger gain: 3*1.83 - 12*0.42 \u2248 5.49 - 5.04 = 0.45).\n\n6. **Chosen Offer**:\n   - Go with 12 Wood for 3 Brick.

It is plausible this becomes a gain.\n\nFinally, the market rarely prices Brick at par with Ore on the open exchange; players usually pay a premium. Three Wheat and two Ore may indeed be perceived as materially better than four Brick by Player 0, so this is a real bargaining-chip rather than a pure loss.\n\n[Offer: 4 Brick -> 3 Wheat, 2 Ore]",
