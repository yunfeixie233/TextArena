The total value of current resources is calculated as follows:\n- Total Value = (21*6) + (14*10) + (21*13) + (19*22) + (22*40)\n- Total Value = 126 + 140 + 273 + 418 + 880 = 1837\n\nThe resources with the highest value per unit are Ore (40) and Brick (22), indicating that holding more of these or acquiring resources of similar or higher value could be beneficial.\n\n### First Turn Strategy\nSince we don't have information about the opponent's resources, we'll start by making a generic offer that could potentially increase our total value. Noting that Ore is our most valuable resource, we should be cautious about trading it away. However, we can consider trading some of our less valuable resources to acquire more valuable ones or to consolidate resources that are more valuable.\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (Value = 6) or Wood (Value = 10) for resources that are more valuable. \n\n### Trade Offer for Turn 1\nWe'll make an offer to trade some of our less valuable resources for something more valuable. For example, offering Wheat for Brick or Ore.\n\n### Action\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\n\nThis offer is an attempt to gain a more valuable resource (Brick) by giving away some of our least valuable resource (Wheat).

This is the same as the previous offer made by Player 1 and was already accepted once. The values are: 2 Sheep = 2 * 13 = 26 and 1 Brick = 22. The offer is not favorable as it gives more value than it receives.\n\n## Step 3: Consider possible trade offers.\nTo increase the total value of resources, we need to consider trades that give more value than they take. Currently, we have a surplus of Sheep relative to Brick. Let's examine potential trades:\n- Trading Sheep for Brick: Not favorable as seen before (2 Sheep = 26, 1 Brick = 22).\n- Trading other resources for something more valuable.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the current resources and their values to identify potential trades.\nLet's analyze the resources and their total values:\n- Total Wheat value: 21 * 6 = 126\n- Total Wood value: 14 * 10 = 140\n- Total Sheep value: 23 * 13 = 299\n- Total Brick value: 18 * 22 = 396\n- Total Ore value: 22 * 40 = 880\nTotal value = 126 + 140 + 299 + 396 + 880 = 1841\n\n## Step 5: Propose a new trade offer based on the current resources and the goal to increase total value.\nConsidering the values, Ore is the most valuable resource. Trading something less valuable for Ore or maintaining Ore could be beneficial. Let's consider giving away resources that are less valuable for Ore or more valuable resources.\n\n## Step 6: Formulate a trade offer.\nGiven that Player 1 is willing to give 2 Sheep for 1 Brick, which we already know is not a good deal for us, we need to think of an alternative. One potential trade could involve offering something for Ore. For instance, offering Brick (the second most valuable resource per unit after Ore) for Ore.\n\n## Step 7: Create a specific trade offer.\nLet's propose: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]. The value given is 22 (1 Brick), and the value received is 40 (1 Ore). This is a favorable trade.\n\n## Step 8: Format the trade offer according to the game's special tokens.\nThe trade offer is: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
