Offer 1: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore\n   - Value Given: 2*10 + 1*6 = 26\n   - Value Received: 1*37 = 37\n   - Net Gain: +11 (but rejected by me)\n2. Offer 2: 1 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore\n   - Value Given: 1*12 + 2*10 = 32\n   - Value Received: 1*37 = 37\n   - Net Gain: +5 (but rejected by me)\n3. Offer 3: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick\n   - Value Given: 1*10 + 1*12 = 22\n   - Value Received: 1*25 = 25\n   - Net Gain: +3 (but rejected by me)\n\nAll these offers were technically beneficial in terms of pure value, but I rejected them possibly because I was being conservative or waiting for better deals. However, rejecting all offers is not productive. I need to start making or accepting trades to increase my total value.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward\n\nPlayer 0 seems willing to offer trades where they give higher-value items for relatively lower-value ones (from their perspective). However, their offers are not particularly generous. I should:\n\n1. **Make a favorable offer to Player 0** that gives them some resources they seem to value (Wood/Wheat/Sheep) in exchange for Brick or Ore, which are more valuable to me.\n2. **Offer slightly more appealing trade to Player 0** than their previous offers to me, since they rejected my last \"no offer\".\n\n### Identifying Player 0's Preferences\n\nFrom their offers:\n- They seem to want Ore (offered resources to get Ore twice).\n- They are offering Brick (they may have excess Brick and want other resources).\n\nThus, I should try to acquire more Brick or Ore from them by offering them Wood/Wheat/Sheep.\n\n### Making a New Offer\n\nI have good quantities of Wood (17) and Sheep (15), which seem to be of interest to Player 0. I can spare some Sheep since 15 is a high count relative to its value (12). Brick is high value (25) and I currently have 19, but trading for more is good.\n\nOffer:\nGive 3 Sheep (value 3*12 = 36) and get 2 Brick (value 2*25 = 50)\nNet gain: +14 for me, and 36 vs 50 seems like a decent deal for Player 0 to consider (they might accept if they value Sheep higher or Brick lower).\n\nHowever, to be more balanced and ensure they accept, maybe tone it down slightly:\nGive 3 Sheep for 1 Brick + 1 Wheat (but Wheat is low value for me, not ideal).\n\nBetter:\nGive 2 Sheep (2*12 = 24) for 1 Brick (25) and 1 Wood (10)\nBut this is 24 vs 35, too generous to Player 0.\n\nRefined Offer:\nGive 3 Sheep for 2 Brick: 36 vs 50, net +14 for me. Probably the best balance.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",
