      "response": "Given the history, I've noticed successful trades when offering Wheat for higher-value resources like Brick and Ore. My current resources are:\n\n- Wheat: 10 (Value: 5 each)  \n- Wood: 11 (Value: 8 each)  \n- Sheep: 7 (Value: 17 each)  \n- Brick: 14 (Value: 23 each)  \n- Ore: 26 (Value: 33 each)  \n\nTotal value: **1,437**  \n\nTo increase my total value, I'll propose a trade that leverages my lower-value resources (Wheat/Wood) for high-value Ore. Player 1 previously accepted 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore (net +8 value for me), but rejected the same offer later. To make this more appealing, I'll add Wood to increase the offered value while maintaining a net gain for me.  \n\n**Proposed Trade**:  \n- I offer: **4 Wheat + 1 Wood** (Total value: 4\u00d75 + 1\u00d78 = 28)  \n- I request: **1 Ore** (Value: 33)  \n- **Net gain for me**: +5 value  \n\nThis is better than my prior 5 Wheat offer (25 value) and may address Player 1's changing needs. If accepted, my new total value becomes **1,442**.  \n\n\"Player 1, I\u2019m offering a bundle of Wheat and Wood for Ore\u2014this gives you versatile resources while helping me consolidate. What do you think?\"  \n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
