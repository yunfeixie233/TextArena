However, we need to be cautious about what Player 1 is willing to accept or offer.\n\nLet's make an offer that involves trading lower-value resources for potentially higher-value ones. For example, we could offer:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (4*6) + (2*8) = 24 + 16 = 40 for 1 Ore worth 37. This is not a good trade in terms of value. Let's think of a better option.\n\nConsidering the values, another option could be:\n'[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick]'\n\nHere, we give away 2 Sheep worth 2*12 = 24 for 3 Brick worth 3*29 = 87. This is a gain of 63 in value.\n\nGiven the current situation and the potential for gain, the action will be:\n'[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick]'",
