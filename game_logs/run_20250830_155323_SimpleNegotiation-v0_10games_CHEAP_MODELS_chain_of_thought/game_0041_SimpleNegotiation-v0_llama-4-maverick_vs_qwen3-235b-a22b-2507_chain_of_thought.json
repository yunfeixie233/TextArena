      "response": "### Negotiation Game Strategy for Player0\n\n#### Initial Assessment\n- Current resources and their total value:\n  - Wheat: 15 units, Value: 5/unit, Total = 75\n  - Wood: 11 units, Value: 12/unit, Total = 132\n  - Sheep: 18 units, Value: 17/unit, Total = 306\n  - Brick: 14 units, Value: 25/unit, Total = 350\n  - Ore: 22 units, Value: 38/unit, Total = 836\n- Total value of resources = 75 + 132 + 306 + 350 + 836 = 1699\n\n#### Strategy\nTo increase the total value of resources, we need to identify which resources are undervalued or overvalued relative to others and make trades accordingly. \n\n1. **Value Analysis**: \n   - The resources with the highest value per unit are Ore (38) and Brick (25), indicating they are highly valued.\n   - Sheep (17) and Wood (12) are moderately valued.\n   - Wheat (5) is the lowest valued.\n\n2. **Trade Strategy**:\n   - We should aim to trade resources with lower value for those with higher value if possible.\n   - Given our current resources, we have a good amount of Ore, which is highly valued. We can consider trading some of our abundant resources for other resources that might be undervalued in our collection or for more of the highly valued resources.\n\n#### Initial Trade Offer\nLet's start by making an offer that could potentially increase our total value. We have a significant amount of Sheep and Ore. Let's consider trading some Sheep (17/unit) for more Brick (25/unit) or Ore (38/unit), as they are higher valued.\n\n### Turn 1 Action\nSince we're Player0, we start by making an offer. Let's offer 3 Sheep for 1 Brick, as Brick is more valuable than Sheep.\n\n`[Offer:3 Sheep -> 1 Brick]`\n\nLet's wait for the response from the opponent and proceed accordingly.",

      "response": "To make a new trade offer, let's first analyze the current state and the previous trade offer.\n\nThe current resources and their values are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 15   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 11   Value: 12\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 18   Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 14   Value: 25\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 22   Value: 38\n\nThe previous offer made by Player 0 was: '[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick]'. This offer was rejected by Player 1.\n\nLet's analyze the offer: \n- The offered resources were 3 Sheep, valued at 3 * 17 = 51.\n- The requested resource was 1 Brick, valued at 25.\n\nSince the value of the offered resources (51) is greater than the value of the requested resource (25), the offer is not favorable in terms of increasing the total value of resources. However, it was a starting point.\n\nTo make a more favorable trade, we should look to either offer fewer resources or request more valuable resources.\n\nLet's consider an alternative:\n- We could offer 2 Sheep (2 * 17 = 34) and request 1 Brick (25), but this is still not very favorable.\n- A potentially more favorable trade could involve offering resources of lower value and requesting resources of higher value. For instance, offering some Wheat or Wood for a more valuable resource.\n\nLet's examine the quantities and values again:\n- Offering some Wheat (value: 5) or Wood (value: 12) for a more valuable resource like Brick (value: 25), Sheep (value: 17), or Ore (value: 38) could be a good strategy.\n\nConsidering we have a surplus of Wheat relative to its value, and we want to increase our total value, a potential trade could be:\n- '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood]' is not very appealing since Wood's value is more than double Wheat's value, so we'd be better off not making this trade.\n- '[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]' could be a potential trade. We're offering 2 Wheat (2 * 5 = 10) for 1 Sheep (17), which could be considered.\n\nLet's propose a trade:\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]' is a reasonable offer because we're offering 4 Wheat (4 * 5 = 20) for 1 Sheep (17). Although it slightly decreases our total value, it's not a significant loss, and it shows we're willing to negotiate.\n\nHowever, a better strategy might be to directly offer something for Ore or Brick since they are of higher value:\n- '[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' could be an option. Here, we're offering 2 Wood (2 * 12 = 24) and 2 Wheat (2 * 5 = 10), totaling 34, for 1 Ore (38). This trade slightly increases our total value.\n\nLet's make a trade offer:\n'[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nSo, my action is: [Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore].",

      "response": "To make a decision, let's first assess the current state of resources and the previous transactions.\n\nInitially, the resources and their values were:\n- Wheat: 15, Value: 5\n- Wood: 11, Value: 12\n- Sheep: 18, Value: 17\n- Brick: 14, Value: 25\n- Ore: 22, Value: 38\n\nAfter the accepted trade:\n- Player 1 offered: 3 Wheat, 3 Brick -> Requested: 2 Wood, 1 Ore\n- So, Player 0 got: 3 Wheat, 3 Brick and lost: 2 Wood, 1 Ore\n\nLet's calculate the new quantities and total value:\n- Wheat: 15 + 3 = 18\n- Wood: 11 - 2 = 9\n- Sheep: 18 (no change)\n- Brick: 14 + 3 = 17\n- Ore: 22 - 1 = 21\n\nNew total value = (18 * 5) + (9 * 12) + (18 * 17) + (17 * 25) + (21 * 38)\n= 90 + 108 + 306 + 425 + 798\n= 1727\n\nNow, let's analyze the current offer from Player 1:\n- Offered: 5 Wheat, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> Requested: 2 Ore\n\nIf Player 0 accepts, the new quantities will be:\n- Wheat: 18 + 5 = 23\n- Wood: 9 + 1 = 10\n- Sheep: 18 + 1 = 19\n- Brick: 17 (no change)\n- Ore: 21 - 2 = 19\n\nNew total value = (23 * 5) + (10 * 12) + (19 * 17) + (17 * 25) + (19 * 38)\n= 115 + 120 + 323 + 425 + 722\n= 1705\n\nSince 1705 is less than 1727, accepting this offer would decrease the total value of resources.\n\nLet's formulate a counteroffer or a new offer. We need to identify what we can offer and what we can request. \n\nOne strategy is to look for opportunities that increase our total value. We previously tried to get Ore for Wood or Sheep. Let's examine if we can make a reasonable offer.\n\nGiven the last rejected offer was [Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore], let's adjust it slightly.\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore] could be a reasonable counteroffer as it is related to the last rejected offer and involves Sheep which we have in abundance.\n\nThe action for this turn will be:\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
