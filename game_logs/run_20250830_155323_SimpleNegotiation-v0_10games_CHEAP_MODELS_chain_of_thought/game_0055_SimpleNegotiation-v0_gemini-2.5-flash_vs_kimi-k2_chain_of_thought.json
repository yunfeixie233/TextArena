Net +17, yet I declined.  \n   (Only explanations: either the log text is incomplete or I softmax-explored into a sub-optimal reject.)\n\n2. I pass on making an offer.\n\n3. P0 offers 2 Wood \u2192 1 Ore. Value: 39 vs 16. Net +23. Again I decline (again probably softmax noise).\n\n4. Still silent.\n\n5. I counter with 1 Ore \u2192 5 Wood. 5\u00d78 = 40 vs 39; tiny gain +1 for me, but clearly above equilibrium: P0 needs Wood a lot and isn\u2019t willing to give 5 for 1 \u2192 P0 denies.\n\n6. P0 now pushes the marginal wood price up to 3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore (3\u00d78=24 vs 39; gain +15 for me).\n\nMy current thought process\n- P0 desperately wants Ore and has Wood/Wheat.  \n- My Ore is scarce and high-priced. The marginal utility of 5 more Wood to me is 40; so 3-for-1 is still better for P0 than 5-for-1, ergo almost guaranteed to be their best ceiling today.  \n- Accepting 3 Wood for 1 Ore yields a pure +15 gain and still leaves me with 8 Ore (523), Wood rises to 14 (112), total \u22481 445, net +15.  \n- Because we have only a few turns left (now turn ~8?), any further concession from P0 is unlikely and unnecessary risk.\n\nTherefore the dominant and value-improving move is to take the 3 Wood\u2192Ore deal now.  \n[Accept]",
