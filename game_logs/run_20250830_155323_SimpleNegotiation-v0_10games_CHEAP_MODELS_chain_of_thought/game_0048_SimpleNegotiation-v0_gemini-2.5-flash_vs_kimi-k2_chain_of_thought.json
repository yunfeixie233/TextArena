I want to trade up.\nPerhaps they need Wheat for something else, or have an abundance of Brick.\n\nLet's try to get rid of more Wheat, and possibly some Wood, for higher-value items.\nI have a lot of Ore and Wood. I could try to trade some of those for Brick or Sheep, as I have fewer of those.\nI have 9 Brick, which is a good amount, but more would be good if the trade is favorable.\nSheep is also good for its value and quantity.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Since Player 1 rejected my low-value offer for Brick, I will offer something more attractive.\nI have plenty of Wood, and it's not the most valuable item. Maybe 2 Wood for 1 Sheep?\n2 Wood (2 * 12 = 24) for 1 Sheep (13) is a bad trade for me.\n\nThe last trade was 5 Wheat (25 value) for 1 Brick (27 value). This was a fair trade for me if they accepted.\nSince they denied it, they likely want more value for their Brick, or less value for their Wheat.\n\nLet's try to acquire even more valuable items like Ore or Brick, or increase my Sheep count, which is moderate.\nI have 18 Wheat. This is the least valuable. I should try to offload it.\nWhat if I offer a larger quantity of Wheat for something else?\nWhat about 10 Wheat for 1 Ore? (10 * 5 = 50 vs 33). That's a bad trade for me.\n\nHow about I try to get some Sheep or Brick by offering Wood?\nI have 23 Wood (Value 12).\nI offered 5 Wheat for 1 Brick, which they rejected.\n\nI will try to trade some of my higher quantity, lower-mid-value items for a more scarce, higher-value item.\nI have 23 Wood. I have 14 Sheep.
