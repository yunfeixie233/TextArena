      "response": "Let me quickly appraise the situation.\n\nCurrent portfolio value\n- Wheat: 18 \u00d7 6 = 108  \n- Wood: 9 \u00d7 11 = 99  \n- Sheep: 13 \u00d7 12 = 156  \n- Brick: 22 \u00d7 22 = 484  \n- Ore: 13 \u00d7 40 = 520  \nTotal asset value = 1 167\n\nKey observations  \n\n1. Ore is the highest-per-unit-value good (40).  \n2. My Brick stock is ample (22) and I could spare 4 without dipping below a workable stack.  \n3. Player 1 keeps trying to swap 1 Ore for big bundles; I need to give them a deal that still looks juicy while netting me value on paper.  \n4. Wheat is my least valuable good and I can dump plenty of it if Player 1 actually wants it.\n\nProposed deal (I net +11 value)  \n- I give away 4 Brick + 4 Wheat (4 \u00d7 22 + 4 \u00d7 6 = 88 + 24 = 112 value)  \n- I receive 1 Ore + 1 Wood (1 \u00d7 40 + 1 \u00d7 11 = 51 value)\n\nThe five-for-five trade keeps the counts even, which often looks \u201cfair\u201d in the UI, while I quietly upgrade low-value Wheat & over-stocked Brick into precious Ore.\n\n[Offer: 4 Brick, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Wood]",
