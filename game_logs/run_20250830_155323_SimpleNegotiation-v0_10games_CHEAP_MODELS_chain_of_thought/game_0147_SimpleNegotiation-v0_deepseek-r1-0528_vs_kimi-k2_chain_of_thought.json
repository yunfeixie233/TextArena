You're offering 4 Wheat and 1 Sheep (total value: 4\u00d75 + 1\u00d714 = 34) in exchange for 2 Ore (total value: 2\u00d740 = 80). This trade would decrease my total resource value by 46, which directly contradicts my goal of increasing total worth. The imbalance in value cannot be justified, especially given the high importance of Ore in my resource strategy.\n\nI've noticed a pattern where previous offers from both sides involving Ore or uneven Wheat-based trades have been rejected, highlighting a valuation gap. To move forward constructively, I plan to propose a new offer next turn if the game continues\u2014specifically focusing on exchanging Sheep for Brick, where there may be mutual value potential given my surplus and Brick's higher per-unit worth.\n\nFor now, I formally:  \n[Deny]",
