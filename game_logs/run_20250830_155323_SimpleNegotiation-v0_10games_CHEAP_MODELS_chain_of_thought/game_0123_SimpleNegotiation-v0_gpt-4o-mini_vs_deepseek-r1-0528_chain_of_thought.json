Trading away high-value resources for lower-value ones decreases my total asset worth. \n\nInstead, I propose a mutually beneficial exchange focused on resources we each may value differently. I'm offering Sheep (moderate value) and Wood (lower value) in return for Ore, which I prioritize. \n\n**Trade proposal**: [Offer: 5 Sheep, 5 Wood -> 3 Ore]  \n\nThis allows me to consolidate higher-value Ore while providing you with versatile resources.
