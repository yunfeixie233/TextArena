I will try to trade away resources that are less valuable to me (like Wheat and Wood) for more valuable ones (like Ore and Brick), or trade a large quantity of one resource for a smaller quantity of a higher-value resource, if the value increases. I have a good amount of Sheep, but they aren't my highest value resource, so I might be willing to trade some.\n\nLet me try to trade some Wheat and Wood for something more valuable. Or perhaps even a large amount of Sheep for some Ore or Brick.\n\nI'll start with an offer that tries to get rid of some lower-value items while gaining higher value ones.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
