      "response": "### Negotiation Game - Initial Analysis\n\nAs Player 0, my goal is to increase the total value of my resources through trades with my opponent over 10 turns.\n\n#### Initial Resources and Values:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 20   Value: 5\n- [Wood]    Qty: 7    Value: 10\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 5    Value: 15\n- [Brick]   Qty: 15   Value: 22\n- [Ore]     Qty: 8    Value: 37\n\n#### Initial Total Value Calculation:\n1. Wheat: 20 * 5 = 100\n2. Wood: 7 * 10 = 70\n3. Sheep: 5 * 15 = 75\n4. Brick: 15 * 22 = 330\n5. Ore: 8 * 37 = 296\n\nTotal Value = 100 + 70 + 75 + 330 + 296 = 871\n\n#### Strategy:\nTo maximize the total value, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but more quantity if it sets up a future beneficial trade.\n\n#### Initial Offer Consideration:\nGiven the initial values, Ore is the most valuable resource per unit, followed by Brick. I have a considerable amount of Brick and a decent amount of Ore. \n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. I have 8 Ore, which is highly valued. Trading away some of my less valuable resources for more Ore or keeping Ore and getting other valuable resources could be beneficial.\n2. I have a substantial quantity of Brick (15 units), which is also valuable.\n\nA potential initial offer could involve trading some of my less valuable resources (Wheat, Wood, or Sheep) for more Ore or other valuable resources.\n\n#### First Turn Action:\nSince I have a relatively balanced portfolio but wish to maximize my total value, I'll start by making an offer that attempts to get more of the higher-value resources or maintain my current valuable resources while shedding less valuable ones.\n\nConsidering the values, let's propose a trade that involves giving away some Wheat (the least valuable resource per unit) and potentially other less valuable resources for something more valuable or equally valuable but in a different category.\n\nLet's make an offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\n### Action for Turn 1:\n`[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`",

We need to identify resources that we can offer which are less valuable to us and resources that we can request which are more valuable.\n\nGiven the current values and quantities:\n- We have a relatively high quantity of Brick (Value: 22) and a decent amount of Ore (Value: 37), which is the most valuable resource per unit.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some of our less valuable resources or excess resources for something more valuable or equally valuable.\n\nLet's consider making an offer:\n- We could offer some Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 10) for a more valuable resource.\n\nA possible trade could be offering 4 Wood (Value: 10*4 = 40) for 1 Sheep (Value: 15*1 = 15) or other combinations.

      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the current state of resources\nThe current resources and their values are: Wheat (Qty: 14, Value: 5), Wood (Qty: 7, Value: 10), Sheep (Qty: 5, Value: 15), Brick (Qty: 11, Value: 22), Ore (Qty: 10, Value: 37).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total value of current resources\nTotal value = (14 * 5) + (7 * 10) + (5 * 15) + (11 * 22) + (10 * 37) = 70 + 70 + 75 + 242 + 370 = 827.\n\n## Step 3: Review the history of trades and offers\nThe history shows that Player 0 initially offered 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, which was rejected. Then, Player 1 offered 6 Wheat for 1 Ore, which was accepted. Later, Player 0 offered 4 Brick for 2 Ore, which was accepted. The last offer from Player 0 was 7 Wheat for 1 Ore, which was rejected.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the current situation and decide on the next step\nGiven that the last offer (7 Wheat for 1 Ore) was rejected, and considering the current resources, we need to decide whether to make a new offer or not. Currently, we have 14 Wheat, 7 Wood, 5 Sheep, 11 Brick, and 10 Ore.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate potential trades based on resource values\nTo increase the total value, we should look for trades that give us more value than we give away. Our resources are valued as follows: Wheat (5), Wood (10), Sheep (15), Brick (22), Ore (37). A good trade would involve giving away lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n## Step 6: Consider possible trade offers\nOne potential trade could involve offering resources like Wheat or Brick for Ore, since Ore is highly valued. However, we've already done some trades involving Wheat and Ore, and Brick and Ore.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate a new trade offer\nLet's consider offering some Wheat or Brick for Ore again or look for other combinations. We could offer Wood or Sheep for higher-value resources. For example, offering Sheep (Value: 15) for Ore (Value: 37) could be a good trade.\n\n## Step 8: Propose a specific trade\nOffering 2 Sheep (2 * 15 = 30) for 1 Ore (37) is a potential trade because 37 > 30, it's a gain.\n\n## Step 9: Check if the proposed trade is feasible with the current resources\nWe have 5 Sheep, so offering 2 Sheep is feasible.\n\n## Step 10: Formulate the trade offer in the required format\nThe offer would be: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore].\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the new total value if the trade is accepted\nIf we get 1 Ore for 2 Sheep, we lose 2 * 15 = 30 and gain 37. Net gain = 37 - 30 = 7. New total value = 827 + 7 = 834.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]}$",
