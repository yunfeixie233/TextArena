Rejecting is rational.\n\n### Strategy Adjustment for Turn 2\n\n1. Don\u2019t offer packages unless trade is strictly **value-positive for me** (ideally >15 in my favor), yet still **value-positive (or at least neutral) for P1**.\n2. Ore (36) and Brick (20) are my highest/second-highest value per unit\u2014I should hoard rather than trade them away unless the return is huge.\n3. Wheat (5) and Wood (9) are my lowest values per unit\u2014safe to offer.\n4. Sheep (18) is mid-range but plentiful in my hand; still, only offer modest amounts.\n\n### Targeted Trade Idea\n- **Offer Wheat + Wood only** to avoid giving up high-value items.\n- Example that helps me:\n  - I\u2019m long Wheat (23) and mid Wood (17). I could trade Wheat for more Wood if that improves the mix.\n  - 6 Wheat \u2192 3 Ore / 2 Brick would be great for me, but may not interest P1.\n  - Simpler start: offer surplus Wheat.\n\n### Turn 2 Offer\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",
