      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, I will analyze my current resources and their values:\n\n- Wheat: Qty = 16, Value = 6\n- Wood: Qty = 10, Value = 12\n- Sheep: Qty = 20, Value = 12\n- Brick: Qty = 5, Value = 21\n- Ore: Qty = 5, Value = 38\n\nThe total value of my current resources is calculated as follows:\n- Total Value = (16 * 6) + (10 * 12) + (20 * 12) + (5 * 21) + (5 * 38)\n- Total Value = 96 + 120 + 240 + 105 + 190 = 751\n\n### Negotiation Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I need to negotiate trades that give me resources of higher value in exchange for resources of lower value. The values per unit are: Wheat (6), Wood (12), Sheep (12), Brick (21), Ore (38). Thus, the order of preference for acquiring new resources should be: Ore > Brick > Sheep/Wood > Wheat.\n\n### Initial Trade Offer\n\nGiven my current resources and their values, I have a surplus of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep compared to Brick and Ore. I should look to trade some of my lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\nLet's start by examining potential trades. I can offer some of my Wheat (Value = 6) or Sheep/Wood (Value = 12) for Brick (Value = 21) or Ore (Value = 38).\n\nFor my first offer, I'll propose trading some of my less valuable resources for Brick, as it's more valuable than Wood and Sheep but less valuable than Ore, making it a more accessible initial target.\n\n### Trade Offer\n\nI have 16 Wheat and 20 Sheep. Let's offer 4 Wheat and 2 Sheep for 2 Brick.\n\n- Offered Resources: 4 Wheat (Value = 4*6 = 24), 2 Sheep (Value = 2*12 = 24), Total Offered Value = 48\n- Requested Resources: 2 Brick (Value = 2*21 = 42)\n\nThe total value of the offered resources is slightly higher than the requested resources. This is somewhat balanced, but I am willing to make this trade to get more Brick.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick]`\n\nLet's see the response from Player 1.",

We could offer to accept a modified version of their offer or make a new offer.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate a Response or Counteroffer\nSince we can't fulfill the Wheat request, a possible response could be to deny their offer and make a new offer that benefits both parties.\n\n## Step 4: Decide on the Action\nDenying the offer is straightforward: '[Deny]'.\n\nLet's consider making a new offer. We need to think about what we can offer that might be valuable to Player 1 and what we want in return.\n\n## Step 5: Propose a New Offer\nConsidering our remaining resources and the value of items, a potential new offer could involve trading some of our less valuable resources for something more valuable.\n\nOne potential offer: \n- We have plenty of Sheep (17 left) and some Wheat (2 left), but Wheat is not much. \n- Offering some Sheep for Ore could be a good strategy since Ore is very valuable.\n\nLet's propose: '[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThe final action for this turn is: '[Deny]' followed by a new offer: '[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThe response is: '[Deny][Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'.",

Player 1 offered 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n\nLet's evaluate the last offer made by Player 1: \n- Offered: 1 Sheep (Value: 12), 3 Wheat (Value: 3*6 = 18), Total Value = 30\n- Requested: 1 Ore (Value: 38)\n- For Player 0: Giving up 1 Ore (Value: 38) for 1 Sheep and 3 Wheat (Total Value: 30) is not beneficial as it results in a loss of 8.\n\nHowever, acquiring Sheep and Wheat for Ore could be a strategic move if it sets up for a future beneficial trade or if the values of the resources change. Let's directly assess the current offer:\n- Current Ore: 5, Value: 38 each = 190\n- If accepted, Ore: 4, Value: 152, and gain 1 Sheep (Value: 12) and 3 Wheat (Value: 18), Total new Value = 152 + 12 + 18 = 182\n\nThe direct value calculation indicates a loss, but let's review our resources and the potential future value.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer that could be more beneficial.\n\n## Step 1: Evaluate the Current Resources and Values\nWe have Wheat: 16 - 4 - 6 - 4 = 2, Wood: 10, Sheep: 20 - 2 - 1 - 2 + 0 = 15 (after all previous offers), Brick: 5, Ore: 5.\n\n## Step 2: Adjust Quantities Based on Previous Offers\nAfter the previous offers, the quantities are:\n- Wheat: 16 - 4 - 6 - 4 = 2\n- Sheep: 20 - 2 - 1 - 2 = 15\n- Ore: 5 (since none were given away)\n\n## Step 3: Assessing the Last Offer from Player 1\nThe offer is 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat for 1 Ore. We currently have 2 Wheat, so we can't fulfill the request for 3 Wheat. Thus, we need to consider our current quantities and potential trades.\n\n## Step 4: Consider a Counteroffer\nSince we can't accept the offer due to insufficient Wheat, let's think about what we can offer. We need to increase our total value.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate a Counteroffer\nLet's directly propose a trade that could be beneficial. Since Player 1 is requesting Ore and we have it, let's see what we can get in return.\n\n## Step 6: Decision\nConsidering the current state and the fact that we need to increase our total value, let's directly propose a counteroffer.\n\nGiven that we have:\n- Wheat: 2\n- Wood: 10\n- Sheep: 15\n- Brick: 5\n- Ore: 5\n\nWe can offer something that might be valuable to Player 1 and beneficial for us.\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- We can offer 1 Ore (since it's valuable and Player 1 is requesting it) and see what we can get.\n\nThe action for this turn is: \n'[Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Wood]' is a potential counteroffer because it requests something we currently have a decent quantity of (though not extremely high value, it's still a resource) and is not too costly. However, let's directly check if this is a viable format and makes sense.\n\nThe best answer is [Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Wood].",

      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first assess the current state of resources and the history of trades.\n\nInitial Resources:\n- Wheat: 16 (Value: 6) = 96\n- Wood: 10 (Value: 12) = 120\n- Sheep: 20 (Value: 12) = 240\n- Brick: 5 (Value: 21) = 105\n- Ore: 5 (Value: 38) = 190\n\nTotal Initial Value = 96 + 120 + 240 + 105 + 190 = 751\n\nCurrent Resources after previous trades (since no trades were accepted):\n- Wheat: 16 - 4 - 6 - 4 - 0 (offered) + 0 (received) = 2\n- Wood: 10 + 0 (received) - 0 (offered) = 10\n- Sheep: 20 - 2 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 0 (offered) + 3 (received in last considered offer but not accepted) = 18 (but for calculation simplicity and adhering to what's actually happened: 20 - 2 - 1 - 2 = 15)\n- Brick: 5 + 2 (requested but not received) = 5\n- Ore: 5 - 0 (offered) + 0 (received) - 1 (offered) - 1 (offered) - 1 (offered) = 2 (since we offered 1 Ore multiple times but it was not accepted)\n\nLet's simplify to the actual current state after the offers made and not considering the last offers that were not accepted:\n- Wheat: 2\n- Wood: 10\n- Sheep: 15 (correcting my step to reflect actual transactions, it should be: 20 - 2 - 1 - 2 = 15)\n- Brick: 5\n- Ore: 2\n\nCurrent Value:\n- Wheat: 2 * 6 = 12\n- Wood: 10 * 12 = 120\n- Sheep: 15 * 12 = 180\n- Brick: 5 * 21 = 105\n- Ore: 2 * 38 = 76\n\nTotal Current Value = 12 + 120 + 180 + 105 + 76 = 493\n\nLet's analyze the last offers:\n1. Player 0's last offer: '[Offer: 1 Ore -> 4 Wood]'\n   - You had 2 Ore and would be left with 1 Ore.\n   - You had 10 Wood and would have 14 Wood.\n   - Value change: -1*38 (Ore) + 4*12 (Wood) = -38 + 48 = +10\n\n2. Player 1's last offer: '[Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'\n   - You had 15 Sheep and would have 16 Sheep (after receiving 1 Sheep).\n   - You had 2 Wheat and would have 4 Wheat.\n   - You had 2 Ore and would have 1 Ore.\n   - Value change: +1*12 (Sheep) + 2*6 (Wheat) - 1*38 (Ore) = +12 + 12 - 38 = -14\n\nGiven that it's the last turn and we need to make a decision:\n- For Player 1's last offer, accepting it results in a negative value change (-14), which is not beneficial.\n\nLet's directly analyze and make a trade:\nConsidering we have very low Wheat and Ore, and relatively more Sheep, we need to optimize.\n\nSince Player 1's last offer was not beneficial and we've used up our turns mostly, let's directly look at making a counteroffer or finalizing.\n\nTo keep it simple and make a logical guess, our resources are somewhat depleted in certain areas. We can attempt to gain more value.\n\nAn example offer could involve trading something we have more of for something valuable.\n\nLet's consider making an offer that involves Sheep or Wood since we have a good amount of them.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore] could be a potential offer, as it gives us 1 Ore (Value: 38) in exchange for 3 Sheep (Value: 3*12 = 36). It's almost a fair trade and might be appealing.\n\n'[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' \n\nLet's calculate:\n- You have 15 Sheep and will have 12 Sheep.\n- You have 2 Ore and will have 3 Ore.\n- Value change: -3*12 (Sheep) + 1*38 (Ore) = -36 + 38 = +2\n\nSo, making this offer: \n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
