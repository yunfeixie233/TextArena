      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, I will analyze my current resources and their values to devise a strategy to increase the total value of my resources.\n\n- Current Resources and Values:\n  - Wheat: 15 units, Value: 5\n  - Wood: 10 units, Value: 10\n  - Sheep: 21 units, Value: 18\n  - Brick: 12 units, Value: 29\n  - Ore: 6 units, Value: 37\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n1. **Total Current Value**: To understand my starting position, I calculate the total value of my resources.\n   - Total Value = (15*5) + (10*10) + (21*18) + (12*29) + (6*37)\n   - Total Value = 75 + 100 + 378 + 348 + 222 = 1123\n\n2. **Resource Valuation**: I have a mix of resources with Ore being the most valuable per unit and Wheat being the least. My resources with higher values are Ore, Brick, and Sheep.\n\n3. **Trade Strategy**: To increase the total value, I should aim to trade resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable. Given my current resources, trading Wheat and/or Wood for more valuable resources could be beneficial.\n\n### Potential Trades\n\nTo start, I'll consider making an offer that involves trading some of my less valuable resources for more valuable ones. \n\n1. **Potential Offer**: I could offer Wheat or Wood in exchange for Ore or Brick, as these are more valuable.\n\n### First Turn Action\n\nFor my first turn, I'll make an offer to trade some of my less valuable resources for more valuable ones. I'll propose:\n- '[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore, 2 Brick]'\n\nThis offer gives away:\n- 5 Wheat = 5*5 = 25 value\n- 3 Wood = 3*10 = 30 value\n- Total given = 25 + 30 = 55 value\n\nIn return, I receive:\n- 1 Ore = 1*37 = 37 value\n- 2 Brick = 2*29 = 58 value\n- Total received = 37 + 58 = 95 value\n\nThe net gain in value = 95 - 55 = 40\n\nMy action for Turn 1: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore, 2 Brick]`",

      "response": "Since Player 1 rejected my initial offer and made no counteroffer, I need to reassess the situation and potentially make a new offer.\n\nLet's analyze my current resources and the initial offer:\n- Current Resources:\n  - Wheat: 15\n  - Wood: 10\n  - Sheep: 21\n  - Brick: 12\n  - Ore: 6\n\nInitial Offer was: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore, 2 Brick\n\nAfter the rejection, my resources remain:\n  - Wheat: 15 (since the offer wasn't accepted)\n  - Wood: 10\n  - Sheep: 21\n  - Brick: 12\n  - Ore: 6\n\nLet's think about a new offer. I need to increase my total resource value. My resources and their total values are:\n  - 15 Wheat = 15 * 5 = 75\n  - 10 Wood = 10 * 10 = 100\n  - 21 Sheep = 21 * 18 = 378\n  - 12 Brick = 12 * 29 = 348\n  - 6 Ore = 6 * 37 = 222\n\nTotal value = 75 + 100 + 378 + 348 + 222 = 1123\n\nTo increase my total value, I should try to get more of the higher-value resources or maintain what I have if possible. Since Ore has the highest value per item (37), and I have a relatively low quantity of it, I might want to try to get more Ore.\n\nConsidering my previous offer was rejected, I should think about what I can offer differently. I previously offered 5 Wheat and 3 Wood for 1 Ore and 2 Brick. Let's think about adjusting this.\n\nLet's offer something that might be more appealing, keeping in mind that I'm trying to get more Ore. Perhaps I can offer more of a lower-value resource for Ore.\n\nOne possible offer could be: \n- Offering more Sheep (since I have a lot) or Brick (since I have a decent amount and it's valuable) in exchange for Ore.\n\nFor instance, offering 2 Brick for 1 Ore might be more appealing to Player 1 since it involves giving away 2 Brick (2*29 = 58) for 1 Ore (1*37 = 37), which doesn't seem like a good deal for me. However, giving away some Sheep could work.\n\nLet's consider: [Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis means giving away 4 Sheep (4*18 = 72) for 1 Ore (1*37 = 37), which still doesn't seem like a good deal for me as I'm losing value.\n\nHowever, adjusting my initial thought, if I were to make a more balanced offer, I could think about giving away resources that are less valuable to me in exchange for Ore.\n\nLet's directly propose a trade that involves giving away some of my resources for Ore. \n\nSince my previous offer was denied, I'll think about something different. \n\nLet's examine an alternative:\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nHere, I'm giving away 2 Wood (2*10 = 20) and 3 Sheep (3*18 = 54), totaling 74, for 1 Ore (1*37 = 37). This still doesn't seem like a good trade for me as I'm losing value.\n\nRevisiting my resources and thinking about what would be a good trade, let's directly check the values and see if there's an alternative.\n\nMy next offer: \n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]\n\nHere, I'm offering 8 Wheat (8*5 = 40) and 2 Wood (2*10 = 20), totaling 60, for 2 Ore (2*37 = 74). This seems like a potentially good trade as I'm gaining value (74 > 60).\n\nSo, my action is:\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Ore]",

Player 1 rejected it.\n   - You then offered 4 Sheep for 1 Ore. Player 1 rejected it.\n   - Player 1 offered 4 Sheep for 1 Ore.\n\nLet's evaluate the offers:\n\n1. **Your First Offer (5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore, 2 Brick):**\n   - Offered: 5 Wheat (5*5 = 25) + 3 Wood (3*10 = 30) = 55\n   - Requested: 1 Ore (1*37 = 37) + 2 Brick (2*29 = 58) = 95\n   - The request was worth more than the offer, which is a good trade for you, but Player 1 rejected it.\n\n2. **Your Second Offer (4 Sheep -> 1 Ore):**\n   - Offered: 4 Sheep (4*18 = 72)\n   - Requested: 1 Ore (1*37 = 37)\n   - This was not a favorable trade for you since you were offering more value than you were receiving.\n\n3. **Player 1's Offer (4 Sheep -> 1 Ore):**\n   - This is the same as your second offer but in the opposite direction. Since it's the same ratio, it's still not favorable for you to accept because you're getting less value than you're giving.\n\nGiven the situation, let's think about the next step:\n\n- **Your Goal:** Increase the total value of your resources.\n- **Current State:** Player 1's offer is not beneficial for you as it stands.\n\nLet's analyze what you can do:\n\n1. **Accepting Player 1's Offer:** Not beneficial as it reduces your total value.\n   \n2. **Making a New Offer:** You could think of making a new offer that is more balanced or beneficial for both parties.\n\nLet's consider an alternative offer:\n\nYou have a surplus of Sheep and lack Ore. A reasonable trade could involve Ore.
