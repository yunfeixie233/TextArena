      "response": "Here\u2019s the plan I\u2019ll follow:\n\n1. Calculate my current total value  \n   Wheat: 14 \u00d7 5  =  70  \n   Wood: 19 \u00d7 8   = 152  \n   Sheep: 23 \u00d7 12 = 276  \n   Brick: 13 \u00d7 29 = 377  \n   Ore:   23 \u00d7 35 = 805  \n   TOTAL VALUE = 70 + 152 + 276 + 377 + 805 = 1 680  \n\n2. Find the single most under-valued item I own and the most over-valued item my opponent is likely to have (from a quick scan of the public rules):  \n   \u2022 My Brick (29 per unit) and Ore (35 per unit) are two of my highest-valued items.  \n   \u2022 Wheat (5) and Wood (8) are by far my lowest.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, every extra Brick or Ore I gain and every Wheat or Wood I give away ups my value quickly.\n\n3. Because there are six hidden resources per player, I\u2019ll conservatively assume they value any resource at least its list price (no forced mis-valuation). My minimum value target for any deal is a 1-for-1 value gain. In practice, I greedily require at least a 2-for-1 value gain when bidding unless I\u2019m making change (trying to hit an exact tile).\n\n4. Primary target: convert Wheat and Wood upward into Brick or Ore, even at modest ratios.\n\n\u2014\u2014  Turn 1  \u2014\u2014  \nI\u2019ll probe the table with a reasonable opener.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Brick]",
