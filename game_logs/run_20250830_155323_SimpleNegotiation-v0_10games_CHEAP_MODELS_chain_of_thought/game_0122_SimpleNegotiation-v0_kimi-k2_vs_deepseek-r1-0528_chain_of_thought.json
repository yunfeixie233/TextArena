      "response": "Let me analyze the evolving situation and then decide what to do.\n\nCurrent resources for Player 0 (me)\n- Wheat: 16 + 7 \u2013 7 = 16 (start 16 \u2192 gain 7 \u2192 lose 2\u00d77 = 14 \u2192 net 16 + 7 \u2013 14 = 9 \u2026 but in the history I never actually lose 7 Wheat, I only gain 7 and 3 Wood when I accept 2 Ore, so the Wheat count I have right now must be 16 + 7 = 23 and I still have the original 8 Wood + the +3 Wood from acceptance \u2192 11 Wood; 16 \u2013 8 = 8 Wood used in offers; but that\u2019s not right because I only accepted once)\n\nLet\u2019s reconcile the messages accurately:\n1. At start:\n   Wheat 16   Value 6\n   Wood  8    Value 12\n   Sheep 14   Value 14\n   Brick 7    Value 20\n   Ore   12   Value 35   \u2014> Total value = 96 + 96 + 196 + 140 + 420 = 948\n\n2. I accepted one trade: Player 1 gave 7 Wheat & 3 Wood, I gave 2 Ore.\n   After acceptance:\n   Wheat: 16 + 7 = 23\n   Wood:  8  + 3 = 11\n   Sheep: 14\n   Brick: 7\n   Ore:   12 \u2013 2 = 10\n   New total value = 23\u00d76 + 11\u00d712 + 14\u00d714 + 7\u00d720 + 10\u00d735 = 138 + 132 + 196 + 140 + 350 = 956\n   Net gain so far: +8.\n\nNow Player 1 is again offering 8 Wheat + 2 Wood for 2 Ore.  \nRelative to the trade I already accepted (7 Wheat +3 Wood for 2 Ore) this is slightly less attractive because it adds only 1 extra Wheat instead of 1 extra Wood.  \nMoreover, Ore is my single most valuable resource (35 each) and I only have 10 left. I don\u2019t want to let it go if I can\u2019t get an even better return. Therefore I will reject the current offer.\n\nInstead, I will make my own offer that improves my Brick position, because after the Ore trade I still need more Brick (one of the highest-value resources and I only have 7).  \nI\u2019ll offer a modest but potentially acceptable ratio: 4 Wheat (value 24) for 2 Brick (value 40). This gives me a value gain of 16 and still leaves me with plenty of Wheat.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",
