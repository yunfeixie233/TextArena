      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, let's start by analyzing the current state of our resources and their values:\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Quantity = 5, Value = 5\n- **[Wood]**: Quantity = 24, Value = 11\n- **[Sheep]**: Quantity = 20, Value = 16\n- **[Brick]**: Quantity = 9, Value = 28\n- **[Ore]**: Quantity = 5, Value = 34\n\nThe total value of our current resources is calculated as follows:\n- Total Value = (5 * 5) + (24 * 11) + (20 * 16) + (9 * 28) + (5 * 34)\n- Total Value = 25 + 264 + 320 + 252 + 170\n- Total Value = 1031\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n\nTo increase the total value of our resources, we need to consider what resources are valuable and how we can acquire more value through trades. The resources with the highest individual values are **[Ore]** (Value = 34) and **[Brick]** (Value = 28).\n\n### Trade Offer Strategy\n\n1. **Identify Potential Trades**: We should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value if possible.\n2. **Analyze Resource Quantities**: We have a substantial quantity of **[Wood]** and **[Sheep]**, moderate quantities of **[Brick]**, and relatively low quantities of **[Wheat]** and **[Ore]**.\n\n### Initial Trade Offer\n\nLet's consider making an initial trade offer that could potentially increase our total value. Since **[Ore]** is our most valuable resource per unit and we have a relatively low quantity of it, we might want to avoid trading it away. However, we can look to trade some of our less valuable resources for more **[Ore]** or **[Brick]** if the opportunity arises.\n\nGiven our current quantities and values, a potential strategy is to offer some of our abundant resources in exchange for **[Ore]** or **[Brick]**. For instance, we could consider offering some **[Wood]** or **[Sheep]** for **[Ore]**.\n\n### Example Trade Offer\n\nLet's propose a trade that could be beneficial:\n- **[Offer: 8 Wood -> 2 Ore]**\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 8 Wood -> 2 Ore]`\n\nThe reasoning behind this offer is that we are giving up 8 units of **[Wood]** (total value = 8 * 11 = 88) in exchange for 2 units of **[Ore]** (total value = 2 * 34 = 68). While this specific trade doesn't immediately seem beneficial due to the lower value received compared to what's given, it's not a good example. Let's adjust our strategy.\n\n### Revised Trade Offer\n\nLet's think about a more balanced or beneficial trade:\n- We could offer some **[Sheep]** for **[Brick]** since both are relatively valuable, but **[Brick]** is more valuable per unit.\n\nExample: `[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick]`\n\nHere, we're offering 4 **[Sheep]** (total value = 4 * 16 = 64) for 2 **[Brick]** (total value = 2 * 28 = 56). This trade isn't favorable as it stands because we're giving up more value than we're gaining.\n\n### Better Trade Strategy\n\nLet's directly formulate a reasonable offer:\n- `[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick]`\n\nThis means offering 5 **[Wood]** (value = 5 * 11 = 55) and 2 **[Sheep]** (value = 2 * 16 = 32), totaling 87 in value, for 3 **[Brick]** (value = 3 * 28 = 84). This is still not ideal as we're slightly losing value.\n\n### Initial Action\n\nLet's start with a more nuanced offer that aims to be more balanced or potentially beneficial, taking into consideration the values and quantities:\n- `[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]`\n\nThis offer involves giving up 3 **[Sheep]** (3 * 16 = 48) and 1 **[Wheat]** (1 * 5 = 5), totaling 53 in value, for 2 **[Brick]** (2 * 28 = 56), which is a slight gain.\n\nLet's make this our initial offer.\n\n### Action\n\n`[Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]`",

Initially, 24 Wood = 11. So, the value per Wood = 11 / 24. For 16 Wood, the value = (11 / 24) * 16 = 7.33.

      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the game's progress, here's the current state:\n\n1. **Initial Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 5, Value: 5\n   - Wood: 24, Value: 11\n   - Sheep: 20, Value: 16\n   - Brick: 9, Value: 28\n   - Ore: 5, Value: 34\n\n2. **Changes Due to Trades:**\n   - Offered 8 Wood for 2 Ore: \n     - Wood: 24 - 8 = 16\n     - Ore: 5 + 2 = 7\n   - Offered 4 Sheep for 1 Ore:\n     - Sheep: 20 - 4 = 16\n     - Ore: 7 + 1 = 8\n   - Offered 5 Wheat for 1 Ore:\n     - Wheat: 5 - 5 = 0\n     - Ore: 8 + 1 = 9\n\n3. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 0\n   - Wood: 16\n   - Sheep: 16\n   - Brick: 9\n   - Ore: 9\n\n4. **Current Total Value:**\n   - Wheat: 0 * 5 = 0\n   - Wood: 16 * 11 = 176\n   - Sheep: 16 * 16 = 256\n   - Brick: 9 * 28 = 252\n   - Ore: 9 * 34 = 306\n   - Total Value = 0 + 176 + 256 + 252 + 306 = 990\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\n\nTo maximize the total value, we should look for trades that increase the overall value. Given the current resources and the history of trades, here's a potential strategy:\n\n1. **Identify Valuable Trades:** Since Ore has the highest value per unit, we should try to acquire more if possible. However, we need to have something valuable to offer.\n\n2. **Potential Offers:**\n   - We have a significant amount of Sheep and Brick, but Ore is more valuable. \n   - We could offer some of our less valuable resources (in terms of total value or quantity) for Ore or other high-value resources.\n\n3. **Specific Offer:**\n   - We can consider offering some Sheep or Brick for more Ore or potentially other resources if it seems beneficial.\n\n### Proposed Action for Turn 5\n\nLet's formulate a trade offer. We could offer some Brick (since we have 9 and it's relatively valuable but less than Ore) for Ore.\n\n- Offer: 2 Brick for 1 Ore\n  - This seems reasonable as we are giving up 2 Brick (Value: 2*28 = 56) for 1 Ore (Value: 34). However, this is not a good trade since we're losing value (56 for 34).\n\nLet's consider an alternative:\n- We could offer some Sheep for Ore.\n  - Example: 4 Sheep for 1 Ore\n    - Giving up: 4 Sheep = 4 * 16 = 64\n    - Getting: 1 Ore = 1 * 34 = 34\n  - This is also not favorable.\n\nRevisiting our resources and values:\n- We could offer Wood (less valuable per unit but still a considerable quantity) for Ore or Brick.\n\nLet's propose:\n- Offer: 6 Wood for 1 Ore\n  - Giving up: 6 Wood = 6 * 11 = 66\n  - Getting: 1 Ore = 1 * 34 = 34\n- This is not a good trade.\n\nUpon reevaluation, a more suitable offer might involve directly trying to get a better deal or sticking with what we know has worked (trading for Ore).\n\n### Actual Action\n\nGiven the constraints and upon further consideration, a reasonable trade is not straightforward. Let's directly aim to increase our value.\n\nLet's propose: `[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]` \n- This translates to: Giving up (4*11 + 2*16) = 44 + 32 = 76 for 1 Ore (Value: 34). This is still not a good trade.\n\nLet's directly check the response from the opponent and react accordingly.\n\nSince formulating a good offer is challenging with our current resources and the game's state, let's directly consider the opponent's last action and our previous offers.\n\n### Turn 5 Action\nSince we need to make a new offer or react, let's propose an offer directly.\n\n`[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis means giving up 3 Brick (3*28 = 84) for 1 Ore (34), which is not a good trade. Let's reconsider.\n\nLet's directly evaluate a simpler trade: `[Offer: 8 Sheep -> 2 Ore]`\n- Giving up: 8 Sheep = 8 * 16 = 128\n- Getting: 2 Ore = 2 * 34 = 68\n\nThis is not a good trade.\n\nRevisiting, a potentially more balanced or less detrimental trade is needed.\n\n### Final Decision for Turn 5\n\nLet's go with: `[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThe action in the required format is: `[Offer: 5 Wood,  -> 1 Brick]` \n\nLet's correct this and simplify:\n`[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Brick]`",

This was rejected.\n- The current total value of resources is 990, which is less than the initial total value of 1031.\n\nTo increase the total value, we need to strategically make a new offer. We should aim to acquire resources that are of higher value or at least maintain the current value while potentially gaining more in subsequent trades.\n\nLet's analyze the possible trades:\n1. We can offer resources that are less valuable for more valuable ones.\n2. We have a significant quantity of Wood and Sheep, and a decent amount of Brick and Ore.\n\nA potential trade could involve offering some of the less valuable resources (Wood or Sheep) for more valuable ones (Brick or Ore). However, we already have a good amount of Ore.\n\nLet's consider making an offer:\n- We could offer some Sheep or Wood for Brick since Brick is relatively valuable and we already have a substantial amount of Ore.\n\nAn example offer could be: [Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\nLet's calculate the implications:\n- Sheep: 16 - 4 = 12\n- Brick: 9 + 2 = 11\n\nNew total value = (0*5) + (16*11) + (12*16) + (11*28) + (9*34) = 0 + 176 + 192 + 308 + 306 = 982\n\nThis doesn't seem beneficial as it decreases the total value.\n\nLet's consider an alternative:\n- [Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n   - Wood: 16 - 3 = 13\n   - Brick: 9 + 1 = 10\nNew total value = (0*5) + (13*11) + (16*16) + (10*28) + (9*34) = 0 + 143 + 256 + 280 + 306 = 985\n\nStill not beneficial.\n\nLet's directly propose a potentially beneficial trade:\n[Offer: 6 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n\nLet's check the new state:\n- Wood: 16 - 6 = 10\n- Brick: 9 + 1 = 10\n\nNew total value = (0*5) + (10*11) + (16*16) + (10*28) + (9*34) = 0 + 110 + 256 + 280 + 306 = 952\n\nThis is not beneficial either.\n\nLet's think about another strategy:\nSince the last offer was rejected, we could try to make a more appealing offer or check if there's an incoming offer.\n\nHowever, given the instruction to always follow the required format and the history of the game, let's directly formulate a response based on our analysis.\n\nSince there are no new offers from Player 1 and our last offer was rejected, we can propose a new trade.\n\nLet's send: `[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]`\n\nThis is a new trade offer that might be more appealing, balancing the resources and potentially increasing the total value.\n\nResponse: `[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]`",
