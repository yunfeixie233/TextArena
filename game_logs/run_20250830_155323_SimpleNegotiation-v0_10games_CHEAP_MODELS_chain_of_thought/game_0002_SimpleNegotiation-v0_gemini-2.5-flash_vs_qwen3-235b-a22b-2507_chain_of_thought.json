I'm open to various trades, but I want to ensure my proposed exchanges are beneficial to me. I have a lot of Ore, so I might be able to leverage that, or I might try to get rid of some lower-value resources.\n\nI'll start by trying to trade some Sheep and Wood for a higher-value resource like Ore or Brick, or even a mix.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 5 Sheep -> 3 Ore]",
