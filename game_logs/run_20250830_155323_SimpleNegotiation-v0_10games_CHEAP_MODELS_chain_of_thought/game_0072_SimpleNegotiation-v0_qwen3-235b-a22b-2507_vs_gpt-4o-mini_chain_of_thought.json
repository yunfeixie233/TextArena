I notice you may have surplus Sheep for early-game development, while Wheat is low-value for me but might aid your production. Let's optimize both positions:  \n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]  \n\n*Rationale*:  \n- I give 7 Wheat (total value: 35) to receive 2 Sheep (total value: 36).  \n- This increases my total resource value by 1 (from 1,308 \u2192 1,309) while providing you compact, high-value Sheep.  \n- The near-even value ratio (35 vs. 36) ensures minimal risk for you, and the trade aligns with strategic needs (Wheat for Sheep is efficient for progression).  \n\nAccept? I'm open to adjusting quantities slightly if you counteroffer!",
