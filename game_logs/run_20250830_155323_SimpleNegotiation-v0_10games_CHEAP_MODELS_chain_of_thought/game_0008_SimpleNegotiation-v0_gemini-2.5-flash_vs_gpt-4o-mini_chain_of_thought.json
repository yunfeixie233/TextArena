Wheat is low (5).\n\nI will try to trade some Wood and Sheep for Ore or Brick.\n\nI will offer a combination of Wood and Sheep for Ore.\nLet's analyze value:\n2 Wood = 20\n1 Sheep = 14\n2 Wood + 1 Sheep = 34. This is equal to 1 Ore. I'll ask for two Ore to make a profit.\n2 Wood + 1 Sheep -> 2 Ore (Value 34 -> Value 68) - this is a bit too ambitious.\n\nLet's make a more reasonable offer that still yields profit.\nI have a lot of Wood and Sheep.\n1 Wood (10) + 1 Sheep (14) = 24.\nIf I offer 1 Wood and 1 Sheep for 1 Brick (30), I gain 6 value.
