I will make a trade offer based on the resources at my disposal that could encourage negotiation.\n\nLet's make the following new offer:\n[Offer: 4 Brick, 1 Wood -> 3 Ore]\n\nThis offer leverages valuable resources (Brick and Wood) to acquire Ore, which is highly valued. \n\nI'll proceed with this action now. \n\n**My Trade Offer:**\n[Offer: 4 Brick, 1 Wood -> 3 Ore]",
