      "response": "### Game State Analysis\n\nAs Player 0 in the Negotiation Game, I will analyze my current resources and their associated values:\n\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 10, Value: 5\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 17, Value: 12\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 25, Value: 17\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 21, Value: 22\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 17, Value: 35\n\nThe total value of my current resources is calculated as follows:\n- Total Value = (10 * 5) + (17 * 12) + (25 * 17) + (21 * 22) + (17 * 35)\n- Total Value = 50 + 204 + 425 + 462 + 595\n- Total Value = 1736\n\n### Negotiation Strategy\n\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I need to identify potentially beneficial trades. A beneficial trade is one where the value of the resources I receive is greater than the value of the resources I offer.\n\n1. **Identify Overvalued and Undervalued Resources**: \n   - The values per unit are: Wheat = 5, Wood = 12, Sheep = 17, Brick = 22, Ore = 35.\n   - Resources with higher values per unit are more valuable.\n\n2. **Potential Trades**:\n   - I should consider offering resources with lower values per unit (e.g., Wheat, Wood) for resources with higher values per unit (e.g., Ore) or similar value but potentially beneficial quantities.\n\n### Initial Offer\n\nGiven my resources and the goal to increase total value, I'll start by examining potential trades that could be beneficial. One strategy is to offer resources that are less valuable per unit in exchange for more valuable resources.\n\nLet's consider offering some of my less valuable resources (e.g., Wheat, Wood) for more valuable ones or maintaining the current distribution if it's already optimal.\n\nFor my first move, I'll make an offer that could potentially increase my total value. I'll offer some Wheat (Value: 5) and Wood (Value: 12) for Ore (Value: 35), as Ore is significantly more valuable per unit.\n\n### Offer Calculation\n\n- Offering: 5 Wheat (Value: 5*5 = 25) and 4 Wood (Value: 12*4 = 48), Total Offered Value = 25 + 48 = 73\n- Requesting: 2 Ore (Value: 35*2 = 70), which is close to the value I'm offering.\n\n### Action\n\nI'm making an initial offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Ore]`.\n\nLet's see how my opponent responds.",

Let's adjust our strategy.\n\n### Alternative Trade Offer\n\n- Offered: 7 Wheat, 5 Wood -> Requested: 2 Ore\n\nCalculation:\n- Loss: 7 Wheat (Value: 35) + 5 Wood (Value: 60) = 95\n- Gain: 2 Ore (Value: 70)\n- Net loss: -25\n\nThis is still not very beneficial.\n\n### Another Alternative Trade Offer\n\nLet's directly offer a significant amount of a lower-value resource for Ore:\n- Offered: 8 Sheep -> Requested: 3 Ore\n\nCalculation (initial quantities considered):\n- Loss: 8 Sheep (Value: 136)\n- Gain: 3 Ore (Value: 105)\n- Net loss: -31\n\nHowever, adjusting the quantities:\n- Offered: 5 Sheep -> Requested: 2 Ore\n\nCalculation:\n- Loss: 5 Sheep (Value: 85)\n- Gain: 2 Ore (Value: 70)\n- Net loss: -15\n\n### Action\n\nLet's try to make a more balanced trade offer.

Offered: 5 Wood, 2 Sheep -> Requested: 3 Brick (Accepted)\n\t+ [Wood] decreased by 5: 17 - 5 = 12\n\t+ [Sheep] decreased by 2: 25 - 2 = 23\n\t+ [Brick] increased by 3: 17 + 3 = 20\n\nCurrent resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 10   Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 12   Value: 12\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 23   Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 20   Value: 22\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 19   Value: 35\n\nThe total value of my resources initially was: \n10*5 + 17*12 + 25*17 + 21*22 + 17*35 = 50 + 204 + 425 + 462 + 595 = 1736\n\nThe total value of my resources now is:\n10*5 + 12*12 + 23*17 + 20*22 + 19*35 = 50 + 144 + 391 + 440 + 665 = 1690\n\nIt seems I've made a slightly less valuable trade. I should try to improve the total value.\n\nTo decide on the next offer, I'll examine the values and quantities of my resources:\n- I have a good amount of Sheep and Ore.\n- The value of Wheat is low, so it might be a good idea to get rid of some Wheat if possible.\n\nLet's consider a trade that could be beneficial. Since Ore is valuable and I have a decent amount, I'll think about trading some less valuable resources for something more valuable or at least equally valuable.\n\nOne possible trade could involve offering some Wheat (low value) and possibly some other less valuable resources to get something more valuable.\n\nConsidering the last trades and the resources I have, a potential offer could be:\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]\n\nThis offer gets rid of some low-value Wheat and some Wood for more valuable Brick.\n\nLet's calculate the change:\n\t+ [Wheat] decreased by 5: 10 - 5 = 5\n\t+ [Wood] decreased by 3: 12 - 3 = 9\n\t+ [Brick] increased by 2: 20 + 2 = 22\n\nNew total value if accepted:\n5*5 + 9*12 + 23*17 + 22*22 + 19*35 = 25 + 108 + 391 + 484 + 665 = 1673\n\nThis doesn't seem to increase the total value. Let's think of another trade.\n\nAnother possible trade:\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\n\t+ [Wheat] decreased by 4: 10 - 4 = 6\n\t+ [Ore] increased by 1: 19 + 1 = 20\n\nNew total value if accepted:\n6*5 + 12*12 + 23*17 + 20*22 + 20*35 = 30 + 144 + 391 + 440 + 700 = 1705\n\nThis trade slightly increases the total value.\n\nLet's propose this trade.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
