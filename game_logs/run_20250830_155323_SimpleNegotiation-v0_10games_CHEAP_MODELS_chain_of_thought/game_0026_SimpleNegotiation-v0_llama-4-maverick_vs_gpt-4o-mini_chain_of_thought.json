      "response": "### Negotiation Game - Initial Turn Analysis\n\nTo maximize the total value of my resources, I will analyze the current situation and plan my trade offers accordingly.\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n\n1. Wheat   - Qty: 11, Value: 6\n2. Wood    - Qty: 11, Value: 11\n3. Sheep   - Qty: 24, Value: 14\n4. Brick   - Qty: 18, Value: 25\n5. Ore     - Qty: 18, Value: 38\n\n#### Total Current Value:\nTo understand the starting point, let's calculate the total value of the resources I currently hold.\n- Wheat: 11 * 6 = 66\n- Wood: 11 * 11 = 121\n- Sheep: 24 * 14 = 336\n- Brick: 18 * 25 = 450\n- Ore: 18 * 38 = 684\n\nTotal Value = 66 + 121 + 336 + 450 + 684 = 1657\n\n#### Strategy for the First Turn:\nTo increase the total value, I need to identify which resources are potentially undervalued or overvalued based on their current quantities and values. \n\nUpon inspection, Ore has the highest value and is relatively abundant in my inventory. Wheat has the lowest value and is the least abundant in terms of value.\n\nA potential strategy is to offer resources that are abundant or less valuable for resources that are more valuable or scarce in my inventory.\n\n#### First Turn Offer:\nConsidering the values and quantities, I will offer Wheat (the least valuable resource) in exchange for a more valuable resource if possible.\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]' is not a fair trade in terms of value (5*6 = 30 for 1*25 = 25), so I'll think of something more balanced.\n\nLet's consider offering Sheep (Value: 14) for Brick (Value: 25), as it seems like a potentially good trade since Sheep is relatively abundant and Brick is valuable.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]' seems reasonable because 2*14 = 28 and 1*25 = 25, which is somewhat balanced.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious and attract a fair trade. Let's directly propose a trade that seems fair and valuable.\n\n#### Action for Turn 1:\n'[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]' \n\nThis offer gives away resources worth (2*14) + (1*6) = 28 + 6 = 34 for a Brick worth 25. It's not ideal, so let's adjust.\n\nA better initial offer might be:\n'[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]' \n\nThis is a simpler and more straightforward trade, offering a Sheep (Value: 14) for a Brick (Value: 25), which is a gain.\n\nLet's proceed with the simpler trade offer.\n\n#### Turn 1 Action:\n'[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]'",
