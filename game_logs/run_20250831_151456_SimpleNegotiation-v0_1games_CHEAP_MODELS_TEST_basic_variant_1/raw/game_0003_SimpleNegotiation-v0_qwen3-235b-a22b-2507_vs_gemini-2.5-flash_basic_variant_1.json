      "response": "The game is 10 rounds, and the current state shows a few rounds have passed with rejections until a recent acceptance.\nPlayer 0 accepted a trade where Player 1 gave 25 Wheat for 3 Ore.\n\nMy current resources, after the accepted trade (25 Wheat out, 3 Ore in):\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 0   Value: 5\n*   [Wood]  Qty: 11  Value: 12\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 17  Value: 12\n*   [Brick] Qty: 25  Value: 30\n*   [Ore]   Qty: 28  Value: 40 (25 + 3)\n\nTotal value of my current resources (Wealth):\n0*5 + 11*12 + 17*12 + 25*30 + 28*40\n= 0 + 132 + 204 + 750 + 1120\n= 2206\n\nThe opponent's last action was accepting my offer, and then Player 0 made no new trade offer.\nIt's my turn to propose a trade or accept/deny if there was a pending offer (which there isn't).\n\nMy strategy is to maximize wealth. This means acquiring high-value items (Ore, Brick, Wood, Sheep) and giving away lower-value items (Wheat).\nSince I have 0 Wheat, I cannot trade it.\nI have a good quantity of Brick (25) and Ore (28). These are high-value items.\nI have decent quantities of Wood (11) and Sheep (17) which are mid-value.\n\nI need to make a profitable trade. I have a lot of Brick and Ore, these are my highest value items. I am not particularly interested in trading these away unless I'm getting an even better deal.\nWood and Sheep are lower value than Brick and Ore, but still decent.\n\nLet's consider what resources the opponent might want.\nI just traded away all my Wheat to them, so they received a lot of Wheat.\nThey must have had some Ore if they gave me 3 Ore.\n\nI want to increase my wealth. Can I trade some of my Wood or Sheep for something of higher value?\nOr can I offload a little Brick or Ore for other valuable resources if offered a good ratio?\n\nLet's try to trade away some Wood or Sheep for Brick or Ore.\n\nOption 1: Trade Wood for Brick\n  - Value of Wood: 12\n  - Value of Brick: 30\n  - Trading 3 Wood (36 value) for 1 Brick (30 value) is a loss.\n  - Trading 2 Wood (24 value) for 1 Brick would be a gain for me (24 vs 30). This is unlikely for Player 0 to accept.\n\nOption 2: Trade Sheep for Brick/Ore\n  - Value of Sheep: 12\n  - Value of Brick: 30\n  - Value of Ore: 40\n  - Trading 3 Sheep (36 value) for 1 Brick (30 value) is a profitable trade for the opponent.\n  - Trading 4 Sheep (48 value) for 1 Ore (40 value) is a profitable trade for the opponent.\n\nMy goal is to obtain more high-value resources. I have a lot of Brick and Ore, and relatively less Wood and Sheep.\nGiven my high quantities of Brick and Ore, I should consider if I can consolidate wealth by trading some quantity of these for a lesser quantity of a similar or higher value resource. However, this is usually difficult.\n\nMy best bet is to get more Ore or Brick. Since I have a lot of Brick, offering some Brick for Ore might be possible if the ratio is right.\nE.g., giving 2 Brick (60 value) for 2 Ore (80 value) would be an excellent trade for me. But Player 0 would likely decline.\nOr offering 3 Brick (90 value) for 2 Ore (80 value) is a net loss for me.\n\nLet's try to convert some of my lower value (but still decent) resources into higher value resources.\nI have 11 Wood and 17 Sheep.\nIf I can trade 2 Wood (24 value) for 1 Brick (30 value), that's a gain of 6.\nIf I can trade 3 Wood (36 value) for 1 Ore (40 value), that's a gain of 4.\n\nLet's try a trade that might be appealing to Player 0 while still beneficial for me. Player 0 just accepted Wheat for Ore. This suggests they might value Wheat highly. I have no Wheat left.\n\nI have an abundance of Brick and Ore, which are my highest value resources.\nLet's try to offload some Wood for something more valuable.\n\nPlayer 0's last action was accepting my offer of 25 Wheat for 3 Ore, which means they value Wheat.\nI have no Wheat. I have plenty of Brick and Ore.\n\nI could try to trade some of my Brick for their Wood/Sheep at a favorable ratio to Player 0 to gain more different types of resources.\ne.g., [Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wood]. My value: 30. Their value: 36. This is a loss for me.\n\nHow about trying to get more Ore, since it's the highest value?\nI can offer a combination of lower-value items (Wood, Sheep) for Ore.\nCurrent wealth: 2206.\n\nLet's try to increase my Ore quantity.\nI could offer a fair amount of Sheep or Wood.\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Wood] (60 value -> 24 value) - This is a bad trade for me.\n\nMy goal is to increase my wealth.\nConsider the cost vs. benefit.\nI have 25 Brick (value 30) and 28 Ore (value 40).\nI have 11 Wood (value 12) and 17 Sheep (value 12).\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (30 value) for 1 Wood (12 value) + 1 Sheep (12 value)? This is a 30 vs 24 value trade, net loss for me.\n\nI should try to gain high-value resources (Ore, Brick).\nWhat if I offer 3 Wood (36 value) for 1 Brick (30 value)? This is a loss for me.\nWhat if I offer 2 Wood (24 value) for 1 Brick (30 value)? This is a gain of 6 for me, but sounds like Player 0 would not accept it.\n\nHow about offering some Brick for Ore?\nMaybe Player 0 has a lot of Ore and wants variety.\nMy Brick value: 30. My Ore value: 40.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (90 value) for 2 Ore (80 value), this is a loss for me.\nIf I offer 4 Brick (120 value) for 3 Ore (120 value)? This is neutral. No gain.\n\nI'm strong in Brick and Ore. I'm weakest in Wheat (0).\nLet's try to get more Ore.\nI will propose a trade that gives away some of my current mid-value resources (Wood, Sheep) for high-value Ore.\n\nProposal: [Offer: 4 Wood, 4 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\nValue of what I give: (4 * 12) + (4 * 12) = 48 + 48 = 96\nValue of what I want: 2 * 40 = 80\nThis is a loss for me (96 vs 80). Player 0 will definitely take it. I want to win.\n\nLet's reverse it.\nI want to gain value.\nI will give up low-value items for high-value items.\nI have no low-value items like Wheat.\nTherefore, I need to look for trades where I get more value than I give.\n\nHow about trading Brick or Ore for other resources *if I get an excellent ratio*?\nThis is unlikely to happen.\n\nPlayer 0's last move was: Player 0 accepted the trade offer from Player 1. Player 0 made no new trade offer.\nThere's no pending offer from Player 0, so I must make an offer.\n\nLet's try to trade some Wood and Sheep for Brick or Ore.\nI have 11 Wood and 17 Sheep.\nSuppose I try to get one Brick.\n[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick] My gain: 30 - 24 = 6. Unlikely Player 0 accepts.\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick] My gain: 30 - 36 = -6. This is a loss for me.\n\nLet's offer a combination of lower-value items for a higher-value single item.\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nValue of what I give: (2 * 12) + (2 * 12) = 24 + 24 = 48\nValue of what I get: 1 * 30 = 30\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nI need to be very careful.\nI have 25 Brick and 28 Ore. These are my biggest assets.\nI am relatively low on Wood (11) and Sheep (17) in comparison.\n\nI can make a trade where I offer a relatively small number of a high-value item for a slightly higher value item to try and consolidate my wealth into Ore, which has the highest value. But this is risky.\nExample: I offer 2 Brick (60 value) for 2 Ore (80 value). This is a gain of 20 for me. This is ideal but Player 0 might not accept.\n\nWhat if I offer something that seems appealing to Player 0 while still giving me a slight edge?\nPlayer 0 recently accepted Wheat. I have no Wheat.\nPlayer 0 gave me 3 Ore. Maybe they have less Ore now? Or they have a lot.\n\nI want to make a trade that has a net positive value for me.\n\nLet's try and convert some Wood/Sheep into Brick/Ore.\nConsider the quantities. I have 11 Wood, 17 Sheep.\nIf I offer 3 Wood (36 value) for 1 Ore (40 value), I gain 4. This is a good trade for me, but they lose 4.\nIf I offer 4 Wood (48 value) for 1 Ore (40 value), I lose 8 for the trade, but I get Ore diversification. I don't want to lose value.\n\nLet's try to trade away some Brick for Ore. This would be consolidating my high-value assets.\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore] This is 90 value going out, for 80 value incoming. Loss of 10.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 2 Ore] This is 60 value going out, for 80 value incoming. Gain of 20. This is probably too good for me and Player 0 will deny.\n\nI need to make an offer that Player 0 might accept, and that increases my wealth.\nPlayer 0 did deny my offer on previous rounds.\n\nLet's consider that I have a LOT of Brick (25) and Ore (28). I'm quite rich in these.\nPerhaps I can trade some of these for other valuable resources, but only if it's profitable.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Wood, 1 Sheep] (30 value out, 24 value in). LOSS.\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick] (40 value out, 60 value in). GAIN. Too good for me.\n\nPlayer 0's last move was accepting my offer of 25 Wheat for 3 Ore previously. This means they like Wheat. I have none.\n\nLet's try to acquire more Ore, as it's the highest value.\nI'm going to propose a trade that gives Player 0 some of my lower count resources (Wood and Sheep) for Ore.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nValue Given: (3 * 12) + (3 * 12) = 36 + 36 = 72\nValue Received: 1 * 40 = 40\nThis is a significant loss (72 vs 40). Player 0 will accept, but I will lose wealth. This is not what I want.\n\nI want to win the game. I need to get more value than I give.\n\nWhat if I try to acquire Brick? It's the next highest value.\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nValue Given: (2 * 12) + (2 * 12) = 48\nValue Received: 1 * 30 = 30\nThis is a loss.\n\nI need to formulate a trade that has a positive net value for me, but is also potentially acceptable to Player 0.\n\nSince I have a lot of Brick and Ore, especially Brick, I can try to use these to gain other resources.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 2 Wood]\nValue given: 30\nValue received: 2 * 12 = 24\nLoss of 6. No.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wood]\nValue given: 30\nValue received: 3 * 12 = 36\nGain of 6! This is a viable trade. I give 1 Brick for 3 Wood. Player 0 gets 1 Brick. I get 3 Wood. My Brick goes down to 24, Wood up to 14.\nThis looks like a good trade for me, and potentially acceptable for Player 0 as they get a high-value resource.\n\nLet's check the new wealth if this trade goes through successfully:\nCurrent: 0*5 + 11*12 + 17*12 + 25*30 + 28*40 = 2206\nProposed: Give 1 Brick (30), Get 3 Wood (36). Net change +6.\nNew wealth = 2206 + 6 = 2212.\nThis seems like a solid strategy. I will give away some of my abundant Brick to acquire a resource I have less of (Wood) at a profitable ratio.\n\nLet's confirm the offer:\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wood]\n\nThis is my move.\nThe game shows Player 0 recently \"accepted the trade offer from Player 1\", and then \"Player 0 made no new trade offer.\"\nSo it's my turn to make an offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wood\"}\n```",
