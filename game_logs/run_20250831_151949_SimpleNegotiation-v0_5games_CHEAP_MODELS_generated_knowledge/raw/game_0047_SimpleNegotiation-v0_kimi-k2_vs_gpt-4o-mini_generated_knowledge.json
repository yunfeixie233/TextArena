Acquiring more Brick is critical for long-term power, as it enables high-end trades later.  \n   - **Sheep is expendable**: With 20 Sheep, I can afford to trade 3\u20135 Sheep without hurting my core value.  \n   - **Test willingness first**: Start with small, asymmetric offers to gauge the other player\u2019s resource priorities (e.g., 3 Sheep for 2 Brick shows if they value Sheep higher than default).  \n\n4. **Negotiation Psychology**  \n   - **Anchoring**: The first offer sets the tone; lowballing (e.g., 3 Sheep for 5 Brick) risks rejection, but offering 4 Sheep for 4 Brick might reveal flexibility.  \n   - **Tradeoff asymmetry**: Offer excess mid-tier (Sheep) for undersupplied high-tier (Brick), leveraging their potential surplus.  \n\n---\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Decision\n\n**Goal**: Acquire Brick without overpaying.

This is **slightly favorable to me** (net +40 value), but the 2 Sheep return softens the loss for the opponent if they lack Brick.  \n\n**Rationale**:  \n- Tests if the opponent values Brick <35 (if they counter higher Brick, adjust).  \n- Preserves all Ore except 2, crucial for future high-value trading.  \n- Sheep surplus allows giving 3 upfront and 2 Sheep back, balancing perceived loss.  \n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]",

Each resource has a different value per quantity, and assessing the total value before trading will help determine if a trade is beneficial.\n\n2. **Scarcity and Demand**: Some resources may be more desirable or scarce in the current game context. Evaluating which resources players are likely to need or want can enhance negotiation effectiveness.\n\n3. **Trade Ratios**: Knowing the potential trade ratios for resources can help assess if a trade is advantageous.

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\n1. **Understanding Resource Value**: Each resource has a specific value, and the goal of trading is to maximize the total value of your resources. Before trading, assess the total value of your current inventory and compare it against the value of the resources you would acquire in the trade.\n\n2. **Trade Fairness**: Successful negotiations involve finding a fair balance where both parties feel they benefit. It often helps to perceive resources through the lens of utility; for instance, consider how the resources will help your overall game strategy.\n\n3. **Scarcity and Demand**: The value of a resource can fluctuate based on how many are available in the game and how many are desired by others. If a resource is plentiful for you but scarce for others, you may leverage that to negotiate better deals.\n\n4. **Building Relationships**: Maintaining a good rapport with other players can facilitate future trades. Being seen as fair and trustworthy can encourage more advantageous trades down the line.\n\n5. **Timing of Offers**: Before making a trade, consider the timing; too many trades too quickly can leave you exposed to less favorable deals if your resources become more reliant on the few held by other players.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision\n\nConsidering the recent trade offers and Player 0's last offer: they proposed to exchange 4 Sheep and 1 Wood for 5 Brick. \n\n- **Current Resources After Previous Trades**:\n  - Wheat: 9    Value: 5\n  - Wood: 12   Value: 12 (after the previous trades)\n  - Sheep: 5    Value: 15 (after the previous trades)\n  - Brick: 8    Value: 26 (after the previous trades)\n  - Ore: 21     Value: 33 (after the previous trades)\n\n- **Evaluating the Last Offer**:\n  - Resources Offered: 4 Sheep (Value: 15) and 1 Wood (Value: 12) totals **27 value**.\n  - Resources Requested: 5 Brick (Value: 26).\n\nThis trade would slightly benefit me by trading away resources that currently do not fulfill urgent needs for bricks, which increase the overall capacity I possess. However, it reduces the quantity of sheep that could be useful later and has a trade value that is close to even.\n\nBut considering that the current trade does not bring substantial increase in total value and may weaken my bargaining position later on, I should **deny this trade offer**.\n\n### Final Decision\n[Deny]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. Marginal ticket pricing: after the exchanges, Brick is by far the scarcest and most valuable resource (only 2 left, value 25 each), while Ore remains abundant (12 left, value 35 each) and Sheep is still plentiful (9 left, value 15 each).  This suggests Brick adds more marginal value to me than any other good.  \n2. Leverage abundance: Player 1 repeatedly accepts trades that provide him low-value materials (Wood, Wheat, Sheep) in exchange for Brick\u2014the hard-to-get resource\u2014even when the Brick exchange rate is slightly worse than the raw point totals.  This indicates an eager Brick buyer.  \n3. Offer structure sweet spot: The trades that were accepted gave Player 1 4-7 points worth of goods for each Brick received (3 Brick \u2248 75 points in exchange for \u2248 60\u201375 points).  Offers that tried to pick up 5 Brick in one shot were rejected, implying a ceiling on Bundle size.  \n4.

Sheep & Wood surplus: Relative to their values, I have still more Sheep (9) and Wood (9) than usual; they remain the cheapest-to-spend resources when trying to capture more Brick.\n\nApplying the insight: propose a modest bundle that dangles above-average value per Brick while taking advantage of my surpluses and staying under the apparent 3\u20134 Brick limit that Player 1 is willing to part with.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 1 Ore -> 4 Brick]",

      "response": "**Generated Knowledge:**\n\n1. **Value Assessment**: Calculate the total value of my resources before trading. Each resource has a specific quantity and value associated with it. Understanding the value of what I have compared to what I am offered is key.\n\n2. **Resource Comparison**: Compare the resources offered by Player 0 with my existing resources. Determine which trades align with my goals for increasing the total value of my assets.\n\n3. **Negotiation Leverage**: Think about how the scarcity or abundance of certain resources may provide bargaining power in trades. For example, if I have a lot of Wood but need more Brick, I might be more willing to trade Wood or other resources for Brick.\n\n4. **Future Trading Potential**: Consider the future implications of any trade. Will the proposed trade result in a resource imbalance that would limit potential future trades? A well-balanced trade might not only maximally increase current resources but also strengthen future bargaining positions.\n\n5. **Strategic Denials**: Sometimes, denying offers (as seen in previous turns) can lead to better offers in subsequent turns. Be cautious about accepting trades that do not result in valuable increases.\n\n**Current Evaluation of Resources**:\n- **Wheat**: 9 Qty, Value 5\n- **Wood**: 14 Qty, Value 12\n- **Sheep**: 9 Qty, Value 15\n- **Brick**: 15 Qty, Value 26\n- **Ore**: 23 Qty, Value 33\n\n**Current Trading Situation from Player 0**:\n- Player 0's current offer: *Offered items: 4 Sheep, 1 Ore -> Requested items: 4 Brick*\n\n**Value Analysis of the Current Offer**:\n- 4 Sheep have a value of 15. \n- 1 Ore has a value of 33. \n- Total offered value: 15 + 33 = 48\n- 4 Brick have a value of 26. \n- Total requested value: 26\n\nBy accepting, I would effectively give away resources worth 48 to receive resources worth 26, which does not increase my total value.\n\n**Decision**: Given this analysis and my goal to increase total value, the best course of action is to reject the current trade offer from Player 0 because the value exchange is not favorable.\n\n**Next Move**:\n- '[Deny]'",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n- Scarcity & Valuation: Brick has the highest per-unit value (25) and I only start with 8; Ore (35) is next, and I still have 17 remaining, so using Ore as the premium sweetener keeps it scarce while trading away comparatively abundant Sheep (20 units, 15 value) and Wood (18, 8) is acceptable.\n\n- Marginal Utility & Expanding Brick Position: My marginal gain per Brick is +25 value; giving up 1 Ore for 1 Brick is a positive trade (25 \u2013 35 = \u201110 value change, but only affects the margin\u2014I still have 15 Ore). Every Brick I obtain raises the total value of my portfolio more than any other resource I currently produce in excess.\n\n- Mirror Values & Persuasion: Opposite players value their scarce resources higher. My repeat rejections for 5-Brick offers might be due to my insisting on 5-for-multi-resource swaps; an efficient 1-for-1 or 2-for-1 Ore-to-Brick package is less painful to them while still netting me high value brick. \n\n- Resource Convexity: When arranging packages, offering the opponent resources they appear to accept\u2014such as my 2 Wood + 1 Ore for 3 Brick that Player 1 accepted once before\u2014can work again because they preferred mixed low-value+high-value payout. Player 1 hasn\u2019t accepted Sheep-heavy deals when Brick quantity exceeds 3.\n\n- Adjusting Package Size: 4-resource offers (4 Sheep + 1 Wood for 5 Brick) failed twice, but 3-to-5 size ratios like my first proposal didn\u2019t succeed either. A smaller, high-leverage trade is more likely\u2014e.g., 2 Ore for 3 Brick (total value exchange: +75 me \u21d4 \u201150 opponent net loss, but persuasion by offering extras or direct Ore could still suffice).\n\nApply Knowledge \u2013 Decision for Turn 7:\n\nPlayer 0 has now placed and completed four offers and most recently was rejected on a 4 Sheep + 1 Ore for 4 Brick bid. Brick count in vault is expected to be limited for Player 1, so pushing smaller, premium Ore trades should improve acceptance odds while continuing to shore up my Brick balance.\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore, 3 Wood -> 4 Brick]",
