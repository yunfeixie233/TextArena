      "response": "### Generate Knowledge:\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are particularly relevant to my current situation as Player 0. First, **value maximization** is crucial: I should only engage in trades where the total value of resources I receive exceeds the value of those I give up, based on my personal valuation. My resources have varying values (e.g., Wheat at 6 per unit vs. Ore at 32 per unit), so I should prioritize trading low-value resources (like Wheat) for high-value ones (like Ore) to increase my overall portfolio value.\n\nSecond, **resource abundance and scarcity** play a role: I have high quantities of Wheat (19) and Ore (18), making them easier to trade without depleting my stock, whereas resources like Brick (10 units) are more limited and should be guarded unless the return is exceptionally valuable. This aligns with the strategy of **leveraging excess resources** to acquire what I lack or value more.\n\nThird, **negotiation strategy** involves offering trades that are attractive to the other party while ensuring a net gain for myself. This means starting with reasonable offers that provide mutual benefit, avoiding overreaching to prevent rejection, and considering the game's limited turns (10 total), so I should aim for incremental gains early on. Additionally, **risk management** is key\u2014don't trade away high-value items unless absolutely necessary, and always calculate the opportunity cost.\n\nFinally, insights from game theory suggest **asymmetry in information**: I don't know the other players' valuations, so I should base trades on my own metrics and start conservatively to test the waters. Overall, successful trades hinge on balancing short-term gains with long-term game progression.\n\n### Apply Knowledge:\nBased on the generated knowledge, I've evaluated my current resources and total value (calculated as 1225). I have an abundance of low-value resources like Wheat (value: 6 per unit), which I can afford to trade, and a strong interest in acquiring more high-value resources like Ore (value: 32 per unit) to maximize my total value. By offering 10 Wheat (total value: 10 * 6 = 60), I'm giving up a relatively low-value asset that I have in excess, while requesting 2 Ore (total value: 2 * 32 = 64). This results in a net value gain of +4, aligning with the principle of value maximization. It also leverages my resource abundance without risking scarce items like Brick. Given the early stage of the game, this conservative offer tests negotiation waters while building toward long-term gains. Therefore, I'll initiate this trade.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are crucial for maximizing the total value of my resources. First, **value assessment** is essential; I must calculate the net value gain or loss from any trade by comparing the values of resources I offer against those I receive, ensuring that the trade increases my overall portfolio value. For instance, resources like Ore (value: 32) and Brick (value: 25) are high-value, so I should prioritize acquiring them if possible, while trading away lower-value resources like Wheat (value: 6). Second, **negotiation adaptability** involves learning from rejections; my previous offer of 10 Wheat (worth 60 total value) for 2 Ore (worth 64 total value) was nearly balanced but rejected, suggesting Player 1 may not value Wheat highly or has an abundance of Ore, so I should adjust by offering different resources or sweeter deals. Third, **mutual benefit and scarcity** principles dictate that successful trades require proposing offers that could appeal to the other player\u2014perhaps by targeting resources they might lack\u2014while maintaining my advantage; for example, diversifying my high-value holdings like Brick could enhance my long-term position. Finally, with only 10 turns in the game, I need to be **efficient and proactive**, making calculated offers that minimize risk and build on insights from past interactions to avoid stalemates.\n\n### Trading Decision\n\nApplying this knowledge, I recognize that my previous offer was rejected, likely because it didn't sufficiently appeal to Player 1 or offered resources they didn't need. To increase my total value, I should propose a new trade that gives me a net gain\u2014such as exchanging lower-value resources for higher-value ones like Brick. Specifically, I'll offer 10 Wheat (total value: 60) for 3 Brick (total value: 75), resulting in a net gain of 15 value for me. This adjusts based on the rejection and targets a potentially desirable resource for Player 1.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Brick]",

      "response": "Below, I'll follow the instructions step by step. First, I'll generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation based on my current situation. Then, I'll apply that knowledge to make my trading decision.\n\n### Generate Knowledge\nKey principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation relevant to my situation as Player 0 include:\n\n- **Value Maximization**: In resource trading, the primary goal is to increase the total value of your resources. I should prioritize trading away low-value resources (e.g., Wheat at 6 value) for high-value ones (e.g., Ore at 32 value or Brick at 25 value). This ensures a net gain in overall value, as seen in my resource list where Wheat and Wood are among my lowest-value items, while Ore and Brick are the highest. A good rule is to only accept or propose trades where the incoming resources' total value exceeds the outgoing ones.\n\n- **Negotiation and Adjustment**: Previous offers can provide insights into the other player's preferences. My recent offers (10 Wheat for 2 Ore, and 10 Wheat for 3 Brick) were both rejected, suggesting that Player 1 may not value Wheat highly, might have surpluses of Ore or Brick, or could be seeking a better deal. A key strategy is to iterate by adjusting offers\u2014perhaps by including a mix of resources, reducing what I offer, or sweetening the deal slightly to make it more appealing while still ensuring I gain value. For instance, combining low-value items (like Wheat) with medium-value ones (like Sheep) could create a more balanced proposal.\n\n- **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: I have abundant quantities of most resources (e.g., 19 Wheat, 17 Wood), so I can afford to trade them without depleting my stock. However, with only 10 turns in the game, I need to act efficiently to avoid wasting opportunities. Insights from negotiation theory suggest starting with offers that are fair but slightly in the other player's favor to build goodwill, then refining based on rejections. Additionally, avoid overcommitting high-value resources (like Ore) early, as they could be key for future trades or end-game scoring.\n\n- **Risk Management and Fairness Perception**: Trades should appear reasonably fair to the other player to reduce rejection risk, but as a competitive player, I must ensure my net gain. For example, if I offered 60 value (10 Wheat) for 64-75 value previously and it was rejected, Player 1 might be undervaluing my offers or prioritizing different resources. A principle here is to use incremental concessions\u2014e.g., add variety to offers\u2014while monitoring for patterns in rejections.\n\n- **Game Context**: With limited turns, persistence in negotiation is important, but I should avoid repetitive offers that fail. Insights from competitive games emphasize adaptability: if one resource (like Wheat) isn't working, diversify to include others (e.g., Sheep) to test preferences.\n\nThese principles guide me to propose trades that maximize my value while adapting to past rejections.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge, I need to make a decision that increases my total resource value. My previous offers focused on Wheat, which were rejected, so I'll diversify by including Sheep (a medium-value resource I have in moderate quantity) alongside Wheat. This creates a more appealing package while ensuring I gain net value.\n\nSpecifically:\n- I'll offer 5 Wheat (value: 5 * 6 = 30) and 2 Sheep (value: 2 * 12 = 24), for a total offered value of 54.\n- In return, I'll request 1 Ore (value: 1 * 32 = 32) and 1 Brick (value: 1 * 25 = 25), for a total requested value of 57.\n- This results in a net gain for me (gaining 57 value while giving 54), but it's close enough to fair to potentially entice Player 1. It also uses my abundant Wheat and some Sheep, preserving my high-value Ore.\n\nSince there's no incoming offer from Player 1, I'll make this new offer.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \nIn resource-based negotiation games, several key principles apply to maximize value:\n\n1. **Resource Valuation**: Each resource has an intrinsic value to you based on your current holdings and their utility. Since your goal is to increase the *total value* of your resources, you should prioritize acquiring high-value resources (like Ore at 33) and avoid giving them up unless compensated well. Conversely, lower-value resources (like Wheat at 5) are more disposable if in surplus.\n\n2. **Surplus and Scarcity**: You have large quantities of Wheat (21), Wood (24), and Brick (24), while Sheep (5) and Ore (21) are comparatively smaller. However, Ore is very high-value, so preserving or increasing Ore is crucial. Wheat, being low-value and abundant, can be used strategically in trades.\n\n3. **Trade Efficiency**: Favor trades that increase your total inventory value. This means receiving resources of higher aggregate value than what you give, especially gaining high-value units (Ore, Brick) in exchange for low-value surplus (Wheat, possibly Wood or Sheep if needed).\n\n4. **Opportunity Cost**: Giving up 1 Ore (value 33) should yield returns significantly exceeding 33 in value. Similarly, giving up 10 Wheat (total value 50) can be acceptable if you gain resources worth more than 50 in return.\n\n5. **Negotiation Leverage**: Player 0 has repeatedly offered Wheat in exchange for your higher-value resources (Ore, Brick), which would decrease your total value. Rejecting those offers is rational. However, counter-offers can shift the balance in your favor.\n\n6. **Counter-Offer Strategy**: Since Player 0 seems to value Wheat (offering 5\u201310), and you have surplus Wheat, you can use it to request higher-value resources from them, especially Sheep or Ore.\n\nNow evaluating Player 0's latest offer:  \nOffered: 5 Wheat (5\u00d75 = 25 value), 2 Sheep (2\u00d714 = 28) \u2192 Total offered value: 53  \nRequested: 1 Ore (33), 1 Brick (27) \u2192 Total requested value: 60  \nThis offer is **unfavorable** to you: you would lose value (60 given vs. 53 received). Moreover, Ore is extremely high-value; losing even one unit requires excellent compensation.\n\nHowever, a *counter-offer* could reverse this: use your surplus Wheat and possibly Sheep to *gain* Ore or Brick.\n\nPotential high-value trade: Offer 5 Wheat + 2 Sheep (value 53) to request 2 Ore (66 value) \u2014 favorable to you. Or request 1 Ore (33) + 2 Brick (54) = 87 value \u2014 very favorable, but may be too aggressive.\n\nA balanced counter: Offer 5 Wheat + 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore  \nThat gives you net value gain: +33 (Ore) - 53 (given) = -20? Wait \u2014 no: you give 5\u00d75 + 2\u00d714 = 25+28=53, gain 33 \u2192 net loss of 20. Not good.\n\nWait \u2014 miscalculation: if *you* are **receiving** 1 Ore (value 33), and **giving** 5 Wheat (25) and 2 Sheep (28), total given value = 53, received = 33 \u2192 **net loss of 20**. So even if they offer it, it's bad *for them* \u2014 but you shouldn't accept or make such a trade.\n\nBut their offer is **5 Wheat, 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore, 1 Brick** to *you*, meaning *they* give 5W, 2S; *you* give 1O, 1B.  \nSo you **lose** 1 Ore (33) and 1 Brick (27) = 60 value  \nYou **gain** 5 Wheat (25) and 2 Sheep (28) = 53 value  \n\u2192 Net loss of 7 value. Hence, **reject**.\n\nBut now, **make a favorable offer**.\n\nYou want to **gain** Ore or Brick, not lose them.\n\nUse your surplus: Wheat (21), Wood (24), Brick (24). But Brick is high value \u2014 avoid giving unless getting high return.\n\nBest offer: Offer **Wheat + Wood** (lower value per unit) for **Ore**.\n\nExample: Offer 10 Wheat (50) + 3 Wood (33) = 83 value \u2192 Request 2 Ore (66) \u2192 acceptable if they value Wheat/Wood higher.\n\nBut better: Offer 5 Wheat (25) + 2 Wood (22) = 47 \u2192 Request 1 Ore (33) \u2014 still poor net gain? 33 vs 47 given \u2192 loss.\n\nWait \u2014 **goal is to *increase* total value**.\n\nSo: you must **receive** resources of higher total value than you give.\n\nThus, **ask for more than you offer**.\n\nFeasible favorable trade:  \nOffer: 5 Wheat (25) + 5 Wood (55) = 80 value  \nRequest: 3 Ore (99) \u2014 possible if they have surplus Ore.\n\nBut maybe too aggressive.\n\nBetter: Offer 10 Wheat (50) + 1 Sheep (14) = 64  \nRequest: 2 Ore (66) \u2192 slight gain.\n\nOr: Offer 10 Wheat + 2 Sheep = 50 + 28 = 78 \u2192 Request 2 Ore + 1 Brick = 66 + 27 = 93 \u2192 good gain.\n\nBut do you want to give 2 Sheep? You have only 5.\n\nAlternative: Use Wood.\n\nOffer: 10 Wheat (50) + 5 Wood (55) = 105 \u2192 Request 3 Ore (99) \u2192 slight loss, not good.\n\nWait \u2014 simplify.\n\nBest approach: **target inefficiency in their valuation**.\n\nThey keep offering Wheat \u2014 so they either have surplus Wheat or value it low.\n\nThey keep requesting Ore and Brick \u2014 so they value those highly.\n\nTherefore, **they are willing to spend Wheat to get your Ore/Brick**.\n\nYou should do the **reverse**: spend your **surplus Wheat** to get **their** Ore.\n\nBut they aren\u2019t offering Ore \u2014 so **propose a trade where you give Wheat and get Ore**.\n\nYou have 21 Wheat \u2014 plenty.\n\nSo counter with:\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\n\nLet\u2019s compute:\n- You give: 5\u00d75 = 25, 2\u00d714 = 28 \u2192 total 53\n- You receive: 2\u00d733 = 66\n- Net gain: +13 value \u2192 favorable.\n\nAnd you only have 5 Sheep \u2014 giving 2 is manageable if it increases total value.\n\nAlternatively, avoid using Sheep.\n\nOffer: 10 Wheat (50) + 2 Wood (22) = 72 \u2192 Request 2 Ore (66) \u2192 loss of 6 \u2192 bad.\n\nOffer: 3 Wheat (15) + 3 Wood (33) = 48 \u2192 Request 1 Ore (33) \u2192 loss of 15 \u2192 bad.\n\nWait \u2014 hard to get Ore without giving high combined value.\n\nBut **Ore is 33 each \u2014 very high**.

They may not have both.\n\nBut you can propose.\n\nEven better: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 2 Sheep, 1 Ore] = 30 \u2192 28+33=61 \u2014 gain +31? 61-30=31 \u2014 wait no:\n\nYou give 6 Wheat = 6\u00d75 = 30  \nYou receive 1 Ore (33) + 2 Sheep (28) = 61  \nNet gain: +31 \u2014 impossible? No, only if valuations are asymmetric.\n\nBut in the game, valuations are fixed per player? The values are given to *you* \u2014 we assume they have same values? Not stated.\n\nBut game says: \"associated values you currently have\" \u2014 so *your* valuation.\n\nBut the other player may have different valuations.\n\nBut we don't know.\n\nSo you must act on your own valuation: **increase total value of your resources**.\n\nSo if you can trade 6 Wheat (value 30 to you) for 1 Ore (33) and 2 Sheep (28), total received value 61, your total value increases by 31 \u2014 massive gain.\n\nEven if they benefit, you gain.\n\nBut likely, they won\u2019t accept giving 61 value for 30.\n\nBut it's worth offering if there's a chance.\n\nBut perhaps too optimistic.\n\nMore balanced: [Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep] = give 50, get 47 \u2192 loss of 3 \u2014 bad.\n\nWait \u2014 only trades where you get more value than you give.\n\nSo minimum: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore] \u2192 gain +3\n\nOr [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Sheep] \u2192 25 vs 28 \u2192 gain +3\n\nBut better to gain Ore.\n\nBest conservative: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nBut let's confirm: do you have 6 Wheat? Yes, 21.\n\nWill it increase total value? Yes, by 3.\n\nAny offer with net **zero or negative** should be avoided.\n\nBut you can combine.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep] = give 30+11=41, get 33+14=47 \u2192 gain +6\n\nBetter than just Ore.\n\nBut uses Wood.\n\nStill good.\n\nBut simpler to use only Wheat.\n\nFinal decision: make an offer that gives you net positive value.\n\nBest: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nBut earlier calculation shows [Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore + 1 Sheep] is possible? Only if they accept.\n\nBut 7 Wheat = 35, 1 Ore+1 Sheep=47, gain +12.\n\nStill, you have 21 Wheat.\n\nBut let\u2019s pick one.\n\nGiven Player 0's last offer involved 5 Wheat and 2 Sheep, they may be open to Wheat-based trades.\n\nSo propose: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nBut to get more value, offer:\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]\n\nGive 40, get 47 \u2192 +7\n\nYes.\n\nOr even: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep, 1 Ore] \u2192 25 vs 47 \u2192 gain +22 \u2014 but likely rejected.\n\nStart with reasonable.\n\nSince they offered 5 Wheat + 2 Sheep for 1 Ore + 1 Brick (which you rejected), they value Ore and Brick.\n\nSo they may be willing to trade Ore away only for high cost.\n\nBut perhaps not.\n\nWait \u2014 they are requesting Ore from you \u2014 so they want it, won't give it.\n\nSo likely **they don\u2019t want to give Ore**.\n\nSo offering Wheat for Ore may not work.\n\nBut you must try.\n\nAlternatively, **no good outgoing offer possible**.\n\nBut you should at least try.\n\nPerhaps propose trade for something they have.\n\nThey offered Wheat \u2014 so may have surplus.\n\nThey might have Sheep \u2014 since they offered 2.\n\nSo [Offer: X Wheat -> 2 Sheep]\n\nValue: 2 Sheep = 28\n\nSo give <=5 Wheat (25) for 2 Sheep? 5 Wheat =25 < 28 \u2192 gain +3\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Sheep] \u2192 gain +3\n\nPossible.\n\nGood small gain.\n\nOr [Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Sheep] = 20 vs 14 \u2192 loss \u2192 bad.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Sheep] = 25 vs 28 \u2192 gain +3\n\nYes.\n\nBut Sheep is only 14 \u2014 Ore is 33, better.\n\nBut if Ore not tradable, Sheep is second best.\n\nBut you have 5 Sheep \u2014 not low.\n\nNet gain still positive.\n\nBut better to try for Ore.\n\nGiven the risk, best to make a balanced offer.\n\nFinal decision: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis increases your total value by +3 if accepted.\n\nIt uses surplus Wheat to gain the highest-value resource.\n\nOther trades risk value loss.\n\nSo go with that.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are crucial for maximizing the total value of my resources, especially in a limited-turn game like this one with only 10 turns. Here's a breakdown of the most relevant insights based on my current situation:\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: The primary goal is to ensure that any trade increases the net value of my resources. I must calculate the total value of resources I'm giving versus receiving using my assigned values (e.g., Wheat: 6, Wood: 9, Sheep: 12, Brick: 25, Ore: 32). A trade should only be accepted if the incoming resources' value exceeds the outgoing ones, creating a net gain. This prevents losses and builds long-term advantage.\n\n2. **Scarcity and Opportunity Cost**: I have abundant quantities of high-value resources like Ore (18 qty, value 32) and Brick (10 qty, value 25), which others might desire. Conversely, I should seek resources that complement my needs or have higher utility in future trades. However, trading away scarce or high-value items (like Ore) should be done sparingly, only if I gain more value in return, to avoid depleting my strengths.\n\n3. **Negotiation Dynamics**: In a back-and-forth game, persistence is key, but so is adaptability. My previous offers (e.g., offering Wheat and Sheep for Ore and Brick) were rejected, indicating Player 1 may not value what I offered or finds the terms unfavorable. I should counter with improved offers that are more appealing\u2014perhaps by reducing what I give or increasing what I ask\u2014while staying above my value threshold. Rejecting unfair incoming offers maintains leverage, and counter-offers can test the other player's boundaries.\n\n4. **Risk and Turn Management**: With only 10 turns, I need to avoid stagnant or loss-making trades that waste opportunities. If an offer doesn't benefit me, deny it quickly and propose a counter that advances negotiations. Building goodwill through fair but advantageous trades can encourage future agreements, but I must prioritize my gains.\n\n5. **Fairness and Perception**: Trades that are perceived as balanced (even if slightly in my favor) are more likely to be accepted. For example, if Player 1 consistently rejects my offers, I should adjust based on their interests (e.g., they seem interested in Ore, as per their offer) while ensuring I don't overgive.\n\nThese principles apply directly to my situation, where I have high-value resources to leverage but must avoid trades that decrease my total value.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Make Trading Decision\n\nEvaluating Player 1's incoming offer: They offered 5 Wheat and 2 Sheep for 2 Ore.\n\n- Value of what I'd receive: 5 Wheat (5 * 6 = 30) + 2 Sheep (2 * 12 = 24) = 54 total value.\n- Value of what I'd give: 2 Ore (2 * 32 = 64) total value.\n- Net change: -10 value (a loss).\n\nThis trade would decrease my total resource value, violating the principle of value maximization. Therefore, I must deny it to avoid a net loss and preserve my high-value Ore.\n\nNow, applying negotiation dynamics, I'll counter with a new offer that benefits me. Player 1 seems interested in Ore, so I'll offer just 1 Ore (value 32) in exchange for 5 Wheat and 2 Sheep (value 54). This gives me a net gain of +22 value, aligns with their previous offer structure, and tests if they're willing to adjust. This counters their rejected offers while managing turn limitations.\n\nAction: [Deny] the incoming offer from Player 1, then make a new offer.\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**:  \n   - The value of each resource you hold is:  \n     - Wheat: 5 (lowest)  \n     - Wood: 11  \n     - Sheep: 14  \n     - Brick: 27  \n     - Ore: 33 (highest)  \n   This means Ore is your most valuable resource, followed by Brick. Wheat is your least valuable. Trading low-value resources to acquire high-value ones increases your total asset value.\n\n2. **Trade Efficiency**:  \n   A good trade improves your total portfolio value. Always compare the total value of resources offered vs. requested.  \n   For example: Giving up 5 Wheat (5\u00d75 = 25) and 2 Sheep (2\u00d714 = 28) \u2192 total cost = 53  \n   In return, getting 1 Ore (33) and 1 Brick (27) = 60 \u2192 net gain of 7. This is favorable.\n\n3. **Negotiation Dynamics and Reciprocity**:  \n   Player 0 has made three offers, all involving Wheat (which they have in excess) for Ore or Brick (which you have). They seem eager to trade up the value chain.  \n   You previously offered 5 Wheat + 2 Sheep for 2 Ore (value: 53 \u2192 66), which is strong, but was rejected. Now Player 0 counters with 1 Ore for 5 Wheat + 2 Sheep \u2014 which is *worse* for you: you'd give up 53 value to get only 33. Clearly unfavorable.\n\n4. **Leverage**:  \n   You have large stocks of Wheat, Brick, and Ore \u2014 the latter two are high-value. Holding more high-value resources gives you leverage. Player 0 wants Ore and Brick, so avoid giving them away cheaply.\n\n5. **Repeated Interaction**:  \n   The game lasts 10 turns. While trade is possible, you should only accept offers that benefit you. Repeated offers suggest Player 0 may adjust if rejected, so denying bad offers may lead to better ones.\n\n6. **Avoiding Exploitation**:  \n   Player 0\u2019s current offer: give 1 Ore (33 value) \u2192 get 5 Wheat (25) + 2 Sheep (28) = 53 value. That\u2019s a net gain of 20 for *them*. This is highly exploitative. Must reject.\n\n7. **Counter-Strategy Opportunity**:  \n   Since Player 0 values Wheat and is offering Ore, perhaps a revised offer could request more value. For example, offer less Wheat or more Sheep in exchange for Ore and Brick.\n\nDecision:\n\nPlayer 0\u2019s latest offer is heavily skewed against you. Accepting would decrease your total resource value. You should **deny** the offer.\n\nMoreover, to improve negotiation momentum, you should make a reasonable but favorable counter-offer that leverages your surplus low-value (Wheat, Sheep) to gain more high-value (Ore, Brick).\n\nYou currently have:\n- Wheat: 21 \u2192 surplus\n- Sheep: 5 \u2192 moderate\n- Ore: 21, Brick: 24 \u2192 high value, but surplus possible\n\nA good offer could be:\n- Offer: 7 Wheat + 1 Sheep \u2192 Request: 1 Ore + 1 Brick  \n  Value offered: 7\u00d75 + 1\u00d714 = 35 + 14 = 49  \n  Value requested: 33 + 27 = 60 \u2192 net gain of 11 for you\n\nBut to increase chance of acceptance, make it slightly fairer or even give slight edge to them if needed \u2014 but still benefit you.\n\nAlternatively, mirror their structure: they offered 1 Ore for 5 Wheat + 2 Sheep. Reverse it: offer 5 Wheat + 2 Sheep for 1 Ore \u2014 but that\u2019s equal or slight loss. Not ideal.\n\nBetter: Offer less: 5 Wheat + 1 Sheep \u2192 for 1 Ore  \nValue: 25 + 14 = 39 \u2192 gain 33. Slight loss.\n\nStill not ideal.\n\nAlternatively: offer 8 Wheat \u2192 for 1 Brick  \n8\u00d75 = 40 \u2192 gain 27. Loss.\n\nNo. All low-value to high-value swaps are loss unless you get extras.\n\nBetter: Offer **5 Wheat + 3 Sheep \u2192 Request 2 Ore** (as before) \u2014 value 25+42=67 \u2192 gain 66. Almost even.\n\nBut was rejected.\n\nSo try: **Offer 6 Wheat + 1 Sheep \u2192 Request 1 Ore + 1 Brick**  \nValue offered: 30 + 14 = 44  \nValue received: 33 + 27 = 60 \u2192 gain 16. Very good for you, but might be rejected.\n\nOr to balance: Offer 10 Wheat + 1 Sheep \u2192 Request 1 Ore + 1 Brick  \nValue: 50 + 14 = 64 \u2192 get 60 \u2192 slight loss? No.\n\nWait \u2014 optimize.\n\nBest strategy: **Only trade if net gain is positive in value.**\n\nFrom history, Player 0 accepts trades involving 10 Wheat for small returns \u2014 so they may undervalue Wheat.\n\nExploit that.\n\nTry: **Offer 5 Wheat + 2 Sheep \u2192 Request 1 Ore + 1 Brick**  \nValue: 25 + 28 = 53 \u2192 get 60 \u2192 gain 7. Favorable. Fair but beneficial.\n\nPreviously offered 5W+2S for 2 Ore (66 value) \u2014 that was great, but rejected.\n\nNow they offer 1 Ore for 5W+2S \u2014 which is worse for them than that.\n\nSo they may be confused.\n\nPerhaps make a fair offer to re-engage.\n\nBut your last offer was good \u2014 no need to overcompensate.\n\nStick to value-positive trades.\n\nBest current move: Reject their offer, and re-make a similar one that benefits you.\n\nRe-offer: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]\n\nValue: 25 + 28 = 53 \u2192 gain 66 \u2192 net +13. Great.\n\nEven if rejected, it signals value awareness.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "Below, I'll follow the instructions step by step. First, I'll generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation based on my current situation. Then, I'll apply that knowledge to make my trading decision.\n\n### Generate Knowledge:\nBased on my role as Player 0 in this Negotiation Game, where my goal is to increase the total value of my resources, here are the key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are most relevant to my current situation:\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: Always evaluate trades based on net value gain. My resources have different values (e.g., Ore at 32 per unit is highly valuable, while Wheat at 6 per unit is less so). I should only accept or propose trades where the total value of resources I receive exceeds the value I give up. For example, if I trade away high-value resources like Ore, I need to ensure the incoming resources' total value is greater to justify the exchange. This prevents losses and aligns with the game's objective of increasing my overall portfolio value.\n\n2. **Negotiation History and Patterns**: Analyze past interactions to identify opponent preferences and behaviors. From the history, Player 1 has consistently rejected offers involving Wheat and Sheep in exchange for Ore or Brick, indicating they may value Ore highly (as they've proposed multiple trades for it) but are unwilling to part with Brick easily. This suggests I should leverage my abundance of Ore (18 units) as a bargaining chip while avoiding over-giving. Conversely, Player 1 seems to have excess Wheat and Sheep, so I could propose trades that offload my lower-value resources (like Wheat) for higher-value ones, but only if it results in a net gain for me.\n\n3. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: Consider resource scarcity and my own inventory. I have high quantities of Wheat (19), Wood (17), and Ore (18), which gives me leverage in trades involving these. However, I should prioritize acquiring resources that could further increase my value, such as more Brick (value 25) if available, while being cautious not to deplete my high-value Ore too quickly. In negotiations, offering resources the other player wants (e.g., Ore for Player 1) can build goodwill, but I must ensure the trade is asymmetric in my favor to maintain a competitive edge.\n\n4. **Risk Management and Turn Efficiency**: With only 10 turns total, I need to avoid prolonged rejections by making strategic, incremental adjustments to offers rather than sticking to losing proposals. If an offer is rejected, I should counter with a modified version that tests the opponent's limits without sacrificing too much value. Additionally, when responding to incoming offers, default to denial if it's not beneficial, then immediately propose a counteroffer to keep the negotiation active and pressure the opponent.\n\n5. **Fairness and Persuasion**: Trades should appear reasonably fair to the other player to encourage acceptance, but I should aim for a slight edge. For instance, calculate approximate value exchanges and add a small concession (e.g., extra low-value items) to make my offer more appealing. Psychological insights, like reciprocity, suggest that rejecting an offer and immediately proposing a better one for me can signal flexibility while maintaining control.\n\nThese principles are directly applicable given my current resources and the ongoing rejections, where Player 1 is clearly seeking Ore but not offering enough value in return.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Make Trading Decision:\nApplying the above knowledge, I'll first evaluate the incoming offer from Player 1: They are offering 5 Wheat and 2 Sheep in exchange for 2 Ore.\n\n- Value of what they're offering: 5 Wheat (5 \u00d7 6 = 30) + 2 Sheep (2 \u00d7 12 = 24) = Total 54 value.\n- Value of what they're requesting: 2 Ore (2 \u00d7 32 = 64 value).\n- Net result: I would lose 64 - 54 = 10 value, which violates the principle of value maximization. Therefore, this trade is not in my favor, and I must deny it to avoid a loss.\n\nNext, based on negotiation history, Player 1 wants Ore, so I'll propose a counteroffer that leverages my Ore surplus while ensuring I gain value. I'll aim for a net gain by requesting more of their lower-value resources (Wheat and Sheep) in exchange for just 1 Ore. Specifically, I'll offer 1 Ore (worth 32) for 6 Wheat and 1 Sheep, which totals 6 \u00d7 6 = 36 for Wheat + 1 \u00d7 12 = 12 for Sheep = 48 value. This gives me a net gain of 48 - 32 = 16 value, aligning with supply and demand dynamics and turn efficiency.\n\nThus, my decision: [Deny] the incoming offer, then make a new offer.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 6 Wheat, 1 Sheep]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: The total value of a resource is determined by multiplying its quantity by its individual value. Currently, my most valuable resource by unit value is Ore (33), followed by Brick (27), Sheep (14), Wood (11), and Wheat (5). However, high unit value doesn't always mean surplus; I must assess scarcity and utility.\n\n2. **Surplus vs. Scarcity**: I have large quantities of Wheat (21), Brick (24), and Ore (21). Sheep (5) is my scarcest resource by count, but it has a high unit value (14). Trading away low-value surplus (Wheat) for high-value scarce or useful resources (Ore, Brick if needed) is ideal.\n\n3. **Trading Leverage**: Since Wheat has the lowest unit value (5), offering it in bulk can be an effective way to acquire higher-value resources. However, I must avoid trading too much for minimal gain or allowing others to exploit my surplus for their high-value goods.\n\n4. **Trade Efficiency**: A good trade increases total resource value. For example: giving up 5 Wheat (5\u00d75 = 25 total value) and 2 Sheep (2\u00d714 = 28) = 53 value, to get 2 Ore (2\u00d733 = 66) is a net gain of 13\u2014favorable.\n\n5. **Negotiation Dynamics**: Repeated offers suggest Player 0 values Wheat and Sheep and is willing to trade Ore (high-value, possibly abundant for them). Their shift from requesting Brick to requesting Wheat/Sheep indicates flexible strategy. I can exploit this by using Wheat surplus to extract high-value resources.\n\n6. **Pattern Recognition**: Player 0 has flipped the last offer\u2014now offering 1 Ore for 6 Wheat and 1 Sheep. This is worse for me than previous offers (previously 1 Ore for 5 Wheat + 2 Sheep, which was already borderline). Now they offer less Ore for more of my resources\u2014unfavorable.\n\n7. **Strategic Positioning**: My prior offer (5 Wheat + 2 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore) is favorable (53 out, 66 in). I should either repeat it or adjust slightly to increase chance of acceptance while preserving value-gain.\n\n8. **Next Move**: Since Player 0 made a bad offer (1 Ore \u2190 6 Wheat + 1 Sheep = value 33 in, 30+14=44 out \u2192 net loss), I should reject it and re-assert my advantageous offer or slightly improve terms to close the deal.\n\nDecision:  \n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nBased on my current situation in the Negotiation Game, where I aim to maximize the total value of my resources (Wheat: Value 6, Wood: Value 9, Sheep: Value 12, Brick: Value 25, Ore: Value 32), here are the key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are most relevant:\n\n- **Value-Based Trading Principle**: Always evaluate trades based on your personal resource valuations to ensure the net value increases for you. For example, only accept or propose trades where the total value of resources received exceeds the value of resources given. This is crucial in a zero-sum game like this, where resources are finite, and the game only lasts 10 turns.\n\n- **Leverage Scarcity and Opponent's Preferences**: Identify what the other player values most based on their repeated offers. From the history, Player 1 consistently offers Wheat and Sheep in exchange for Ore, indicating they highly value Ore (my most valuable resource at 32 per unit). I can leverage this by demanding more in return for Ore, but I must protect high-value resources like Ore and Brick to avoid devaluing my portfolio.\n\n- **Negotiation Tactics for Limited Turns**: In a short game (only 10 turns), avoid one-sided concessions and persist with adjusted offers to build momentum. If an offer is rejected, make incremental changes to make it more appealing while still benefiting you, such as increasing what you request. However, don't accept unfair deals that result in a net loss, as this wastes turns and reduces your overall advantage.\n\n- **Risk Management Insight**: Be cautious with high-value or abundant resources. I have a surplus of Ore (18 units), but trading it too cheaply could backfire. Analyze past interactions: Player 1 has rejected my offers involving Ore for Wheat and Sheep, suggesting they may have different valuations or resource constraints. Use this to refine offers, aiming for a win-win that still prioritizes my gains.\n\n- **Counteroffer Strategy**: When responding to an incoming offer, if it's not beneficial, deny it and immediately propose a counteroffer that addresses the opponent's interests while maximizing your value. For instance, if they want Ore, counter with an offer that requires them to provide more value in Wheat and Sheep, based on my assessments.\n\nThese principles emphasize calculated decision-making to ensure long-term gains in a competitive setting.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\n\nApplying the generated knowledge to the current situation: Player 1 has offered 5 Wheat and 2 Sheep (total value to me: 5 * 6 = 30 for Wheat + 2 * 12 = 24 for Sheep = 54) in exchange for 2 Ore (total value to me: 2 * 32 = 64). This results in a net loss for me (54 < 64), violating the Value-Based Trading Principle, so I must deny it to protect my resources.\n\nFrom the history, Player 1 repeatedly rejects my Ore-for-Wheat-and-Sheep offers, indicating they may need a slightly sweeter deal or have limitations. Using the Leverage Scarcity and Counteroffer Strategy, I'll deny this offer and propose a new one that builds on their interest in Ore while demanding more value from them (e.g., increasing Wheat to make it worthwhile for me). My proposed offer will involve 1 Ore (to keep it simple and targeted) in exchange for 7 Wheat and 2 Sheep, which provides me a net gain: Received value = 7 * 6 + 2 * 12 = 42 + 24 = 66, minus given value of 1 Ore = 32, for a net gain of 34. This aligns with Risk Management by not overcommitting Ore and fits the game's limited turns by pushing for progress.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 7 Wheat, 2 Sheep]",
