      "response": "Below, I'll follow the instructions step by step. First, I'll generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation based on my current situation. Then, I'll apply that knowledge to make a trading decision, ensuring my goal is to increase the total value of my resources (currently calculated as 1199 based on the given values).\n\n### Generated Knowledge:\nKey principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation relevant to my situation include:\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: The primary goal is to ensure that any trade increases the total value of my resources. This means comparing the combined value of resources I'm offering against the value of resources I'm requesting. I should only proceed with trades where the incoming resources' total value exceeds the outgoing ones, accounting for a margin to offset risks like opportunity cost. In my case, with resources like Wheat (low value at 6 per unit) in high quantity, I can leverage these as \"trade bait\" for higher-value resources like Ore (40 per unit) or Brick (30 per unit).\n\n2. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: I have abundant quantities of certain resources (e.g., 25 Wheat and 15 Ore), which may be less critical to me and more valuable to other players who might be scarce on them. Conversely, I should seek resources that are high-value to me but that I have in limited quantities relative to their worth. Strategies include offering excess low-value resources (like Wheat) to acquire high-value ones, while being mindful that other players will only accept offers that seem fair from their perspective. Over the 10-turn limit, I need to act efficiently to build value early.\n\n3. **Negotiation Principles**: Effective negotiation involves proposing balanced offers to encourage acceptance, such as including a mix of resources that might appeal to the other player. Avoid overly one-sided trades that could lead to denials, as this wastes turns. Key insights include starting with conservative offers (e.g., slight value gains for me) to test the waters, and using information asymmetry\u2014since I don't know the other players' resources, I should prioritize trading away my least valuable assets first. Additionally, in a finite game like this, prioritize quick, positive-value trades over holding out for perfection.\n\n4. **Risk Management and Turn Efficiency**: With only 10 turns, I should avoid speculative or risky offers that might be denied, as each denial defaults to no progress. Focus on diversification if it aligns with value growth, but always prioritize net gains. For instance, if I have high-value resources like Ore, I might protect them unless the trade offers substantial upside.\n\n5. **Fairness and Psychological Factors**: Offers should appear reasonable to encourage counteroffers or acceptance. A good rule is to aim for trades where the value ratio is close to 1:1 or slightly in my favor (e.g., gaining 5-10% more value) to make it palatable. Insights from negotiation games suggest that players are more likely to accept trades that provide them with needed resources, so I should consider what others might value based on common game dynamics.\n\nThese principles guide me to focus on trading my excess low-value resources (e.g., Wheat) for higher-value ones while keeping offers balanced to maximize the chances of success in this limited-turn game.\n\n### Applying Knowledge to Make a Trading Decision:\nBased on the generated knowledge, I assess my current resources and identify opportunities for value growth. My total value is 1199, and I have an abundance of Wheat (value 6, qty 25), which is my lowest-value resource, making it a prime candidate for trading. In contrast, high-value resources like Ore (value 40, qty 15) and Brick (value 30, qty 8) are already strong holdings, so I want to acquire more of these if possible.\n\nApplying the principles:\n- **Value Maximization**: I'll propose a trade where I offer Wheat (low value) in exchange for Brick (high value), ensuring the incoming value exceeds the outgoing. For example, offering 4 Wheat (total value: 4 * 6 = 24) for 1 Brick (value: 30) would net me a gain of 6 value, which aligns with my goal.\n- **Supply and Demand**: Wheat is plentiful for me, so trading it away reduces my excess without hurting me, while gaining Brick could enhance my portfolio.\n- **Negotiation and Risk**: This offer is conservative and balanced (slightly in my favor but not exploitative), increasing the likelihood of acceptance. It adheres to turn efficiency by proposing a simple, straightforward trade.\n- **Overall Strategy**: This trade increases my total value while preserving my other resources, fitting the 10-turn limit.\n\nTherefore, I decide to initiate this trade to boost my value from 1199.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "Below is my response as Player 0 in the Negotiation Game. I will first generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation based on my current situation, as instructed. Then, I will apply that knowledge to make a trading decision. My goal is to increase the total value of my resources by ensuring that any trade I propose results in a net gain in value.\n\n### Generate Knowledge: Key Principles, Strategies, and Insights\nBased on my current resources (Wheat: 25 qty at 6 value each; Wood: 6 qty at 11 value each; Sheep: 11 qty at 13 value each; Brick: 8 qty at 30 value each; Ore: 15 qty at 40 value each), here are the most relevant principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation:\n\n1. **Value Maximization Principle**: The core objective is to trade resources where the total incoming value exceeds the outgoing value. For instance, my resources have varying values (e.g., Ore at 40 is high, while Wheat at 6 is low), so I should prioritize acquiring high-value resources (like Brick or Ore) by offering low-value ones (like Wheat). This ensures a net positive gain in overall portfolio value. Key insight: Calculate the net value of any trade (e.g., if I offer resources worth 20 and receive ones worth 30, that's a +10 gain).\n\n2. **Abundance and Scarcity Strategy**: I have an abundance of certain resources (e.g., 25 Wheat and 15 Ore), which gives me leverage to offer them without depleting my stock. Conversely, I should avoid trading scarce, high-value resources (e.g., only 6 Wood) unless the return is significantly better. Negotiation insight: Use abundant resources as \"bargaining chips\" to entice others, especially if they need them, while protecting your own scarcities. In my case, since my previous offer of 4 Wheat (low value) for 1 Brick (high value) was rejected, I should adjust by offering more of my abundant resources or combining them to make the deal more appealing without overcommitting.\n\n3. **Negotiation Dynamics and Rejection Handling**: Rejections, like the one from Player 1 on my offer, indicate that the proposed trade wasn't valuable enough for them. Strategies include iterating with incremental improvements (e.g., sweetening the offer), understanding potential counterparty needs (e.g., if Player 1 rejected Wheat, they might prefer Sheep or Wood), and avoiding desperation trades. Turn-based insight: With only 10 turns total, I must be efficient\u2014don't waste turns on unviable offers. If no counteroffer is made, take initiative to propose again, but ensure each offer builds on lessons from prior rejections to increase acceptance chances.\n\n4. **Risk Management and Fairness Insight**: Overtrading (e.g., giving away too much) can deplete resources without guaranteed returns, so aim for balanced offers that still favor me. Additionally, consider the game's competitive nature: Players might lowball or reject to gain leverage, so start with offers that provide a slight edge (e.g., 10-20% value advantage for me) and be prepared to deny unfavorable deals. Overall, successful negotiation often involves reciprocity\u2014offer something the other player values while protecting your own interests.\n\nThese principles are directly applicable given my resource imbalance (e.g., excess Wheat) and the recent rejection, emphasizing the need for calculated, adaptive offers.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge to my situation:\n\n- **Value Assessment**: My previous offer (4 Wheat, total value: 4 * 6 = 24) for 1 Brick (value: 30) resulted in a net loss of 6 value, which might explain the rejection\u2014Player 1 likely saw it as unfavorable. To maximize value, I should propose a trade where I gain more than I lose. For example, I could offer a combination of my abundant, lower-value resources (like Wheat) for high-value ones (like Brick), ensuring the net value is positive for me.\n\n- **Abundance Strategy**: I have 25 Wheat, so I can afford to offer more of it. I should also consider adding a small amount of another resource (e.g., Sheep) to make the offer more attractive without risking too much.\n\n- **Negotiation Dynamics**: Since Player 1 rejected my offer and made no counteroffer, I'll initiate a new one, improving on the last by increasing what I offer slightly to test their interest. This keeps me proactive in the limited turns.\n\n- **Risk Management**: I'll calculate the new offer's net value: Aim for incoming value > outgoing value. For instance, offering 5 Wheat (value: 5 * 6 = 30) and 1 Sheep (value: 13) for 1 Brick (value: 30) would result in a net gain of 30 - (30 + 13) = -13, which is still a loss\u2014wait, no, that's incorrect. Actually, for this to work, I need to request something that exceeds what I give. Let me adjust: Offer 6 Wheat (value: 6 * 6 = 36) for 1 Brick (value: 30), which is a net loss again\u2014bad idea. Instead, offer 4 Wheat and 1 Sheep (total outgoing value: 4*6 + 13 = 24 + 13 = 37) for 1 Brick and perhaps something small from them, but since they're not offering, I'll stick to requesting high-value items.\n\nFinal adjusted decision: Offer 5 Wheat (abundant, value: 5*6 = 30) for 1 Brick (value: 30), which is even trade value-wise, but since I have excess Wheat, it's a step toward clearing low-value stock. If they accept, it maintains my resources while potentially leading to future gains. This is a low-risk iteration on my previous offer.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge about Resource Trading and Negotiation\n\nBefore making my trading decision, I'll outline key principles, strategies, and insights relevant to my situation as Player 0. This is based on core concepts of resource trading and negotiation in competitive games like this one, where the goal is to maximize the total value of my resources over 10 turns.\n\n1. **Value Maximization Principle**: Always prioritize trades that result in a net increase in the total value of your resources. Calculate the value of what you're offering versus what you're receiving (e.g., using the given values: Wheat=6, Wood=11, Sheep=13, Brick=30, Ore=40). Avoid trades that decrease your value unless they enable future opportunities. In my case, I have high-value resources like Ore (40) and Brick (30), so I should trade low-value surpluses (e.g., Wheat at 6) for higher-value items to boost my overall portfolio.\n\n2. **Supply and Demand Insight**: Trade your abundant resources for those you lack or that have higher value. I have a large quantity of Wheat (25) and Ore (15), suggesting these are surpluses, while my other resources like Wood (6) and Brick (8) are more limited. However, based on recent history, Player 1 has rejected offers involving Wheat for Brick, indicating they may not value Wheat highly or have their own surpluses. I should adjust by either increasing the quantity offered or diversifying to include moderately valued resources (e.g., Sheep at 13) to make my offer more appealing without overcommitting.\n\n3. **Negotiation Strategies**: \n   - **Escalation and Concession**: If initial offers are rejected, incrementally improve them to show flexibility, but avoid giving away too much value. My previous offers (4 Wheat for 1 Brick, then 5 Wheat for 1 Brick) were rejected, so I need to escalate slightly (e.g., offer more Wheat or add variety) while ensuring I'm still gaining value overall.\n   - **Risk Awareness in Limited Turns**: With only 10 turns total, I must act efficiently. Prolonged rejections could waste turns, so diversify offers if needed, but don't rush into unfavorable deals. For instance, if Player 1 consistently rejects Wheat-for-Brick, try a different resource pair.\n   - **Opponent Analysis**: Infer preferences from rejections. Player 1 rejected two Wheat-for-Brick offers, suggesting they might value Brick highly or prefer other resources. I should propose trades that balance appeal (e.g., offering resources they might need) with my own gains.\n   - **Fairness and Psychology**: Aim for offers where the value exchanged is roughly equal or slightly in my favor to encourage acceptance, but lean towards their potential needs. Overly one-sided offers (like my first one, where I offered 24 value for 30) often get rejected, so make small concessions.\n\n4. **General Trading Insights**: \n   - Diversify offers to reduce stagnation; don't stick to the same trade if it's failing.\n   - Protect high-value resources (e.g., my Ore at 40 value) unless the return is significantly better.\n   - Calculate net value per trade: For example, trading low-value Wheat (6 each) for high-value Brick (30 each) could be beneficial if I can secure it, as it directly increases my total value.\n\nIn summary, my current situation requires balancing persistence with adaptation. I have surpluses in Wheat and should leverage them, but after two rejections, I need to escalate or vary my offer to avoid wasting turns while ensuring any trade increases my total resource value (currently 1,199).\n\n### Application of Knowledge to Trading Decision\n\nApplying the above knowledge, I'll analyze my options and make a decision. My previous offers (4 Wheat for 1 Brick, then 5 Wheat for 1 Brick) were rejected, indicating I need to escalate slightly to make it more appealing. The first offer was undervalued (24 value given for 30 received), and the second was even (30 for 30), yet still rejected\u2014possibly because Player 1 wants more quantity or variety.\n\n- **Net Value Calculation**: If I offer 6 Wheat (6 * 6 = 36 value) for 1 Brick (30 value), I'm giving slightly more value, which could entice acceptance while still allowing me to gain Brick, a high-value resource that could increase my overall portfolio.\n- **Strategic Adjustment**: This escalation shows concession without overcommitting, and it uses my abundant Wheat surplus. If this fails, future turns could involve diversifying to include Sheep or Wood.\n- **Decision Rationale**: This trade aligns with value maximization, as gaining Brick will boost my total value. It also respects the limited turns by not delaying action.\n\nBased on this, I'll make the following offer:\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge: Resource-Trading & Negotiation Insights\n\n1. **Marginal Value vs. Total Value**  \n   - You lose value whenever you trade a high-marginal-value resource for a low-marginal-value one. In your hand: Wheat (5) and Wood (11) are low; Sheep (15) is moderate; Brick (22) and Ore (39) are high. Trading away high-value items should only be done to acquire **even higher marginal gains** or to complete a portfolio with extremely scarce goods.\n\n2. **Scarcity & Liquidity**  \n   - Brick (7 units) is your scarcest resource. You have only 7 Brick and cannot \u201cafford\u201d to give it away for Wheat, which you already hold in abundance (23 units).  \n   - Wheat is over-supplied in your hand (23 units) and Player 0 keeps trying to dump more Wheat onto you. Accepting larger Wheat stacks just lowers your average resource value.\n\n3. **Concentration Risk vs. Diversification**  \n   - Your hand is heavily concentrated in Wheat / Wood / Sheep. Those three together sum to a value of 23\u00d75 + 25\u00d711 + 20\u00d715 = 660 points but are very similar in marginal value. Adding more Wheat only deepens the imbalance rather than diversifying.\n\n4. **Leverage in Negotiation**  \n   - Because Player 0 is desperately offering ever-bigger Wheat bundles (4, 5, now 6 Wheat for 1 Brick), it signals that:  \n     (a) Brick is worth much more to them than Wheat.  \n     (b) You have **higher negotiating power** if you hold scarce resources (Brick, Ore).  \n   - Instead of settling at 6 Wheat : 1 Brick, you can shop this same Brick for **premium** goods.\n\n5. **Upgrade Principle (Ore as King)**  \n   - Ore has the highest unit value (39). In future turns you may be able to convert surplus Sheep/Wood/Wheat into Ore or Brick at favorable exchange rates.  \n   - Doing the reverse (giving away Ore/Brick for Wheat) pushes your portfolio value down significantly.\n\n6. **Symmetry of Rejection Costs**  \n   - Rejecting costs nothing. Accepting poorly-valued offers annihilates net value. It is virtually always better to decline than to take a marginal-loss trade.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to the Decision\n\nIncoming Offer: 6 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick  \n- You currently hold 23 Wheat (value 5) and 7 Brick (value 22). This trade would leave you with  \n  - Wheat +6 \u2192 29 Wheat (5 value each)  \n  - Brick \u20131 \u2192 6 Brick (22 value each)  \n\nNet change: +30 value in, \u201322 value out \u2192 +8 \u201con paper\u201d but only by importing **even more** of your lowest-value resource. That reduces your positional quality (Brick scarcity) and worsens your concentration risk. Additionally, Player 0 just offered 4\u21925\u21926 Wheat; you can likely push higher or switch the currency to Ore without overcommitting.\n\nDecision: Reject.\n\nI will also **initiate no additional trade** this turn because none of my currently over-supplied low-value items (Wheat, Wood) are attractive raw materials to propose away; I want to wait for a better counter-offer or a future pair-up with Ore.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\nBased on my current situation in the Negotiation Game, here are the key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are most relevant:\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: The primary goal is to ensure that any trade increases the total value of my resources. I must calculate the net value gain or loss for every potential trade by comparing the value of resources I offer against the value I receive. For example, my resources have the following per-unit values: Wheat (6), Wood (11), Sheep (13), Brick (30), and Ore (40). A trade should only be made if the incoming value exceeds the outgoing value to avoid diminishing my overall portfolio.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost and Scarcity**: I have abundant Wheat (25 units) but limited high-value resources like Brick (8 units) and Ore (15 units). Trading excess low-value resources (e.g., Wheat) for high-value ones (e.g., Brick) could be beneficial, but I must avoid overtrading scarce items. From the game history, Player 1 has repeatedly rejected my offers of Wheat for Brick, indicating that Wheat may not be desirable to them or that they value Brick highly. This suggests I should diversify my offers to include other resources Player 1 might want, while protecting my high-value assets like Ore.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics and Adaptation**: With only 10 turns total, I need to be efficient and adaptive. My previous offers (e.g., 4, 5, or 6 Wheat for 1 Brick) resulted in net losses (e.g., 6 Wheat = 36 value for 1 Brick = 30 value, a net loss of 6) and were rejected, showing a failed strategy. Effective negotiation involves starting with offers that provide a clear benefit to me while appealing to the other player. I should avoid escalating concessions without reciprocation and instead test new combinations. Insights from negotiation theory suggest using incremental adjustments, but only if they maintain my advantage, and being willing to walk away from unfavorable deals.\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis**: Player 1's consistent rejections of my Wheat-for-Brick offers imply they may not value Wheat or have a surplus of Brick. I should infer their preferences from this and propose trades involving other resources I have in moderate supply, like Sheep or Wood, which might be more appealing. Meanwhile, I need to request high-value resources to maximize my gains.\n\n5. **Risk Management in Limited Turns**: With turns dwindling, I should prioritize trades that offer immediate value gains over risky or speculative ones. If no incoming offer is present, I should proactively make a new offer that aligns with these principles to keep the game moving.\n\n### Trading Decision\nApplying this knowledge, I'll evaluate my options. My previous offers were unprofitable, so I need to propose a trade that ensures a net value gain for me. For instance, offering 2 Sheep (value: 13 each, total 26) for 1 Brick (value: 30) would result in a net gain of 4 value, which aligns with value maximization. This also diversifies from Wheat, potentially appealing to Player 1 based on their rejections.\n\nTherefore, I decide to make the following offer:\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "Knowledge\n\n1. Know your marginal values\u2014not just printed ones.  \n   \u201cValue\u201d here almost certainly means the *marginal* point on the demand curve for each resource given my current holdings. Because my brick stock is low (7) and its listed value is the highest in my hand (22), I value each additional brick *at* or even *above* 22. Conversely, I have plenty of wheat (23) whose value per unit is lowest (5). Treat the printed numbers as shadow prices or opportunity costs, not fixed.\n\n2. Total value increase first, specialize afterward.  \n   My primary objective is to increase \u03a3(quantity * value).  Any trade that gives me items whose value > value given away is strictly profitable.  Do not worry about balancing portfolios until gains stop appearing.\n\n3. Compensate for your surplus / scarcity via asymmetric trades.  \n   I have surplus: Wheat (23), Wood (25), Sheep (20).  \n   I have scarcity: Brick (7), Ore (9).  \n   Therefore I *should be buying* brick and ore, *selling* wheat/wood/sheep.  Player 0 is trying to do the opposite\u2014sell me wheat for brick\u2014which hurts me on both counts.\n\n4. Price fences and sequencing trades.  \n   Even if I value brick at 22, that does not mean I always demand 22 wheat for 1 brick (market-clearing).  I seek trades where the *ratio* of exchanged values beats 1-for-1 by enough margin to make the gain non-trivial for me.\n\n5. Signal willingness to keep offers open.  \n   Since only two players, rejecting every offer ends the game with zero incremental gain.  Instead, counter with *my* surplus-to-scarcity proposals that yield *them* gains while giving *me* more.\n\nDecision\n\nLook for a clear value-improving swap that uses my surplus sheep and/or wood to acquire scarce brick.  Each brick is worth 22.  Each sheep 15, wood 11.\n\nSimple check: Trade 3 sheep (45 value) \u2192 2 brick (44 value) already yields \u20131 value *in raw terms*, but because my final *marginal* value per brick rises as I have more, the first 2 brick may benefit more than raw 44.  More importantly, Player 0 likely values brick *lower*, so we can find a mutual gain zone.  A 3-for-1 brick deal would give me 22\u201345 = \u201323 \u2192 very bad.  A 2-for-1 brick deal using wood would give me 22\u201322 = 0 \u2192 flat.  Must sweeten.\n\nBetter deal: Offer sheep (valued more in P0\u2019s eyes, perhaps) for brick.  \nMy marginal valuation summary:\n - Give away 3 sheep (45 value)  \n - Receive 5 brick (110 value) \u2192 +65 value to me  \n   P0 almost certainly will not swallow that, but we should anchor big.\n\nMore realistic ratio: historical pattern is 4\u20136 wheat : 1 brick (~5\u00d75 = 25 wheat value).  Sheep is 15.  15*1.5 = 22.5 \u2248 brick\u2019s value.  So 1 Sheep for 1 Brick would be neutral *for me* yet P0 gains 21 vs his internal brick value? Unknown.  Since past bids were worse, try \u201c2 sheep \u2192 1 brick\u201d.  I lose 2\u00d715 = 30, gain 22 brick \u2192 \u20138 value *absolute*.  Reject.\n\nCheck next: give wood instead.  Wood 11.  P0 needs wood less; historically their offers kept offering wheat, keep wheat in deal.  Best trade: offer **Sheep + Wood together for brick**, exploiting P0\u2019s apparent wheat preference.  Example:\n\n- Offer 2 sheep (30) + 1 wood (11) = 41 \u2192 2 brick (44) \u2192 net +3 value to me.  Close margin, maybe negotiable, but we are still improving my value and likely acceptable to P0 who values brick lower.\n\nHowever we cannot currently offer a fractional brick\u2014assume indivisible.  So safest clear single-trade +ve delta is **3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick** (45 vs 44) if *P0* values brick < 22 each\u2014probable.  Difference is 1 value risk.\n\nA neater indivisible bundle: I can take back one sheep to balance value better: Offer **3 Sheep + 2 Ore** worth 45+78 = 123, ask **5 Brick + 2 Sheep** worth 110+30 = 140. That is +17 net to me, looks lucrative.\n\nTherefore explicit positive-margin aggressive proposal:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are crucial for maximizing the total value of my resources, especially in a limited-turn game like this one with only 10 turns remaining. Based on my current situation, here are the most relevant insights:\n\n- **Value-Based Trading**: Always evaluate trades based on the personal value of resources to ensure that the net value gained (value of resources received minus value of resources given) is positive. For instance, my resources have specific values (e.g., Wheat at 6, Ore at 40), so I should only accept or propose trades where the incoming resources' total value exceeds the outgoing ones. This prevents losses and aligns with the goal of increasing overall resource value.\n\n- **Negotiation Dynamics**: In a back-and-forth game, rejected offers signal misalignment in perceived value. I should use rejections as opportunities to adjust offers\u2014perhaps by countering with something that better reflects mutual benefits or by emphasizing my abundance in low-value resources (like Wheat) to acquire high-value ones (like Ore). Starting with reasonable concessions can build rapport, but I must avoid over-giving, especially since the game is finite.\n\n- **Scarcity and Opportunity Cost**: Consider the relative abundance of my resources and the game's time limit. I have a surplus of Wheat (low value at 6) and Ore (high value at 40), so trading excess low-value resources for high-value ones is ideal. However, I should be cautious with high-value resources like Brick (30) or Ore, as losing them could hinder future trades. With turns dwindling, prioritize efficient trades over waiting.\n\n- **Risk of Unfavorable Deals**: Reject offers that result in a net value loss, as accepting them could set a precedent for poor negotiations. Instead, counter with offers that favor me while being potentially attractive to the other player, based on their past rejections (e.g., they've consistently rejected Wheat or Sheep for Brick, suggesting they value Brick highly).\n\n- **Strategic Patience and Adaptation**: In a multi-turn game, don't rush into bad deals; use denials to probe for better terms. My past offers (e.g., Wheat for Brick) were overly generous in value terms, so I need to flip this by proposing trades where I gain more value, while observing patterns like Player 1's interest in Brick.\n\nThese principles emphasize calculated, value-driven decisions to ensure long-term gains in a competitive setting.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\n\nApplying the above knowledge to my current situation: Player 1's offer is [Offered items: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> Requested items: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]. This means they want to give me 3 Sheep (value: 3 * 13 = 39) and 2 Ore (value: 2 * 40 = 80), totaling 119 in value, in exchange for 5 Brick (value: 5 * 30 = 150) and 2 Sheep (value: 2 * 13 = 26), totaling 176 in value. The net value change for me would be 119 - 176 = -57, which is a loss. Based on the value-based trading principle, this offer decreases my total resource value, so I must reject it to avoid a poor deal.\n\nAdditionally, Player 1's history of rejecting my offers (e.g., Wheat for Brick) indicates they may undervalue my low-value resources like Wheat. To adapt and negotiate strategically, I'll make a counteroffer that prioritizes trading my abundant, low-value Wheat for their high-value Ore, ensuring a positive net value for me. Specifically, I'll propose offering 5 Wheat (value: 5 * 6 = 30) for 1 Ore (value: 1 * 40 = 40), resulting in a net gain of 10 value. This aligns with scarcity management and gives Player 1 a chance to accept a mutually viable trade.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

First, **value-based trading** is essential: Always evaluate trades based on the net gain in resource value to ensure you're only accepting deals where the total value of resources received exceeds those given up. For instance, calculate the exact value difference using your personal valuations to avoid losses. Second, **resource scarcity and abundance** should guide decisions; trade excess resources (like my abundant Wheat and Ore) for scarcer or higher-value ones (like Brick, which has a high value of 30 per unit for me). Third, **negotiation tactics** involve starting with offers that favor you, being persistent but adaptive\u2014adjust offers based on rejections to find a mutually beneficial point\u2014and avoiding one-sided deals that signal weakness. In a limited-turn game (only 10 turns total), **time pressure** means I should act decisively to build momentum, as prolonged rejections could waste opportunities; aim for reciprocity to encourage future trades. Finally, **risk assessment** is key: Reject unfavorable offers outright and counter with improved proposals to test the other player's limits, while maintaining a balance to prevent alienating them.

Therefore, I will [Deny] this offer to avoid a poor deal.\n\nNext, considering Player 1's repeated interest in Brick and their rejections of my previous offers, I'll make a counteroffer that aligns with scarcity strategies and negotiation tactics. I have plenty of Sheep (11 units) and want to trade them for Brick to increase my overall value. I'll propose trading 3 Sheep (value: 39) for 1 Brick (value: 30), giving me a net gain of 9 value while testing if this adjusted offer appeals to Player 1.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",
