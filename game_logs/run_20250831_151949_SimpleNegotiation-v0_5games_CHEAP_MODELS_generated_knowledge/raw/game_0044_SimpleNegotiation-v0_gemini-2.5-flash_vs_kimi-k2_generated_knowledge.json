      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Understand Value:** My goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I should always aim to trade resources I value less for resources I value more, or trade resources at a favorable exchange rate where the value of what I receive is greater than the value of what I give up.\n2.  **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:** I have large quantities of Wheat (15), Sheep (18), and Wood (10). I have fewer quantities of Brick (6) and Ore (5). Resources I have in abundance are good candidates for trading away, especially if their individual value is lower. Resources I have fewer of, especially those with high value (Ore, Brick), I should be more cautious about trading away unless the return is significant.\n3.  **Individual Resource Values:**\n    *   Wheat: 6 (Low)\n    *   Wood: 11 (Medium-Low)\n    *   Sheep: 12 (Medium-Low)\n    *   Brick: 26 (High)\n    *   Ore: 38 (Very High)\n4.  **Target Resources:** My highest value resources are Ore and Brick. I should prioritize acquiring more of these if possible, or only trading them for an even greater value. Wheat, Wood, and Sheep are good candidates to offer.\n5.  **Proposing Offers:** When making an offer, I should try to frame it such that the other player finds it appealing while still benefiting me. Offering resources I have in abundance for resources I need, especially high-value ones, is a good strategy. I can offer multiple low-value resources for one high-value resource.\n6.  **Avoid Net Loss:** I must ensure that the total value of resources I receive always exceeds the total value of resources I give up. Calculate the value of both sides of any potential trade.\n7.  **Consider Player State (if known):** Although I don't know Player 1's resources yet, thinking about what *they* might want (e.g., if they are low on a specific resource, or want to complete a set) can help formulate appealing offers. Since I don't know their state, my initial offers will be based on my own needs and surpluses.\n8.  **Strategic Small Gains:** Even small positive value trades accumulate over 10 turns. Don't wait for a \"perfect\" trade if several good opportunities arise.\n\nTrading Decision:\nMy goal is to increase total value. I have a lot of low-value resources (Wheat, Sheep). I want more high-value resources (Ore, Brick). Ore is my most valuable resource, Brick is second.\n\nI will try to trade away my abundant, lower-value resources (Wheat, Sheep) for higher-value resources (Brick, Ore).\n\nI have 15 Wheat (Value 6, total 90), 10 Wood (Value 11, total 110), 18 Sheep (Value 12, total 216).\nI have 6 Brick (Value 26, total 156), 5 Ore (Value 38, total 190).\n\nLet's propose trading multiple low-value items for one high-value item.\nOption 1: Trade multiple Wheat for 1 Brick. (e.g., 5 Wheat = 30 value for 1 Brick = 26 value -> bad for me).\nOption 2: Trade multiple Sheep for 1 Brick. (e.g., 2 Sheep = 24 value for 1 Brick = 26 value -> good for me slightly).\nOption 3: Trade multiple resources (e.g., Wheat + Sheep) for 1 Ore.\n\nLet's target Brick first as it's slightly easier to acquire than Ore. I have plenty of Sheep.\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (Value 24) for 1 Brick (Value 26), that's a gain of 2 value. Good.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (Value 36) for 1 Brick (Value 26), that's a loss of 10 value. Bad.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nIf I offer Wheat. How much Wheat for 1 Ore (38)? About 7 Wheat (42 value) is too much. 6 Wheat (36 value) is a slight loss.\nIf I combine: 2 Wood (22 value) + 2 Wheat (12 value) = 34 value. For 1 Ore (38 value). Good.\nThis saves some Sheep. I have 10 Wood, 15 Wheat.\n\nConsider offering a common resource I have a lot of (Sheep) for a valuable one (Ore).\nPerhaps 3 Sheep (36 value) for 1 Ore (38 value). This is a net gain of 2 value. It's a small gain, but still a gain and uses up my abundant sheep.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I should always aim to trade less valuable resources for more valuable ones, or a smaller quantity of high-value resources for a larger quantity of even higher-value resources.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** I need to be keenly aware of the value of each resource.\n    *   Wheat: 6\n    *   Wood: 11\n    *   Sheep: 12\n    *   Brick: 26\n    *   Ore: 38\n3.  **Surplus Identification:** Identify resources I have in abundance that are relatively lower in value, making them good candidates for offering in trades. I currently have a lot of Wheat, Sheep, and Wood. Sheep and Wheat are relatively low value.\n4.  **Deficit Identification:** Identify resources I lack or want more of, especially high-value ones. Ore and Brick are my highest value resources. I only have 6 Brick and 5 Ore.\n5.  **Perceived Value vs. Actual Value:** Other players might value resources differently based on their own needs. This can create opportunities for mutually beneficial trades even if the strict monetary value isn't perfectly balanced. However, my priority is *my* value.\n6.  **Incremental Gains:** Even small value increases per trade add up over 10 turns. Don't wait for a \"perfect\" trade if reasonable value increases are possible.\n7.  **Testing the Waters:** Initial offers can be used to gauge an opponent's willingness to trade and their perceived value of resources.\n8.  **Leverage High-Value Resources (Cautiously):** While I want more Ore and Brick, I can also *offer* a small amount of them if it nets me a significantly higher total value in return (e.g., offering 1 Ore for 2 Brick and something else). However, this is riskier.\n9.  **Current Trade Context:** In the last turn, I successfully traded 3 Sheep (3*12 = 36 value) for 1 Ore (38 value). This was a positive trade, increasing my total value by 2. This confirms other players might value Ore highly.\n10. **Player 1's Acceptance:** Player 1 accepted my previous offer, indicating they were willing to trade Ore. This suggests they might have a surplus of Ore or a strong need for Sheep. I should continue to leverage this if possible.\n\nCurrent Resources and Values after Turn 1:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 15 Value: 6 (Total 90)\n*   [Wood] Qty: 10 Value: 11 (Total 110)\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 15 Value: 12 (Total 180) (Previously 18, traded 3)\n*   [Brick] Qty: 6 Value: 26 (Total 156)\n*   [Ore] Qty: 6 Value: 38 (Total 228) (Previously 5, gained 1)\nTotal Value: 90 + 110 + 180 + 156 + 228 = 764\n\nDecision:\nMy goal is to increase value. Brick (26) and Ore (38) are my highest value resources. Wheat (6), Wood (11), and Sheep (12) are my lowest. I have surpluses in the lower-value resources. I successfully traded Sheep for Ore last turn. I should try to continue converting my low-value resources into high-value ones.\n\nI have 15 Sheep. I could offer Sheep again to try and get more Ore or Brick.\nAn offer of 3 Sheep (36 value) for 1 Ore (38 value) was accepted.\nWhat if I try for Brick?\n3 Sheep (36 value) for 1 Brick (26 value)? No, that's a loss.\n4 Sheep (48 value) for 1 Brick (26 value)? Still a loss.\nI need 3 Brick to break even with 4 Sheep (4*12 = 48 vs 3*26 = 78). This is too much to ask as they would lose value.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, since Player 1 was willing to give it up.\nI will offer 3 Sheep (36 value) again in exchange for 1 Ore (38 value). This is a consistent offer from last turn, which was accepted, and gives me a small value gain. If they have more Ore to spare, this is a good trade.\nAlternatively, I could try to get a higher quantity of low-value resources if they are trading for something I don't need or have in abundance. But my goal is *value*.\n\nConsider trading Wood. I have 10 Wood (value 11).\n3 Wood (33 value) for 1 Ore (38 value)? This is a slightly bigger gain for me (5 value vs 2 value for Sheep trade). And Wood is my second lowest value resource. It also leaves my Sheep untouched, which are abundant.\n\nLet's try: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

This gains me 8 value.\nOr perhaps: 6 Wheat (6 * 6 = 36 value) for 1 Ore (38 value). This gains me 2 value. This is a very close trade, more likely to be accepted.\n\nI also have a lot of Sheep. Let's try combining Sheep and Wood.\nOffer: 2 Wood (22 value) + 2 Sheep (24 value) = 46 value for 1 Ore (38 value). This is a loss of value for me. No.\n\nLet's refine the previous successful trade: 3 Sheep (36) for 1 Ore (38). Player 1 accepted.\nI still have 15 Sheep. I can try this again.\n\nLet's try trading Wheat for Brick.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (30 value) for 1 Brick (26 value). This is a loss for me. No.\nOffer: 3 Wheat (18 value) for 1 Brick (26 value). This would be an 8 value gain! This is worth trying.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again. Last unsuccessful was 3 Wood for 1 Ore.\nWhat if I offer 4 Wood (44 value) for 1 Ore (38 value)? It's a loss for me.\nWhat if I offer 2 Wood + 2 Sheep for 1 Ore? That's 22 + 24 = 46 value for 38 value, still a loss.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep. The first trade was good. Let's try to repeat it.\n\nLet's try a small quantity of low-value resources for one high-value resource.\nOffer: 3 Wheat (18 val) for 1 Brick (26 val). Gain +8 val.\nOffer: 4 Wheat (24 val) for 1 Brick (26 val). Gain +2 val. This looks more reasonable for the opponent.\n\nLet's go for the 4 Wheat for 1 Brick. It's a good gain for me, and Brick is high value.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

They are requesting 3 Brick (3 * 26 = 78 total value). This is a highly unfavorable trade for me (34 received for 78 given up).

I need to offer more attractive bundles of my low-value resources for their high-value ones.\n\nTrading Decision:\nThe offer from Player 1 is to trade 2 Wheat and 2 Wood (value 34) for 3 Brick (value 78).

Market Behaviour Observed in this game  \n   - Player 0 is willing to accept Sheep \u2192 Ore 3:1 (already accepted once), showing Ore is over-valued by P0.  \n   - Player 0 is NOT willing to accept 4W\u21921B or 2W+2Wo\u21923B, so P0 is price-insensitive for Brick.  \n   - P0 previously offered 3 Wood\u21921 Ore (ratio 27:32) suggesting P0 undervalues Ore \u2264 32 in their eyes.\n\n4. Opportunity to Exploit  \n   - I have 23 Wheat and 24 Wood\u2014both large piles of lowest-value cards that are hard to move directly for Brick/Ore.  \n   - Sheep are medium value, but P0 likes them and will give Ore.  \n   - Ore has the single highest value for me, any trade that turns lower-value resources into Ore is profitable as long as Ore stays \u2265 the resource given away.\n\nDecision Steps:\n\n- Value-gaining move: exchange resources rated < 32 into Ore (32) or Brick (30).  \n- I still have 10 Sheep.  Giving \u2264 6 Sheep would not put me below 4, which is a safe surplus for most purposes.  \n- P0 has already accepted 3 Sheep\u21921 Ore once. Re-offering the same should again clear the profit threshold since 3\u00b718 < 32. Additional low-value cards, even if P0 rejects, do not hurt.\n\nHence structure an offer that swaps the cheapest possible low-value package for Ore/Brick.\n\nChosen Offer:\nGive Player 0: 4 Wheat (value 4\u00b76 = 24)  \nGet from Player 0: 1 Ore (value 32).  \n\nNet gain for me = +8 value.  \nPlayer 0 previously rejected 4 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick (-6 vs their last proposal) but the ore-specific valuation was acceptable in sheep form; proposing the same ratio in Wheat may still work and tries the cheapest path first, without dipping into Sheep.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

They can always counter or deny.\n6.  **Learn from Past Interactions:**\n    *   Player 1 *accepted* 3 Sheep (36 value) for 1 Ore (38 value), which was a good trade for me (+2 value).\n    *   Player 1 *rejected* 3 Wood (33 value) for 1 Ore (38 value). This indicates Player 1 values Wood more relatively or doesn't want to give up Ore for that amount of Wood.\n    *   Player 1 *rejected* 4 Wheat (24 value) for 1 Brick (26 value). This was a very minor gain for me (+2 value). Player 1 likely finds 4 Wheat too little.\n    *   Player 1 *offered* 2 Wheat (12) + 2 Wood (22) = 34 value for 3 Brick (78 value). This was a terrible offer for me (-44 value) and was correctly rejected.\n    *   Player 1 *offered* 4 Wheat (24) for 1 Ore (38). This was a good offer for me (+14 value) and I *rejected* it. This was an error. I need to be more careful.\n    *   Player 1 *offered* 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (38). This is also a good offer for me (+8 value).\n\n7.  **Re-evaluate Strategy based on Mistake:** I just made a mistake by rejecting 4 Wheat for 1 Ore. I must be more diligent in calculating values quickly and recognizing good deals. Player 1 seems willing to trade Ore for Wheat, which is highly beneficial for me.\n\nMy current resources:\nWheat: 15 (Value 6) -> 90 total value\nWood: 10 (Value 11) -> 110 total value\nSheep: 18 (Value 12) -> 216 total value\nBrick: 6 (Value 26) -> 156 total value\nOre: 5 (Value 38) -> 190 total value\nTotal Value: 762\n\nPlayer 1's last offer was 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (38). This is a net gain of 8 value for me. I should accept this.\n\n[Accept]",
