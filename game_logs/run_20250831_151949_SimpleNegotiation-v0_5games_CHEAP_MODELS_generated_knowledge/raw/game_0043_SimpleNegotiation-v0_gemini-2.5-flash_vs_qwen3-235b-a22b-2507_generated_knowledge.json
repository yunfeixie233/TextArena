      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1.  **Objective:** The primary goal is to increase the *total value* of my resources. This means not just accumulating more resources, but acquiring resources that are more valuable to me than what I give away.\n2.  **Resource Values:**\n    *   Wheat: 5 (Low)\n    *   Wood: 9 (Medium-low)\n    *   Sheep: 17 (Medium)\n    *   Brick: 26 (High)\n    *   Ore: 38 (Very High)\n    This hierarchy is crucial. I want to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n3.  **Current Inventory Analysis:**\n    *   Wheat (23): Abundant, lowest value. Good candidate for giving away.\n    *   Wood (7): Moderate quantity, low value. Also a good candidate for giving away.\n    *   Sheep (13): Good quantity, medium value. Can be used strategically, but less eager to give away than Wheat/Wood.\n    *   Brick (8): Moderate quantity, high value. Less eager to give away.\n    *   Ore (7): Moderate quantity, very high value. Highly reluctant to give away.\n4.  **Trading Ratios/Profitability:** A profitable trade involves `Value(Requested Resources) > Value(Offered Resources)`. The greater the difference, the more profitable.\n    *   Example: Trading 1 Wheat (5) for 1 Brick (26) is highly profitable (+21).\n    *   Example: Trading 3 Wheat (15) for 1 Brick (26) is profitable (+11).\n    *   Avoid trades where `Value(Requested Resources) <= Value(Offered Resources)`.\n5.  **Perceived Value vs. Actual Value:** Other players might value resources differently based on their needs, even if my intrinsic value is fixed. This creates opportunities for mutually beneficial trades where both players increase *their own* total value.\n6.  **Scarcity/Abundance:** My abundant low-value resources (Wheat) are prime candidates to offer. My scarce high-value resources (Ore) are what I want to acquire or retain.\n7.  **Initial Strategy - Offering:**\n    *   Prioritize offering Wheat and Wood, especially in larger quantities, to acquire higher-value resources.\n    *   Seek to acquire Brick and Ore. Sheep can be considered if the deal is highly favorable.\n    *   Aim for significant value increases per trade. Small increments are okay, but large ones are better.\n8.  **Negotiation - Player 0 Advantage:** As the first player, I set the tone. I should make a reasonable offer that clearly benefits me but might also appeal to another player if they need what I'm offering. Avoid overly greedy initial offers that might shut down negotiation.\n9.  **Look for \"Junk for Treasure\" trades:** Leverage my low-value abundance to get high-value scarcity.\n\nMy current total value is (23*5) + (7*9) + (13*17) + (8*26) + (7*38) = 115 + 63 + 221 + 208 + 266 = 873.\n\nTrading Decision:\n\nI have a large quantity of Wheat (23) which has the lowest value (5). I want to acquire high-value resources like Ore (38) or Brick (26). I have 7 Ore, but it's very valuable, so I shouldn't give it away. I have 8 Brick, which is also valuable.\n\nLet's try to convert my abundant low-value Wheat into higher-value resources.\nI will offer a significant amount of Wheat for a high-value resource, aiming for a clear value increase.\n\nConsider giving 5 Wheat (5 * 5 = 25 value) for 1 Brick (26 value). This is a slight gain (+1), but I have so much Wheat.\nConsider giving 6 Wheat (6 * 5 = 30 value) for 1 Brick (26 value). This is a loss (-4). Not good.\nConsider giving 5-6 Wheat for 1 Sheep (17 value). This is a loss.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix, or target a more significant item like Ore?\nOffering a large amount of Wheat for Ore might be too much to ask.\n\nLet's try to trade a slightly more valuable resource like Sheep, combined with something else, to get an even higher value resource.\nI have 13 Sheep (17 value).\n\nHow about trading a lot of Wheat and some Wood for Brick or Ore?\nLet's calculate: 10 Wheat (50 value) + 2 Wood (18 value) = 68 value.\nWhat could I get for 68 value?\n2 Brick (52 value) - loss.\n1 Ore (38 value) - loss.\n1 Ore + 1 Sheep (38+17=55 value) - loss.\n1 Ore + 1 Brick (38+26=64 value) - slight loss, but good resources. I don't want to lose value.\n\nI want to make a trade that is clearly beneficial to me. I need to get resources whose value sum is greater than the value sum of resources I give away.\n\nLet's stick to offering cheap resources (Wheat, Wood) for expensive ones (Brick, Ore).\nMy ideal target is Ore (38).\nCan I get 1 Ore for 8 Wheat? (8 * 5 = 40 value). This is a small loss for me (-2).\nCan I get 1 Ore for 7 Wheat? (7 * 5 = 35 value). This is profitable for me (+3).\nThis is a reasonable offer that might be accepted if the other player needs Wheat and has surplus Ore.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "[Deny]  \n\n**Generate Knowledge:**\n\n1. **Resource Scarcity and Value Differential**: In resource negotiation games, the most profitable trades involve exchanging low-value or surplus resources for high-value or scarce ones. My current inventory shows:\n   - **Ore** (Value: 38) is the most valuable resource I possess, and I have a substantial quantity (20). However, giving it away should only be done in exchange for even greater value.\n   - **Brick** (Value: 23) is high-value and I already have a large surplus (24), so acquiring more should be low priority unless trading away something less useful.\n   - **Sheep** (Value: 18) and **Wood** (Value: 8) are mid-to-low value; I have moderate Sheep (5) and decent Wood (13).\n   - **Wheat** (Value: 6) is the lowest valued resource I hold, and I have a large amount (14)\u2014this makes Wheat ideal for trading away.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost**: Trading away a high-value resource like Ore for a low-value resource like Wheat is highly unfavorable. Player 0 is offering 7 Wheat (7 \u00d7 6 = 42 value) for 1 Ore (38 value). While the total value is nearly even, I already have a large quantity of Wheat (14), so acquiring more provides diminishing returns. Additionally, Ore is more versatile and valuable in most systems.\n\n3. **Trade Efficiency and Gain**: A good trade should increase total value or improve resource balance without sacrificing strategic reserves. Accepting this offer would result in:\n   - Gain: +7 Wheat \u2192 I\u2019d have 21 Wheat (very low value per unit)\n   - Loss: -1 Ore \u2192 Down to 19 Ore\n   - Net value change: +(7\u00d76) = +42, -(1\u00d738) = -38 \u2192 Net +4\n   - But: Wheat is low-value and I already have surplus. Even with marginal gain, the trade is not strategically sound.\n\n4. **Negotiation Leverage**: Since I hold large quantities of high-value Ore and Brick, I should aim to use lower-value resources (like Wheat and possibly Sheep) to trade for higher-value gains or balanced needs. I should **make offers on my own terms**, not accept suboptimal incoming ones.\n\n5. **Future Trade Potential**: By holding onto Ore, I maintain high-value trade leverage for future turns. Giving it away cheaply now limits strategic options later.\n\n**Conclusion**: The offer undervalues my Ore and overloads me with a low-value, already abundant resource (Wheat). It provides minimal net value gain and poor strategic benefit.\n\n**Decision**: [Deny]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Objective Function:** My primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means evaluating trades not just by quantity, but by the net change in value.\n2.  **Resource Values:** I have a clear understanding of the value of each resource. Ore (38) and Brick (26) are my highest value resources. Wheat (5) and Wood (9) are my lowest. Sheep (17) is in the middle.\n3.  **Surplus Analysis:** I have a significant surplus of Wheat (23) compared to other resources. Wheat is also my lowest value resource. This makes Wheat an ideal resource to offer in trades, especially for higher-value items.\n4.  **Deficit/High-Value Resource Acquisition:** I have relatively fewer quantities of Ore (7) and Wood (7). While Wood is low value, Ore is my highest. Acquiring more Ore, Brick, or Sheep would be beneficial.\n5.  **Trading Ratios:** The previous offer (7 Wheat for 1 Ore) was rejected. This suggests Player 1 did not see enough value in 7 Wheat for their 1 Ore, or perhaps they valued their Ore more than my implicit 7:1 ratio (7*5 = 35 value offered for 1*38 = 38 value requested, a slight deficit for me, but good for them if they had surplus Ore). I need to re-evaluate what an attractive offer looks like for Player 1, possibly offering more Wheat or a combination of lower-value resources for a single higher-value resource.\n6.  **Information Asymmetry:** I don't know Player 1's resource quantities or values. I must make educated guesses about what might be valuable to them, or what they might have in surplus. Given the rejection, they likely either didn't need Wheat, or valued their Ore too highly to exchange for 7 Wheat.\n7.  **Strategic Offering:** I should aim to offer resources I have in surplus or low value for resources I have less of or higher value. Small, incremental gains are good. Large, lopsided trades are unlikely to be accepted unless they are extremely favorable to the other party.\n8.  **Patience and Persistence:** The game lasts 10 turns. A rejection doesn't mean the strategy is wrong, just that the specific offer was unappealing. I can modify it or try a different approach.\n\nApply Knowledge:\nGiven the previous rejection of 7 Wheat for 1 Ore (value offered 35, value requested 38), Player 1 either needs more value for their Ore or doesn't need Wheat. I still wish to acquire high-value resources. I have a large surplus of Wheat, which is my lowest value resource. I also have a decent amount of Sheep and Wood.\n\nI will try to offer more Wheat, as it is my most available and lowest value resource. I will increase the amount of Wheat offered to make the trade more appealing for a high-value resource. Alternatively, I could try to get a different high-value resource like Brick. Brick is valuable (26) and I have less of it than Wheat or Sheep.\n\nLet's consider offering a larger amount of Wheat for Brick, which is slightly less valuable than Ore but still a good target for me. Or, I could try to get Sheep.\n\nOption 1: More Wheat for Ore. If 7 Wheat (35 value) wasn't enough, perhaps 8 or 9 Wheat would be (40 or 45 value)? This is still excellent for me as I convert cheap, abundant resources into expensive, scarce ones.\nOption 2: Wheat for Brick. Brick is 26 value. 5-6 Wheat (25-30 value) for 1 Brick seems reasonable.\nOption 3: Wheat for Sheep. Sheep is 17 value. 4 Wheat (20 value) for 1 Sheep.\n\nI still want Ore, but maybe I need to offer more aggressively for it, or offer something else in conjunction with Wheat. What if I offer a mix of lower-value resources?\nI have 23 Wheat (value 5) and 13 Sheep (value 17). Even 1 Sheep is more valuable than 3 Wheat.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again, as it's the highest value. I will increase my offer of Wheat.\nIf I offer 9 Wheat (value 45) for 1 Ore (value 38), it's a net loss of 7 value for me, but it liquidates a large quantity of a low value resource into a high-value, scarce resource. This could be a good long-term strategy if I can then use the Ore to gain profits elsewhere or for production. However, my primary goal is *increasing* total value.\n\nLet's redefine the objective: obtain a net *positive* value trade, or at least a minimal net negative if it leads to better future trades.\nPrevious offer: 7 Wheat (35) for 1 Ore (38). Net gain for Player 1: 3. Net loss for me: 3. Player 1 rejected. This implies 3 value gain was not enough for them, or they don't want Wheat.\n\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (34 value) for 1 Ore (38 value), it's -4 for me. If I offer 3 Sheep (51 value) for 1 Ore, it's +13 for Player 1, and -13 for me. Not good.\n\nPerhaps I can offer a smaller amount of a higher value resource that I still have in surplus (e.g., Sheep) for a different higher-value resource (e.g., Brick).\nI have 13 Sheep, value 17. I have 8 Brick, value 26.\nIf I offer 1 Sheep (17) for 1 Brick (26), Player 1 would gain 9 value, and I'd gain 9 value. This is a very good trade for me, assuming Player 1 has a surplus of Brick and needs Sheep.\n\nLet's test this value-positive trade for *me*.\nMy current total value: 23*5 + 7*9 + 13*17 + 8*26 + 7*38 = 115 + 63 + 221 + 208 + 266 = 873\n\nIf I trade 1 Sheep (17) for 1 Brick (26):\nResources after trade: Wheat (23), Wood (7), Sheep (12), Brick (9), Ore (7)\nNew total value: 23*5 + 7*9 + 12*17 + 9*26 + 7*38 = 115 + 63 + 204 + 234 + 266 = 882.\nNet gain: 9. This is excellent.\n\nI'll try this. It improves my valuation and offers Player 1 a clear value gain if they have surplus Brick.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This means I should aim to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or acquire resources I need more cheaply than I could through other means (though direct acquisition isn't explicitly an option here).\n2.  **Resource Values:** My current resources have different values: Wheat (5), Wood (9), Sheep (17), Brick (26), Ore (38). Ore is the most valuable, Wheat is the least.\n3.  **Past Trades Analysis:**\n    *   `7 Wheat -> 1 Ore`: This was a good attempt given Wheat's low value relative to Ore's high value. Player 1 rejected it, likely finding 7 Wheat insufficient for 1 Ore (7 * 5 = 35 value offered vs. 1 * 38 = 38 value requested). It was close in value, so perhaps 8 Wheat or a combination with a slightly higher value resource would be better.\n    *   `1 Sheep -> 1 Brick`: This trade was `1 * 17 = 17 value offered` vs. `1 * 26 = 26 value requested`. This was a net gain for me if accepted, but Player 1 rejected it. This suggests Player 1 is not looking to give up Brick for Sheep at a 1:1 ratio, or they value Brick more highly for their own needs.\n4.  **Opponent (Player 1) Behavior:** Player 1 has consistently rejected my offers and has not made any counter-offers. This implies they are either very particular about their trades, or they are waiting for me to make a more favorable offer *to them*. They might also be valuing resources differently, or have different needs/priorities.\n5.  **Trading Strategy:**\n    *   **Value Arbitrage:** Look for opportunities where I can give up a resource (or combination) whose total value is less than the value of the resource(s) I receive.\n    *   **Resource Necessity:** Consider that specific resources might have higher utility for Player 1, making them more willing to trade for them, even if the strict monetary value isn't ideal for them. Currently, I don't know Player 1's inventory or needs.\n    *   **Initial Offers:** My previous offers have been rejected. I need to make an offer that is either more attractive to Player 1 (offering more value, or resources they clearly need) or reduce my expectations for the gained resource slightly to get a trade through.\n    *   **Negotiation:** Since Player 1 isn't counter-offering, I need to continue to propose trades and refine my understanding of their willingness.\n    *   **Resource Abundance:** I have the most Wheat (23), followed by Sheep (13), Brick (8), Wood (7), and Ore (7). I can afford to offer more Wheat or Sheep than other resources.\n    *   **Goal:** My goal is to increase my total value. Acquiring more Ore or Brick is generally good. Reducing surplus of low-value items like Wheat is also good, if I can get something higher in return.\n\nApplication of Knowledge:\nGiven that my previous offers were rejected and Player 1 is not counter-offering, I need to adjust my strategy. My offer of 7 Wheat for 1 Ore was close in value, but rejected. My offer of 1 Sheep for 1 Brick was a good deal for me, but rejected by Player 1, indicating they value Brick highly.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat. I want more Ore or Brick. If 7 Wheat (35 value) wasn't enough for 1 Ore (38 value), maybe 8 Wheat or a combination is better. However, Wheat is low value, and offering even more of it might still not be appealing if Player 1 has a lot or doesn't need it.\n\nLet's reconsider the Sheep for Brick trade. Player 1 didn't accept 1 Sheep (17) for 1 Brick (26). This means they want more than 17 value from me for their 26 value Brick piece, or they simply don't want Sheep.\n\nI still have a lot of Wheat. Let's try combining a lower value resource with a medium value resource to get a high value one. Ore is the most valuable and I only have 7. I have a lot of Sheep. Perhaps I can offer a package that is slightly more favorable to Player 1, or at least break even, while still improving my overall resource distribution.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again, as it's the highest value. Maybe Player 1 needs Wood? I only have 7 Wood, so I'm hesitant to give it away, but if it facilitates a good trade for Ore, it could be worth it.\n\nWhat if I try for 1 Ore, and offer something that slightly exceeds the value?\nCurrent target: 1 Ore (38 value).\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (34 value), it's close. Maybe 2 Sheep and 1 Wood? (34 + 9 = 43 value). This is a slight overpay by value, but if Player 1 needs Wood or Sheep, it might work, and 1 Ore is a significant gain for me. My Sheep count is healthy (13). My Wood count is low (7), so I need to be careful with Wood.\n\nLet's try to get another Brick, since I have 8 and it's a good mid-high value resource. I have a lot of Wheat still. What if I offer a significant amount of Wheat for a single higher-value item?\nTarget: 1 Brick (26 value).\nOffer: 5 Wheat (25 value) - too low.\nOffer: 6 Wheat (30 value) - slight overpay by 4 value. Seems plausible for Player 1 to accept. I have 23 Wheat, so giving up 6 is fine. This also reduces my lowest value resource. This is a very simple trade.\n\nLast attempt was 1 Sheep for 1 Brick, which was (17 value for 26 value). Player 1 rejected.\nNow, 6 Wheat for 1 Brick is (30 value for 26 value). I'm offering more value to get the Brick now. This might be more appealing to Player 1.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

High-value resources are generally more desirable, but scarcity and opportunity cost matter.\n- **Opportunity Cost & Surplus Management**: Evaluate whether holding onto a resource has higher expected future value than trading it now. Resources in surplus (relative to your needs or market demand) can be traded at favorable terms.\n- **Trade Leverage**: Players lacking critical resources have less negotiating power. Since Brick and Ore are high-value, others may seek them, giving me leverage to demand better terms.\n- **Incremental Value vs. Marginal Utility**: While Brick and Ore are high-value, I have 24 Brick and 20 Ore\u2014potentially more than immediate use. Trading excess high-quantity high-value resources for mid-tier ones with growth potential (e.g. Sheep, which are high per-unit value but I only have 5) may increase total portfolio value.\n- **Counterparty Incentives**: Player 0 is repeatedly offering Wheat (low value, likely abundant for them) for Brick or Ore. This suggests they need Brick/Ore for development and may be willing to offer more favorable trades.\n- **Trade Efficiency**: Aim for trades that maximize value-in, minimize value-out. Use the formula: (Value of Gained Resources) > (Value of Given Resources).\n- **Strategic Offers**: Instead of rejecting passively, make an aggressive but rational offer that improves my holdings\u2014especially increasing Sheep and possibly Wood, which have room for value growth.\n\nApplication to Current Situation:\n\nPlayer 0 just offered: 6 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick  \nValue Out: 6 \u00d7 6 = 36  \nValue In: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23  \nThis is a bad deal for me\u2014I lose value. Deny.\n\nHowever, I can leverage their apparent need for Brick or Ore to make my own offer. I have surplus Brick (24) and Ore (20)\u2014I can afford to trade some if I gain higher relative value.\n\nBest targets:\n- Acquire more Sheep (only 5, value 18)\u2014they are valuable and I\u2019m low.\n- Acquire Wood (13, value 8)\u2014moderate value, usable, but not urgent.\n- Wheat is low value; only accept in large quantities if giving minimal surplus Brick/Ore.\n\nI should make an offer that:\n- Gives a small amount of low-priority surplus (e.g., Wheat or Brick)\n- Gains higher-value or scarce resources (e.g., Sheep)\n\nBut I control the offer\u2014so reverse the inefficiency: make them give high volume/value for a single unit of Brick or Ore.\n\nIdea: They want Brick. I can offer 1 Brick in exchange for multiple Sheep or a bundle of high-value items.\n\nBut I have 24 Brick\u2014excess. Trading 1 Brick is low cost.\n\nSheep are 18 value, Brick is 23. So for 1 Brick, I should expect >18 value in return.\n\nLet\u2019s propose: 1 Brick \u2192 1 Sheep + some Wheat (to make up value difference)\n\nBut better: aim for 2 Sheep \u2192 give 2 Brick? That would be value 44 \u2192 46, barely net gain.\n\nAlternatively: since they keep offering Wheat for Brick, I can demand a better rate.\n\nTry: Offer 5 Brick \u2192 Request 2 Sheep and 2 Wood  \nValue Given: 5 \u00d7 23 = 115  \nValue Received: (2 \u00d7 18) + (2 \u00d7 8) = 36 + 16 = 52 \u2192 Bad, I lose.\n\nReverse: Offer something low: use Wheat.\n\nI have 14 Wheat\u2014low value, but can be bundled.\n\nOffer: 7 Wheat + 1 Brick \u2192 Request 1 Sheep?  \nValue Out: 7\u00d76 + 1\u00d723 = 42 + 23 = 65  \nValue In: 1\u00d718 = 18 \u2192 No, poor.\n\nBetter: exploit their demand. I have Brick. They want it. So make them pay in high-value items.\n\nBest offer: Offer 3 Brick \u2192 Request 1 Sheep and 1 Ore  \nWait, Ore is 38\u2014very high value. Unlikely.\n\nBut I *have* 20 Ore\u2014why request it? Not useful.\n\nBetter: I need *Sheep*. So focus on getting Sheep.\n\nIdea: Offer 5 Brick \u2192 Request 3 Sheep  \nValue Out: 5\u00d723 = 115  \nValue In: 3\u00d718 = 54 \u2192 Still bad.\n\nThis is hard\u2014Sheep are valuable but I can\u2019t afford to trade Brick for them directly.\n\nAlternative: trade down smartly\u2014use low-value Wheat to get something.\n\nBut Wheat is worth little. Can I get Wood or Sheep in volume?\n\nPerhaps: Offer 10 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 Request 1 Sheep  \nValue: Out = 60 + 8 = 68, In = 18 \u2192 No.\n\nSo direct trades for Sheep are inefficient.\n\nWait\u2014maybe Player 0 has excess Sheep? Their offers don\u2019t show that.\n\nThey offered 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick earlier. So they have at least 1 Sheep.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t repeat it\u2014maybe low on Sheep.\n\nPerhaps I should wait, but I must act.\n\nBetter insight: make a deal where I give *just enough* high-value item to gain multiple low-cost, high-value returns.\n\nBut since I have surplus Brick, and Brick is high-value, I can use it as currency.\n\nOptimal Strategy: **Offer a small amount of Brick for a bundle that includes a higher total value of lower-tier but useful resources, especially targeting imbalance.**\n\nBut math must work: I need (value in) > (value out).\n\nI have 13 Wood\u2014could I trade for Sheep?\n\nAnother idea: **Reverse leverage.** Player 0 is low on Brick (keeps asking). I have 24\u2014very high. I can *require* high-value return.\n\nFinal Plan:\n\nOffer: 3 Brick \u2192 Request 1 Sheep and 2 Wood\n\n- Value Out: 3\u00d723 = 69\n- Value In: (1\u00d718) + (2\u00d78) = 18 + 16 = 34 \u2192 Still negative.\n\nNot working.\n\nWait\u2014what if I **request more**? Try:\n\nOffer: 1 Sheep \u2192 Request: 2 Brick\n\n- Value Out: 18\n- Value In: 46 \u2192 Net +28\n\nYes! That\u2019s smart. I have only 5 Sheep, but giving 1 to get 2 Brick (from 24 to 26) is +23\u00d72 = +46 value, minus 18 = +28 net.\n\nAnd Brick is already my highest-quantity high-value item\u2014converting Sheep into more Brick increases total value.\n\nEven better: Brick value is high, so stacking more is good.\n\nSimilar: Offer 1 Wood \u2192 Request 1 Brick? Value out 8, in 23? But Wood is 13\u2014I have more than Sheep.\n\nBut better to trade highest ratio.\n\nBest value ratio: give Wood or Wheat for Brick.\n\nBut Wheat is too low.\n\nSo: Offer 2 Wood \u2192 Request 1 Brick\n\n- Value: 16 \u2192 23, +7\n\nGood.\n\nBut better: use Sheep? No\u2014Sheep are 18, Brick 23\u2014so 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick is +5, but I\u2019d lose one Sheep.\n\nBut if I do 1 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick: +46 -18 = +28 \u2014 excellent.\n\nCan I justify that? Player 0 previously offered 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick, showing they value 1 Sheep = 1 Brick.\n\nSo 1 Sheep for 2 Brick is generous *to them*, but wait\u2014no: they offered 1 Sheep *for* 1 Brick\u2014meaning they were *giving* Sheep to *get* Brick.\n\nSo they see 1 Sheep as worth at least 1 Brick.\n\nTherefore, offering 1 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick might be seen as a bargain for me, but in value terms, it\u2019s attractive.\n\nBut if they are willing to trade 1 Sheep for 1 Brick, they won't accept giving 2 Brick for 1 Sheep.\n\nSo reverse is unlikely.\n\nBut perhaps offer: 3 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Brick\n\n- Value: 18 + 8 = 26 \u2192 23 \u2192 tiny loss.\n\nClose.\n\nBetter: 2 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Brick = 12+8=20 \u2192 23, +3 \u2014 acceptable.\n\nBut minimal.\n\nSince I have lots of Brick, maybe I should *sell* Brick for Ore? But I already have 20 Ore\u2014Ore is max value.\n\nOre (38) is highest value\u2014do I want more?\n\nIf I can get Ore cheap, yes.\n\nPlayer 0 hasn\u2019t offered any Ore.\n\nEarlier they offered 7 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore \u2014 I denied, but that was good for them.\n\nWait\u2014that was their offer *to me*: they give 7 Wheat, want 1 Ore.\n\nValue: I give 38 (Ore), get 42 (Wheat) \u2014 net +4? Wait.\n\n7 Wheat = 7\u00d76 = 42 value\n1 Ore = 38\n\nSo if I accept: I gain 42, lose 38, net +4 \u2014 a small win.\n\nBut I did deny it.\n\nBut now, I can make a similar offer.\n\nBut I want to increase value\u2014so better to gain high-value items.\n\nAlternatively, I can offer: 2 Brick \u2192 Request 1 Ore\n\n- Value: 46 \u2192 38 \u2014 I lose 8, bad.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps: hold.\n\nBut I must make a move.\n\nBest idea: **since Brick is highly valued by others, and I have surplus, trade small amounts for hard-to-get but valuable items.**\n\nBut Sheep are valuable but not being offered.\n\nWait\u2014Player 0 offered 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick earlier.\n\nThat means they have Sheep and are willing to trade down.\n\nSo I can try to exploit that.\n\nMake this offer: **Request 2 Sheep, Offer 1 Brick**\n\n- Value Out: 23, In: 36, Net +13\n\nYes! That\u2019s good.\n\nDo they have 2 Sheep? Unknown, but possible.\n\nIs it rational for them? They previously traded 1 Sheep for 1 Brick\u2014same rate. Now I\u2019m asking 2 Sheep for 1 Brick\u2014better for them.\n\nThey would love it.\n\nBut wait: I\u2019m offering 1 Brick for 2 Sheep.\n\nI\u2019m gaining.\n\nIn their previous offer, they wanted to *give* 1 Sheep to *get* 1 Brick \u2014 so they value Sheep \u2264 Brick.\n\nSo they won\u2019t accept giving 2 Sheep for 1 Brick \u2014 that\u2019s worse for them.\n\nMistake.\n\nThey value 1 Sheep = or < 1 Brick, so 2 Sheep > 1 Brick.\n\nSo they won\u2019t give 2 Sheep for 1 Brick.\n\nSo that won\u2019t work.\n\nReverse: Offer 2 Brick \u2192 Request 1 Sheep\n\n- Value: 46 \u2192 18 \u2014 I lose 28, terrible.\n\nNo.\n\nSo trading Brick for Sheep is bad.\n\nUnless I bundle.\n\nAnother idea: trade up from low-value surplus.\n\nI have 14 Wheat \u2014 6 each.\n\nOffer: 12 Wheat \u2192 Request 1 Wood\n\n- Value: 72 \u2192 8 \u2014 no.\n\nRequest 1 Brick: 72 \u2192 23 \u2014 still bad.\n\nNot working.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the best use is to ** capitalize on the fact that others value Brick highly**.\n\nSo offer: 1 Brick \u2192 Request 1 Ore\n\n- Value: 23 \u2192 38 = +15\n\nYes! This is excellent.\n\nOre is 38, Brick 23 \u2014 so I gain 15 value.\n\nDo I have Brick? Yes, 24 \u2014 can spare 1.\n\nDo they have Ore? Unknown, but Player 0 previously requested 1 Ore (offered 7 Wheat for 1 Ore), so they may have some or know it's valuable.\n\nIs it rational for them? They would give 38 to get 23 \u2014 net loss of 15 \u2014 unlikely.\n\nUnless they desperately need Brick.\n\nBut possible in negotiation.\n\nBetter: 1 Ore is very valuable \u2014 hard to get.\n\nPerhaps wait.\n\nBut I must act.\n\nBest possible: **Offer a fair value trade that increases my total value portfolio.**\n\nSince Ore > Brick > Sheep > Wood > Wheat, I should try to convert Brick to Ore or Sheep to Ore.\n\nBut I don\u2019t have a way.\n\nAnother idea: I have 20 Ore \u2014 do I want to *sell* some?\n\nOffer: 1 Ore \u2192 Request 2 Brick\n\n- Value: 38 \u2192 46 = +8\n\nYes! That\u2019s good.\n\nI give 1 Ore (38), get 2 Brick (46), net +8.\n\nI have 20 Ore \u2014 plenty.\n\nThey get 1 Ore, I get 2 Brick.\n\nIs it believable? They previously wanted 1 Ore for 7 Wheat \u2014 so they value Ore highly.\n\nMight be willing to pay 2 Brick for 1 Ore.\n\nOffer: 1 Ore \u2192 2 Brick\n\nLet's compute:\n\n- My value out: 38\n- My value in: 46\n- Net: +8\n\nPortfolio total increases.\n\nCurrent total value:\n14\u00d76 = 84 (Wheat)\n13\u00d78 = 104 (Wood)\n5\u00d718 = 90 (Sheep)\n24\u00d723 = 552 (Brick)\n20\u00d738 = 760 (Ore)\nTotal = 84+104=188; +90=278; +552=830; +760=1590\n\nAfter trade:\nOre: 19 \u2192 19\u00d738 = 722\nBrick: 26 \u2192 26\u00d723 = 598\nTotal Brick+Ore: 722+598=1320\nPreviously: 760+552=1312 \u2192 increase by 8.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd Brick is easier to trade later.\n\nSo this trade increases value by 8.\n\nAlso, I still have 19 Ore \u2014 plenty.\n\nSo this is a good move.\n\nMake the offer.\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Optimization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I should aim to trade away lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or trade resources I have in surplus for resources I need more of, even if the per-unit value isn't drastically different, as long as the net change is positive.\n2.  **Resource Ratios and Marginal Utility:** Understand the inherent value of each resource. Ore (38) and Brick (26) are my highest value resources. Wheat (5) and Wood (9) are my lowest. Sheep (17) is mid-range. I have a large quantity of Wheat, making it a good candidate for trading, but I need to be careful not to devalue it too much in trades.\n3.  **Understanding Opponent's Needs (Inferred):** Player 1 rejected my previous offers for Brick (1 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick). This suggests Player 1 either values Brick highly, has a surplus of it and isn't looking to trade it away for what I'm offering, or is looking for a better deal. Player 1's current offer of \"1 Ore -> 2 Brick\" indicates they value Brick less than Ore, or they are trying to acquire Brick for a specific purpose at a good rate for them.\n4.  **Offer Evaluation (Current Offer):** Player 1 is offering 1 Ore (Value: 38) for 2 Brick (Value: 2 * 26 = 52).\n    *   My perspective: If I accept, I lose 2 Brick (Value 52) and gain 1 Ore (Value 38). This results in a net **loss of 14 value**. This is a bad trade for me.\n5.  **Strategic Negotiation:** My previous offers for Brick were rejected. Player 1 is now directly offering to *give me* Ore in exchange for Brick. This is a complete reversal of my previous attempts to *get* Brick. This indicates Player 1 might desperately need Brick or believes they can get a good deal. I should exploit this.\n6.  **Counter-Offering:** Do not accept offers that decrease my total value. Counter with an offer that favors me, leveraging Player 1's apparent need or willingness to trade Ore. Since I have 8 Brick and Player 1 is offering 1 Ore, perhaps I can get more Ore, or trade less Brick, or combine with other low-value resources. I have a fair amount of Brick (8), so shedding 1 or 2 is manageable if the return is good.\n\nCurrent Resources:\n*   Wheat: Qty: 23 Value: 5\n*   Wood: Qty: 7 Value: 9\n*   Sheep: Qty: 13 Value: 17\n*   Brick: Qty: 8 Value: 26\n*   Ore: Qty: 7 Value: 38\n\nPlayer 1's Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick (My perspective: give 2 Brick, get 1 Ore)\n\nDecision:\nThe current offer is disadvantageous (52 value out for 38 value in). I will deny this offer.\nGiven Player 1 is offering Ore and seems to want Brick, I can try to get more Ore, or trade Brick for something else I need. Since Ore is my highest value resource, getting more Ore is highly desirable. I have a substantial amount of Wheat and Sheep. I will try to counter by reducing the amount of Brick I give, or asking for additional resources alongside the Ore.\n\nStrategy: Since Player 1 is willing to give Ore, I will try to maximize the Ore I get, or minimize the Brick I give. I will propose a direct counter.\n\nWhat about 1 Ore for just 1 Brick? (Value 38 for Value 26, a gain of 12 for me). This is a good trade for me, but maybe too greedy if Player 1 wants 2.\nWhat about 1 Ore for 1 Brick and some Wheat? (Value 38 for Value 26 + 5 = 31, a gain of 7 for me). Still good.\nWhat about 2 Brick for more than 1 Ore? (e.g., 2 Brick for 2 Ore). Unlikely Player 1 would accept.\n\nGiven Player 1 offered 1 Ore for 2 Brick, they are trying to get Brick efficiently. My previous offers failed to get Brick from them. This implies they *want* Brick. I have a lot of Wheat. Perhaps I can offer a combination that is more palatable to them, offering Wheat alongside a small amount of Brick for Ore.\n\nThe most direct counter to their offer of \"1 Ore for 2 Brick\" would be to reverse the ratio slightly to my favor.\nProposed counter: \"1 Brick -> 1 Ore\" This is a good gain for me (38-26=12 value). Player 1 might accept it if they really want Brick and believe Ore is less valuable to them than Brick at that ratio.\n\nLet's consider quantity as well. I have 8 Brick. Trading 1 or 2 is fine. 7 Ore.\nMaybe I can leverage my surplus Wheat to make the deal sweeter for them while still good for me.\n\nLet's try to get Ore more efficiently.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Understand Your Current Inventory and Values:** List out all resources, their quantities, and individual values. Calculate your total current net worth: (23 * 5) + (7 * 9) + (13 * 17) + (8 * 26) + (7 * 38) = 115 + 63 + 221 + 208 + 266 = 873.\n2.  **Identify High-Value Resources You Own:** Ore (38), Brick (26), Sheep (17), Wood (9), Wheat (5). My most valuable resource is Ore.\n3.  **Identify Low-Value Resources You Own in Quantity:** Wheat (5) has the lowest value and highest quantity. This is often good for trading *away* to acquire higher-value items.\n4.  **Identify High-Value Resources You Want More Of:** Ore and Brick are the highest value items per unit. Acquiring more of these should be a priority.\n5.  **Principle of Comparative Advantage/Mutual Gain:** A good trade makes both parties better off. This typically means trading away resources you have in abundance or value less for resources you value more or have less of.\n6.  **Calculate Trade Ratios (Implicit Value):**\n    *   1 Ore (38) is worth ~7.6 Wheat (38/5).\n    *   1 Brick (26) is worth ~5.2 Wheat (26/5).\n    *   1 Ore (38) is worth ~1.46 Brick (38/26).\n    *   1 Brick (26) is worth ~1.5 Sheep (26/17).\n7.  **Evaluate Past Offers:**\n    *   P0: 7 Wheat (35) -> 1 Ore (38). Rejected by P1. (P0 offering slightly less value than receiving, which is good for P0, but not enough for P1)\n    *   P0: 1 Sheep (17) -> 1 Brick (26). Rejected by P1. (P0 offering much less value than receiving, good for P0)\n    *   P0: 6 Wheat (30) -> 1 Brick (26). Rejected by P1. (P0 offering more value than receiving - P1 should have taken this if they wanted Brick or valued Wheat more than P0 did, perhaps they don't need Brick as much as P0 expects or they value Wheat highly too, or they need even more value).\n    *   P1: 1 Ore (38) -> 2 Brick (52). Rejected by P0. (P0 would lose 14 value, bad for P0). P0 was right to reject.\n    *   P0: 1 Brick (26) -> 1 Ore (38). Rejected by P1. (P0 offering less value than receiving, good for P0).\n    *   P1: 6 Wheat (30) -> 1 Ore (38). This is the *current* offer. P1 is asking for 6 Wheat (value 30) for 1 Ore (value 38). This is a net gain of 8 value for Player 0 (38 - 30 = 8). This is a good trade for Player 0!\n8.  **Negotiation Strategy:**\n    *   Look for trades that increase your total value.\n    *   Be willing to offer a bit more than the intrinsic value of what you're receiving, *if* the overall trade still increases your net worth. However, ideally you want to get more value than you give.\n    *   Player 1 seems to value Ore highly, or requires Wheat.\n    *   Previous offers from P0 that were rejected suggest P1 wants more value for their high-value resources, or is not interested in low-value resources unless the ratio is very favorable to them.\n\nP1's current offer: 6 Wheat (value 30) for 1 Ore (value 38).\nThis trade would increase my total value by 8 (38 - 30). I would go from 23 Wheat to 17 Wheat, and from 7 Ore to 8 Ore. This directly increases my total resource value.\n\n[Accept]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: What key principles, strategies, or insights about resource trading and negotiation are most relevant to your current situation?\n\n1. **Value Asymmetry and Comparative Advantage**: Effective trades arise when players value resources differently. Since Ore is your highest-value resource (38), you should be cautious about giving it away unless receiving significant value in return. Conversely, Wheat is your lowest-value resource (6), so trading excess Wheat for higher-value resources is strategically sound.\n\n2. **Resource Scarcity and Demand**: Brick (23) and Ore (38) are high-value, and you have high quantities of both (24 and 20). While you are well-stocked in these, others may need them, giving you leverage. However, Sheep is low in quantity (5) and high in value (18), making it relatively scarce for you\u2014trade it sparingly.\n\n3. **Trade Efficiency and Net Value Gain**: A good trade increases total portfolio value. Offering low-value resources (like Wheat) to acquire higher-value ones (Ore, Brick, Sheep) improves your position. Always aim for positive net value exchange, factoring in volume and scarcity.\n\n4. **Negotiation Dynamics and Turn Limit**: With only 10 turns total and several already used, time is limited. Frequent rejection suggests misalignment in valuation. You must make compelling offers that appeal to the other player's needs while still benefiting you.\n\n5. **Iterative Strategy and Signaling**: Repeated offers of similar types (e.g., Wheat for Ore) indicate interest. Since your previous offer of 6 Wheat for 1 Ore was accepted, this exchange rate is viable. You can exploit this proven willingness to trade at that ratio.\n\n6. **Opportunity Cost**: Holding 14 Wheat (value 6) means you could convert low-utility stock into high-utility resources. Since Ore is worth 38 and you gave up 6\u00d76=36 Wheat value to get 38 Ore value last trade, that was a net gain\u2014repeat this if possible.\n\n7. **Counterparty Incentives**: Player 0 has shown willingness to trade Ore for Wheat and Brick for Sheep/Wheat. They may be low on basic resources. Use this to your advantage by offering Wheat to target Ore or Sheep.\n\nConclusion: Your optimal strategy is to **leverage surplus Wheat to acquire high-value or scarce resources**, especially Ore. Since a 6 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore trade was recently accepted, it represents a proven, favorable exchange. Repeat or slightly adjust offers based on this.\n\nTrading Decision:\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

I also have a decent quantity of Sheep (13). These are good candidates to trade away for higher-value resources.\n4.  **Identify Resources to Acquire:** Ore (38) is the most valuable resource, followed by Brick (26). Prioritize acquiring these.\n5.  **Calculate Trade Ratios (Implied Value Exchange):**\n    *   To gain value, I should trade low-value resources for high-value resources.\n    *   For example, if I trade Wheat (5) for Ore (38), I need to offer at least 8 Wheat (40 value) for 1 Ore (38 value) to be roughly equitable, and ideally less Wheat for more value gain.\n    *   Previously, I accepted 6 Wheat (30 value) for 1 Ore (38 value), which was a net gain of 8 value. This was a good trade. This suggests Player 1 values Wheat highly or undervalues Ore slightly.\n6.  **Analyze Past Trades:**\n    *   My previous offers: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore (rejected), 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick (rejected), 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick (rejected), 1 Brick -> 1 Ore (rejected).\n    *   Player 1's previous offers: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick (rejected - I wanted Ore), 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore (accepted - good trade for me).\n    *   The successful trade (6 Wheat for 1 Ore) indicates Player 1 is willing to give up Ore for Wheat. This is a strong indicator of their needs/preferences.\n7.  **Formulate a Strategy:**\n    *   Leverage my surplus of low-value resources (Wheat, perhaps Sheep) to acquire high-value resources (Ore, Brick).\n    *   Since Player 1 just offered 6 Wheat for 1 Ore and I accepted, they might be open to a similar deal again, or I can try to push for an even better ratio for myself.\n    *   I have 23 Wheat. Trading 6 Wheat for 1 Ore is a net gain of 38 - 30 = 8 value per trade. I can do this multiple times if Player 1 is willing.\n    *   I need to be careful not to deplete my low-value resources too quickly, but given I have 23 Wheat, several such trades are possible.\n    *   Consider offering Wheat for Brick if Ore becomes too difficult to acquire, as Brick is still much more valuable than Wheat.\n\nTrading Decision:\nPlayer 1 offered 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore. I just accepted this. It implies they still want Wheat and are willing to give up Ore. This is a very good deal for me (30 value for 38 value). I should continue to pursue this type of trade. I have plenty of Wheat and gaining Ore increases my total value significantly.\n\nSince Player 1 just made this offer, and I accepted, I anticipate they might make a similar offer again or be receptive to me making a similar offer. I have 17 Wheat left after the last trade.\n\nI should try to replicate the successful trade.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
