      "response": "### Generated Knowledge on Resource Trading and Negotiation\n\nBased on my current situation in the Negotiation Game, where my goal is to increase the total value of my resources, I've generated the following relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation. This draws from key principles, strategies, and insights commonly applied in competitive trading games:\n\n1. **Value Assessment and Prioritization**: Always calculate the net value gain or loss in any trade. In this game, resources have specific values per unit (e.g., Wheat at 6 per unit, Brick at 28 per unit), so prioritize trading low-value resources (like Wheat at 6) for high-value ones (like Ore at 32 or Brick at 28). The key insight is to ensure that the total value of resources you receive exceeds the total value of what you give, as this directly aligns with the objective of increasing your overall portfolio value. Avoid trades that result in a net loss, as they undermine your long-term position in the 10-turn game.\n\n2. **Resource Abundance and Scarcity**: Leverage your excess resources (e.g., I have 24 Sheep and 20 Brick, indicating abundance) to trade for scarce or high-value resources (e.g., I only have 10 Ore, which is my most valuable resource per unit). A strategy here is to offload surpluses that have lower marginal utility (like Wheat, which has the lowest value at 6 per unit) to acquire items that can significantly boost your total value. This follows the principle of \"efficient allocation,\" where you convert underperforming assets into higher-performing ones.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics**: Start with offers that favor you slightly but are realistic to encourage acceptance. For instance, propose trades where the value you offer is close to or slightly less than what you request, but always aim for a net gain. Be cautious not to over-reveal your needs\u2014focus on what you have in abundance. In a multi-turn game, build goodwill with balanced offers early on, as repeated interactions may occur. A core insight is to use asymmetry: trade quantity of low-value items for quality (higher-value items) from others who might value your excess more than you do.\n\n4. **Risk Management in a Limited-Turn Game**: With only 10 turns, avoid overly aggressive or one-sided offers that could lead to denials and wasted turns. Instead, opt for incremental gains per turn to steadily increase your total value. Monitor the opportunity cost\u2014if a trade doesn't improve your position, default to [Deny] for incoming offers. Additionally, consider the other players' potential perspectives; they might prioritize different resources, so tailor offers to what they could reasonably want (e.g., if they lack Sheep, which I have in abundance).\n\n5. **General Trading Principles**: Follow the rule of \"mutual benefit\" to make offers more appealing, but ensure your benefit is greater. Use data-driven decisions: calculate exact values (e.g., total value = quantity \u00d7 value per unit) before proposing. If no incoming offers are present, initiate trades proactively to control the pace. Insights from games like Catan emphasize that successful negotiators are patient, adaptable, and focused on long-term gains rather than short-term trades.\n\nThis knowledge applies directly to my resource profile, where I have low-value Wheat (total value: 16 \u00d7 6 = 96) and abundant Sheep (total value: 24 \u00d7 12 = 288), which I can use to target high-value Ore (32 per unit) or Brick (28 per unit) for net gains.\n\n### Application of Knowledge and Trading Decision\n\nApplying the generated knowledge, I first assess my current total resource value:\n- Wheat: 16 qty \u00d7 6 value per unit = 96 total value\n- Wood: 15 qty \u00d7 12 value per unit = 180 total value\n- Sheep: 24 qty \u00d7 12 value per unit = 288 total value\n- Brick: 20 qty \u00d7 28 value per unit = 560 total value\n- Ore: 10 qty \u00d7 32 value per unit = 320 total value\n- **Overall Total Value: 96 + 180 + 288 + 560 + 320 = 1,444**\n\nMy strategy is to trade from abundance (e.g., Sheep, which I have 24 of) for higher-value resources (e.g., Brick or Ore) to achieve a net value increase. Sheep has a moderate value (12 per unit), but I can use it to acquire Brick (28 per unit) for a gain. For example, offering 2 Sheep (value: 2 \u00d7 12 = 24) for 1 Brick (value: 28) would result in a net gain of 4 value, increasing my total to 1,448.\n\nSince there are no incoming offers mentioned, I'll initiate a trade to proactively improve my position. This aligns with the tactic of starting with a balanced but favorable offer on Turn 1.\n\n**Action: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]**",

      "response": "### Generate Trade-Related Knowledge:\n\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This is paramount. Every trade must be evaluated against this goal.\n2.  **Valuation:** Understand the \"true\" value of each resource.\n    *   Wheat: 5\n    *   Wood: 12\n    *   Sheep: 17\n    *   Brick: 29\n    *   Ore: 32\n3.  **Calculate Current Value:** My total current value is (17 * 5) + (9 * 12) + (21 * 17) + (13 * 29) + (7 * 32) = 85 + 108 + 357 + 377 + 224 = 1151. Every trade should aim to increase this number.\n4.  **Trade Ratios (My Perspective):**\n    *   1 Brick (29) is worth more than 1 Sheep (17), so gaining Brick for Sheep is generally good.\n    *   1 Ore (32) is worth more than 1 Brick (29), so gaining Ore for Brick is generally good.\n    *   1 Wheat (5) is low value. Good to trade away for higher value items.\n    *   1 Sheep (17) is medium value.\n    *   1 Wood (12) is medium-low value.\n5.  **Evaluating Offers:**\n    *   Value of what I *give up* vs. Value of what I *gain*.\n    *   Gain must be > Give.\n    *   (Value Gained) - (Value Given) = Net Profit. Aim for positive net profit.\n6.  **Supply and Demand (Implicit):** While not explicitly stated, common resources might be less valuable, rare resources more. My quantities: Sheep (21), Wheat (17), Brick (13), Wood (9), Ore (7). I have a lot of Sheep and Wheat, and less of Ore. This makes my Sheep and Wheat more expendable, and Ore more desirable (as I have less of it and it's high value).\n7.  **Negotiation Posture:** What kind of trades should I propose?\n    *   I want to acquire high-value resources (Ore, Brick) and divest low-value resources (Wheat, Wood, possibly some Sheep).\n    *   Aim for favorable ratios (e.g., giving 1 cheap resource for 1 expensive resource, or 2 cheap for 1 expensive).\n8.  **Opponent's Perspective (Inferred):** Player 0 offered 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick. This means they value 1 Brick more than 2 Sheep, or they are rich in Brick and want Sheep, or they are poor in Sheep.\n    *   My valuation: 2 Sheep = 34. 1 Brick = 29.\n    *   From my perspective, this offer is a net *loss* of 5 value (29 - 34 = -5).\n    *   Player 0 must value Sheep highly relative to Brick. Perhaps their supply of Sheep is low, or they need Sheep for something specific.\n\n### Trading Decision:\n\n**Player 0's Offer:** Offered items: 2 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Brick\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   Value of resources I give: 2 Sheep * 17 = 34\n*   Value of resources I gain: 1 Brick * 29 = 29\n*   Net change in value for me: 29 (gain) - 34 (give) = -5\n\nThis offer would decrease my total resource value. Therefore, I should not accept it.\n\n**Response:** I will deny the current offer and make a counter-offer that benefits me. Player 0 seems interested in Sheep and has Brick. I value Brick. Let's propose a trade that gives them Sheep but gains me value, possibly by giving them more Sheep for a higher gain in Brick, or by involving another resource. Since Sheep is something they want, I can try to leverage that. My goal is to get Brick (29) or Ore (32) while giving away less than I gain.\n\nIf 1 Brick is 29, and 1 Sheep is 17.\nIf I give 1 Sheep for 1 Brick, I gain 12. Unlikely they would accept.\nPlayer 0 offered 2 Sheep for 1 Brick (their valuation: 2 Sheep < 1 Brick, my valuation: 2 Sheep > 1 Brick).\n\nLet's try to get more than 1 Brick, or bundle a low-value resource.\nGiven they value Sheep, I have 21. I can afford to give some up.\n\nTarget: Gain Brick (29) or Ore (32).\nOffer: 1 Wood (12) + 1 Sheep (17) = 29. If I ask for 1 Brick (29), it's a neutral trade. I want positive.\nOffer: 2 Wheat (10) + 1 Sheep (17) = 27. If I ask for 1 Brick (29), I gain 2. This is a possibility.\n\nLet's capitalize on their apparent need for Sheep. I'll offer a slightly different ratio on Sheep for Brick, or try to offload Wheat.\n\nCurrent state: Player 0 wants Sheep and is giving Brick. I want Brick and can give Sheep.\nTheir offer: 2 Sheep (34) for 1 Brick (29) -- a bad deal for me.\nMy counter should aim for: (Value given) < (Value gained).\n\nConsider giving 1 Sheep for 1 Brick + something small, or a 1-for-1 of lower value for higher value.\nWhat if I offer a low value resource + a Sheep for a Brick?\n\nLet's try to offload Wheat, as it's my lowest value resource.\nI have 17 Wheat.\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (15) + 1 Sheep (17) = 32. I can ask for 1 Ore (32), it breaks even. No profit.\nIf I ask for 1 Brick (29): 32 offered, 29 gained. Still a loss.\n\nI need to turn this around. Player 0 *wants* Sheep.\nMy high value resources are Ore (32) and Brick (29).\nMy low value resources are Wheat (5) and Wood (12). Sheep (17) is medium.\n\nIf Player 0 is willing to give Brick for Sheep, I should try to get more than 1 Brick for my Sheep, or give fewer Sheep for 1 Brick.\n\nLet's try a direct counter on the Sheep/Brick axis that benefits me.\nPlayer 0 offered: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick (Valuation for me: -5)\nHow about 1 Sheep for 1 Brick? (My valuation: +12) -- Player 0 is unlikely to take this given their previous offer.\n\nWhat if I acknowledge their desire for Sheep, and offer some, but get a much better return?\nI give 3 Sheep (51) to get 2 Brick (58). I gain 7 value.\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick] has a net positive for me (58 - 51 = +7). This also uses up 3 Sheep, which I have a lot of.\n\nLet's think about a trade that focuses on maximizing the value delta. I have 21 Sheep.\nIf I trade 1 Sheep (17) for 1 Brick (29), that's +12 value. This is excellent.\nIf I trade 1 Wheat (5) for 1 Wood (12), that's +7 value.\nIf I trade 1 Wood (12) for 1 Sheep (17), that's +5 value.\n\nSince Player 0 offered Brick for Sheep, they have Brick and want Sheep.\nI need to make an offer that is slightly better for me than their offer for them, or significantly better for me.\n\nMy most profitable single resource trade would be to acquire Ore (32) or Brick (29) from Wheat (5) or Wood (12).\nI have 13 Brick and 7 Ore. I want more of these.\nI have 17 Wheat and 9 Wood. I want less of these.\n\nGiven the previous offer, Player 0 is giving 1 Brick (29) for 2 Sheep (34).\nThis implied Player 0 values 1 Brick as less than 2 Sheep, or they need Sheep badly.\nI should exploit this.\n\nMy counter:\nStrategy 1: Give low-value items for their Brick. (e.g., 2 Wood for 1 Brick, my gain: 29 - 24 = +5. They gain 2 Wood. Don't know if they want Wood).\nStrategy 2: Give Sheep, but get a better return than their offer.\n\nLet's go with Strategy 2, as it directly counters their proposal and validates their desire for Sheep.\nThey offered: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick. (Value I give: 34, Value I get: 29. Net -5 for me).\nMy counter needs to be positive.\nIf I offer 1 Sheep for 1 Brick, I gain 12. Player 0 will likely refuse if they just offered 2 Sheep for 1 Brick.\n\nHow about I offer 2 Sheep (34) for 2 Brick (58)? Net +24 for me. Too greedy.\nWhat if I offer 3 Sheep (51) for 2 Brick (58)? Net +7 for me. This is a good value increase.\n2 Sheep -> 1 Brick was Player 0's offer. Value (2 Sheep) > Value (1 Brick) from my perspective.\nMy counter: 2 Sheep (34) for 1 Brick (29) + 1 Wood (12)? -> 41 - 34 = +7. (I give 2 Sheep, I get 1 Brick and 1 Wood -- gains resources)\nThis uses their stated desire (Sheep) but gives me more varied resources and value.\n\nLet's try to keep it simple with Brick as the main currency.\nPlayer 0 wants Sheep, Player 1 wants Brick.\nPlayer 0 says 1 Brick = 2 Sheep. (From Player 0's perspective, they value 1 Brick equivalent to or less than 2 Sheep).\nFrom my perspective, 1 Brick (29) < 2 Sheep (34). So I lose.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat (17+5=22) for 1 Brick (29)?\nMy gain: 29 - 22 = +7. This is a very good trade for me, offloading Wheat and getting high-value Brick. Player 0 gets Sheep, which they seem to want, and Wheat, which is low value. This might be plausible.\n\nFinal decision on the offer:\nValue given: 2 Sheep (34)\nValue gained: 1 Brick (29)\nOutcome: Value decreases by 5.\n\nI must deny this offer.\n\nFor my counteroffer, I want to gain more than I give.\nI will try to offload Wheat (low value) and Sheep (abundant, and Player 0 seems to want it) to gain Brick.\n\nMy proposition: give them resources they want, but at a better rate for me.\nI have a lot of Sheep (21) and Wheat (17). Player 0 offered 2 Sheep for 1 Brick.\nWhat if I give 2 *low-value* resources for 1 Brick?\nMy 2 lowest value resources are Wheat (5) and Wood (12).\n2 Wheat (10) for 1 Brick (29): +19 value. Too good.\n2 Wood (24) for 1 Brick (29): +5 value. This is plausible. It costs them Brick, but they get Wood.\nBut Player 0 offered Sheep. So incorporating Sheep is probably best.\n\nLet's re-evaluate 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat for 1 Brick.\nI give: 1 Sheep (17) + 1 Wheat (5) = 22\nI gain: 1 Brick (29)\nNet profit for me: 29 - 22 = +7. This is a positive value and utilizes my common/low-value resources. And it involves Sheep, which Player 0 seems to want.\n\nFinal Offer Strategy: Deny the immediate loss-making offer, and counter with a profitable one that utilizes their apparent need for Sheep while offloading my low-value Wheat.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are crucial for maximizing value, especially in a limited-turn game like this with only 10 turns. First, always evaluate trades based on your personal valuation of resources: calculate the net value gain or loss by comparing the total value of resources you're offering versus those you're receiving. For instance, prioritize acquiring high-value resources (like Brick at 28 value per unit or Ore at 32) by trading away lower-value ones (like Wheat at 6), ensuring that any trade results in a net increase in total resource value. Second, understand supply and demand\u2014leverage your abundance (e.g., I have 24 Sheep and 20 Brick) to negotiate favorable terms, but avoid overtrading scarce resources (like my 10 Ore). Third, in negotiations, reject unfavorable offers and counter with proposals that benefit you, such as starting with even or slightly advantageous exchanges to encourage reciprocity. Finally, be strategic about timing and psychology: since turns are limited, act assertively but not desperately, and use rejections as signals of the other player's preferences (e.g., Player 1 seems interested in Brick but rejected my previous offer, indicating they value it highly).\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision\n\nAnalyzing Player 1's offer (3 Sheep for 2 Brick), the values are clear: I would give up 2 Brick (2 * 28 = 56 total value) and receive 3 Sheep (3 * 12 = 36 total value), resulting in a net loss of 20 value. This does not align with my goal of increasing total resource value, so I must deny it. Based on my abundance of Sheep (24 quantity) and the insight that Player 1 wants Brick, I'll counter with an offer that gives me a slight net gain: trading 4 Sheep (4 * 12 = 48 value) for 1 Brick (28 value), netting me a gain of 20 value.

This suggests Player 0 wants a better exchange rate for their Brick.\n    *   _Current Offer 2 (P0):_ 4 Sheep (4*17=68) -> 1 Brick (1*29=29). This is a significant loss for me (-39). Absolutely unacceptable.\n7.  **Determining Fair/Beneficial Ratios:**\n    *   To get 1 Brick (29 value) for Sheep (17 value): I need to give up at most 1 Brick / 17 Sheep = 1.7 Sheep. So, 1 Sheep for 1 Brick is a win (17 for 29), 2 Sheep for 1 Brick is a loss (34 for 29). I want to give 1 Sheep for 1 Brick ideally, or 2 Sheep for 2 Brick.\n    *   Player 0's valuation of Sheep for Brick seems to be significantly higher than mine (they offered 4 Sheep for 1 Brick previously, which is an extremely bad deal for me).\n8.  **Negotiation Posture:** Player 0 is being very aggressive in their offers for Brick. Their current offer is terrible for me. I need to continue to reject unfavorable offers and counter with trades that generate net value for me. I have plenty of Sheep, so trading them is not an issue as long as I gain value.\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 4 Sheep (4 * 17 = 68) -> Requested: 1 Brick (1 * 29 = 29)\nValue change for me: 29 (received) - 68 (given) = -39.

Player 0 won't accept.\nLet's try 2 Brick for 3 Sheep, which Player 0 rejected previously. Player 0 rejected my 3 Sheep for 2 Brick offer. This means they value 2 Brick more than 3 Sheep OR they value their Brick more than they value 3 Sheep. However, they offered 4 Sheep for 1 Brick. This indicates their internal ratio for exchange is very different from mine.\n\nThey offered 4 Sheep -> 1 Brick. My value gain: 29 - 68 = -39.\nI offered 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick.

Still a loss. I need to get *more* than 2 Sheep's value if I'm giving 2 Sheep for 1 Brick.\n\nI have an abundance of Sheep (21). I want high-value resources.\nSince Player 0 rejected my 3 Sheep for 2 Brick, I will try to aim for 1 Brick for 1 Sheep. It's highly unlikely they will accept given their prior offers, but it sets my negotiating baseline. If they really want Sheep and I want Brick, they might eventually move. Or, I can propose something that gives me slightly less value but might be accepted.\n\nMy current offer stands at 3 Sheep for 2 Brick (gain +7). Player 0 rejected this.\nPlayer 0's offers are for 1 Brick for 4 Sheep (loss -39).\n\nThis means there's a significant gap. I am not desperate for any resources yet. I should continue to make offers that are beneficial to me, or reject theirs.\n\nPlayer 0's offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Brick (my loss)\nI should reject this. My counter should be something that benefits me.\nWhat if I offer 2 Sheep for 1 Brick? (2 * 17 = 34 -> 1 * 29 = 29). This is a loss of 5. I should not accept this either.\n\nI need to gain value.\nI have a lot of Sheep. It's my third most valuable resource, but my quantity is high, so it's a good one to trade.\nMaybe Player 0 won't trade 2 Brick for 3 Sheep. What about 1 Brick for less Sheep?\nThe best trade for me in terms of Sheep for Brick would be 1 Sheep for 1 Brick (17 to 29, gain +12). This is too good for me and they likely won't accept.\n\nLet's stick to the principle of \"gain value\".\nCurrent offer: Player 0 offered 4 Sheep for 1 Brick. I reject.\nI will counter with an offer that targets a gain for me. My last offer of 3 Sheep for 2 Brick was +7 value for me. Player 0 rejected it.\nMaybe I can try to give up fewer sheep for 1 brick, or get more brick for the same amount of sheep to make it more profitable for me.\n\nGiven Player 0's very bad offer (4 Sheep for 1 Brick), I should stand firm.\nI will reject the current offer. I will counter with an offer that still yields me a profit, possibly trying to get a higher value resource than Brick. Or stick to Brick, but at a very favorable rate.\nGiven Player 0 is consistently asking for Sheep and offering Brick, I will stick to this pair.\n\nI have 21 Sheep.\nI want Brick (29) or Ore (32).\nIf I give 1 Sheep (17) for 1 Brick (29) -> +12\nIf I give 2 Sheep (34) for 2 Brick (58) -> +24\nIf I give 3 Sheep (51) for 2 Brick (58) -> +7 (My last offer, rejected)\nIf I give 4 Sheep (68) for 2 Brick (58) -> -10 (Loss)\n\nSince Player 0 rejected 3 Sheep for 2 Brick (which was +7 for me), they are clearly very protective of their Brick or very eager for Sheep.\nI need to make an offer that is strictly to my benefit.\n\nIf I offered 2 Sheep for 1 Brick, it's a loss to me (-5).\nSo, I must offer 1 Sheep for 1 Brick. This is my best possible trade for Sheep -> Brick.\n\nThink about a small, profitable trade to test the waters.\nWhat if I try to get an Ore for my Sheep?\n1 Sheep (17) for 1 Ore (32) -> +15. Very good for me.\n2 Sheep (34) for 1 Ore (32) -> -2. Bad.\n\nSo, 1 Sheep for 1 Brick is my best bet for now, or 1 Sheep for 1 Ore.\nGiven Player 0's repeated desire for Sheep and offering Brick, I'll stick to Sheep for Brick.\n\nRejecting the offer of 4 Sheep for 1 Brick is a given.\nI will counter. I will re-offer 1 Sheep for 1 Brick. It's highly beneficial to me and sets a strong precedent.\n\nAction: [Deny]\nCounter-Offer: [Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation, especially in a competitive game like this where the goal is to maximize the total value of my resources, several key principles and strategies are relevant to my current situation:\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: Always evaluate trades based on the net change in total resource value. For each resource, I need to calculate the value per unit to assess whether a trade increases my overall value. My resources have the following approximate values per unit (based on total value divided by quantity):\n   - Wheat: 6 / 16 \u2248 0.375 per unit\n   - Wood: 12 / 15 \u2248 0.8 per unit\n   - Sheep: 12 / 24 \u2248 0.5 per unit\n   - Brick: 28 / 20 \u2248 1.4 per unit\n   - Ore: 32 / 10 \u2248 3.2 per unit\n   This means I should only accept or propose trades where the value of resources I receive exceeds the value of resources I give away, aiming for a positive net gain.\n\n2. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: I have an abundance of Sheep (24 units) with a low per-unit value (0.5), making it a good resource to trade away. In contrast, I have Brick (20 units at 1.4 per unit) and Ore (10 units at 3.2 per unit), which are more valuable to me, so I should be cautious about trading them unless I get significant value in return. From the trade history, Player 1 seems eager for Brick (as they've repeatedly requested it) but is offering Sheep, indicating they have excess Sheep and value Brick highly. I can leverage this by demanding better terms.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics**: In a limited-turn game (only 10 turns total), I should avoid unfavorable deals and use counter-offers to gradually improve my position. For instance:\n   - Reject or deny offers that result in a net loss.\n   - Propose counter-offers that align with the other player's interests while favoring me, such as offering more of my abundant, low-value resources (e.g., Sheep) for their higher-value ones.\n   - Build on past interactions: Player 1 has rejected my previous offers (e.g., 2 or 4 Sheep for 1 Brick) and proposed unfavorable ones (e.g., 3 Sheep for 2 Brick, or now 1 Sheep for 1 Brick), so I need to escalate my demands or find a sweet spot.\n\n4. **Risk and Turn Management**: With only a few turns left (the game has already had several exchanges), I should prioritize trades that provide immediate value gains to avoid stagnation. If no deal is possible, denying and proposing a new offer keeps the negotiation alive, but I must ensure my offers are realistic to avoid repeated rejections.\n\n5. **Psychological Insights**: Players often start with aggressive demands and concede over time. Player 1's latest offer (1 Sheep for 1 Brick) is even worse for me than their previous one (3 Sheep for 2 Brick), suggesting they're testing my limits. I should respond firmly by denying and counter-offering something more balanced, like requesting more Sheep for Brick to exploit their apparent need.\n\nOverall, the key insight is to be strategic and patient: only proceed with trades that enhance my total value, and use the negotiation history to refine my offers.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision\n\nApplying the above knowledge, I first evaluate Player 1's incoming offer: They are offering 1 Sheep (value \u2248 0.5) in exchange for 1 Brick (value \u2248 1.4). This would result in a net value loss for me (0.5 gained - 1.4 lost = -0.9), which violates the principle of value maximization. Therefore, I must deny this offer.\n\nNext, I consider making a counter-offer. Based on supply and demand, I have excess Sheep and Player 1 wants Brick, so I'll propose trading more of my low-value Sheep for their Sheep (to potentially build on their offers). However, to ensure a net gain, I'll aim for an offer where the value I receive exceeds what I give. For example, offering 2 Sheep (value \u2248 1.0) for 1 Brick (value \u2248 1.4) would still be a slight loss, so I'll adjust to request additional resources or better terms. A balanced counter could be offering 1 Brick for more Sheep, aligning with past interactions.\n\nMy decision: Deny the incoming offer and make a new offer that seeks a net value gain. Specifically, I'll offer 1 Brick in exchange for 3 Sheep, as this gives me resources I can potentially trade later (3 Sheep value \u2248 1.5, vs. 1 Brick value \u2248 1.4, for a slight net gain of +0.1).\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I should only accept or propose trades where the value of resources received is greater than the value of resources given, or at least break even if it strategically positions me for future gains (e.g., getting a resource I desperately need for a building, though this game seems to solely focus on resource value).\n2.  **Resource Quantities:** I have significant quantities of Wheat (17) and Sheep (21), which are my lowest value resources. This makes them good candidates for offering in trades, especially if I can consolidate them into higher-value resources. I have fewer high-value resources like Ore (7) and Wood (9), so I should be more cautious about offering them unless the return is substantial. Brick (13) is mid-range in quantity and high in value.\n3.  **Understanding Opponent's Offer:** Player 0 is offering 1 Brick for 3 Sheep.\n    *   My perspective: Value of 1 Brick = 29. Value of 3 Sheep = 3 * 17 = 51.\n    *   This current offer from Player 0 (1 Brick for 3 Sheep) is highly unfavorable to me, as I would lose 51 - 29 = 22 value.\n4.  **Past Offers Analysis:**\n    *   Player 0 offered 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick (Rejected by me): My loss (2*17) - 29 = 34 - 29 = 5. I gained 1 Brick, gave up 2 Sheep. This was a loss.\n    *   My offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick (Rejected by Player 0): My gain (2*29) - (3*17) = 58 - 51 = 7. My target was a gain.\n    *   Player 0 offered 4 Sheep -> 1 Brick (Rejected by me): My loss (4*17) - 29 = 68 - 29 = 39. Massive loss.\n    *   My offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick (Rejected by Player 0): My gain 29 - 17 = 12. Good for me.\n    *   Player 0's current offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep. This means Player 0 *wants* Sheep.\n5.  **Negotiation Strategy - Counter-proposals:** Since Player 0 wants Sheep (as indicated by their last *incoming* offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep, which translates to them *giving* 1 Brick and *requesting* 3 Sheep), and they've consistently tried to get Sheep from me for Brick (or previously offered Sheep for Brick). Their last offer reverses the flow, they now want to *receive* Sheep and *give* Brick (1 Brick -> 3 Sheep means P0 gives 1 Brick, wants 3 Sheep; P1 gives 3 Sheep, wants 1 Brick).\n    *   This is important: \"Offered items: X -> Requested items: Y\" means Player 0 *gives* X and *wants* Y.\n    *   So, Player 0 gave 1 Brick and requested 3 Sheep. This is their offer.\n    *   From my initial rejection of an offer for 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick (where I'd give Sheep to get Brick), to them offering 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep (where I *lose* a lot of value by getting Brick for Sheep). This is consistent.\n    *   The current offer is: Player 0 gives 1 Brick, wants 3 Sheep.\n    *   My value change if I accept: I get 1 Brick (value 29), I give 3 Sheep (value 3*17=51). Net change: 29 - 51 = -22. This is a bad trade for me.\n6.  **Optimal Trade Ratios:** I need to find a ratio where the value I gain is greater than the value I lose.\n    *   My cheap resources are Sheep (17) and Wheat (5). My expensive ones are Ore (32) and Brick (29).\n    *   To get 1 Brick (29 value), I need to give less than 29 value.\n    *   1 Sheep = 17 value.\n    *   2 Sheep = 34 value.\n    *   So 1 Sheep for 1 Brick is a great deal for me (gain 12).\n    *   2 Sheep for 1 Brick is a bad deal for me (lose 5).\n    *   Player 0's offer of 1 Brick for 3 Sheep (-22 value) is terrible.\n    *   I previously offered 1 Sheep for 1 Brick, which Player 0 rejected. This indicates Player 0 values Sheep highly relative to Brick, or they value Brick less than a direct conversion.\n7.  **Maintaining Negotiation Position:** I've previously rejected unfavorable offers. I should continue to do so. My goal is to get 1 Brick for 1 Sheep, or at most 1 Brick for 1 Sheep and some Wheat (if I need to sweeten it slightly without losing too much value).\n8.  **Re-evaluate Player 0's pattern:**\n    *   P0: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick (P0 wants Brick, offers Sheep; bad for me).\n    *   Me: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick (I want Brick, offer Sheep; good for me).\n    *   P0: 4 Sheep -> 1 Brick (P0 wants Brick, offers Sheep; even worse for me).\n    *   Me: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick (I want Brick, offer Sheep; very good for me).\n    *   P0: 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep (P0 wants Sheep, offers Brick; terrible for me because I would *give* 3 Sheep for 1 Brick)\n    *   The interpretation of \"Offered items: X -> Requested items: Y\" consistently means P0 gives X and wants Y, and Player 1 would give Y and get X.\n    *   So Player 0 is offering to give 1 Brick (value 29) in exchange for 3 Sheep (value 51). This is a net loss of 22 for me.\n    *   Player 0 is desperate for Sheep. This gives me leverage.\n    *   I should continue to push for a trade that is favorable to me, given Player 0's apparent need for Sheep.\n\n***\n\nTrading Decision:\nPlayer 0's current offer is to give me 1 Brick (Value 29) in exchange for 3 Sheep (Value 51). This would result in a net value loss of 22 for me (29 - 51 = -22). This is unacceptable. I have previously tried to get 1 Brick for 1 Sheep (value 17), which would be a net gain of 12 for me, but Player 0 rejected it. Player 0 seems desperate for Sheep, but is trying to get a very good deal for themselves. I need to counter with an offer that still benefits me, but is perhaps less extreme than 1 Sheep for 1 Brick, while still being much better than their current offer. Given my large quantity of Sheep (21) and low quantity of Ore (7), and the general goal to increase overall value, I want to convert low-value Sheep into high-value resources. Brick is a good candidate.\n\nMy previous offer of 1 Sheep for 1 Brick was rejected. This was a 12 value gain for me.\nPlayer 0's offer of 1 Brick for 3 Sheep yields a 22 value loss for me.\nThe difference between us is significant. I need to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me.\n\nLet's try to get 1 Brick (29) by giving 1 Sheep (17) and some Wheat (5).\nIf I offer 1 Sheep (17) + 2 Wheat (10) = 27 value. This would give me 1 Brick (29) with a net gain of 2 (29-27). This is a slim profit, but moves some Wheat, and is still better than any offer Player 0 has made.\nIf I go with 1 Sheep and 1 Wheat: 17 + 5 = 22. This would be a gain of 7 (29-22). This is a good offer. Player 0 rejected 1 Sheep for 1 Brick from me, which was 17 for 29 (gain 12). So an offer of 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat for 1 Brick might be more palatable for Player 0, as they pay less value (29) while receiving 1 Sheep and 1 Wheat (22 total value to me). My gain would be 7.\n\nLet's stick to simple trades first, rather than bundles unless necessary. Player 0 rejected 1 Sheep for 1 Brick. They also rejected 3 Sheep for 2 Brick. They seem very keen on either getting a lot of Sheep for little or they don't value Brick as highly as I do. Given their current offer (1 Brick for 3 Sheep), they see value in getting Sheep.\n\nI need to counter their awful offer (1 Brick for 3 Sheep) with something that still benefits me significantly without being as extreme as 1 Sheep for 1 Brick.\nWhat if I ask for 2 Brick for 3 Sheep?\nMy value: 3 Sheep = 51. Requested value: 2 Brick = 58. Gain = 7.\nPlayer 0 rejected this previously. So they likely won't accept again.\n\nPlayer 0 wants Sheep. I have plenty. I need to reduce my number of Sheep and convert them to higher value resources.\n1 Sheep (17) for 1 Brick (29) is rejected.\n2 Sheep (34) for 1 Brick (29) is a loss for me.\n\nGiven Player 0 consistently offering me Sheep for Brick values that are bad for me, and their last offer even worse (1 Brick FOR 3 Sheep, where they get the Sheep), I should probably try to offer something that extracts profit but doesn't necessarily achieve my maximum desired profit, just to move the needle.\n\nLet me try to trade 2 Sheep for 1 Brick.\nMy quantity of Sheep: 21. Value: 17.\nMy quantity of Brick: 13. Value: 29.\nIf I give 2 Sheep (34 value) for 1 Brick (29 value), I lose 5 value. This is not my goal.\n\nI need to deny their current offer, as it's a massive loss.\nI want to make a trade where I get more value than I give.\nPlayer 0 rejected 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick (my best offer).\nPlayer 0 is currently offering 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep (terrible for me).\n\nThis means Player 0 is highly valuing Sheep.\nI have 21 Sheep.\nHow about I try to get an Ore?\n1 Ore = 32 value.\nIf I give 1 Sheep (17) for 1 Ore (32), I gain 15 value. This is a very good trade.\nIf I give 2 Sheep (34) for 1 Ore (32), I lose 2 value. This is bad.\n\nLet me try offering a larger quantity of my lowest value resource (Wheat) for a Brick, since Player 0 seems interested in trades involving Brick, and my Sheep and Brick are close in value per unit.\nWheat is Value 5. Brick is Value 29.\nTo get 1 Brick, I need to give 6 Wheat (30 value). This is a net loss of 1 for me (29-30).\n5 Wheat (25 value) for 1 Brick (29 value) would be a net gain of 4 for me.\n\nPlayer 0 seems to be trying to get a lot of value for themselves. Given their last offer, they value Sheep highly. I will leverage my high quantity of Sheep and try to get a higher value resource. Ore is the highest value. But previous offers focused on Sheep and Brick.\n\nMy best current option is to try to get a small profit, while giving up one of my many Sheep.\nI will deny Player 0's current offer.\nThen I will make an offer.\n\nWhat's the smallest quantity of Sheep I can offer to get 1 Brick and still make a profit?\n1 Sheep (17) for 1 Brick (29) = +12 profit. (Rejected by P0 previously).\nSince P0 rejected this, they might not see 1 Brick as worth only 1 Sheep.\nBut since they offered to give 1 Brick for 3 Sheep (me giving 3 Sheep for 1 Brick), that means they think 1 Brick is worth 3 Sheep.\nThis implies they are trying to gain Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get a higher value item, like Ore or Wood, in exchange for Sheep, as they desire Sheep.\nOre: Value 32. Wood: Value 12.\nI have 9 Wood, 7 Ore.\nIf I offered 2 Sheep (34 value) for 1 Ore (32 value), it's a loss for me (-2).\nIf I offer 1 Sheep (17 value) for 1 Ore (32 value), it's a gain for me (+15). Player 0 might reject this though, as they might not want to give up an Ore for so little.\n\nLet's maintain focus on Sheep for Brick, as that's where the negotiation has been.\nPlayer 0 is offering 1 Brick (29) for 3 Sheep (51). So they think 1 Brick = 3 Sheep.\nI want 1 Brick (29) for 1 Sheep (17). So *I* think 1 Brick = 1 Sheep.\n\nCan I get 2 Brick for some Sheep?\nI have 21 Sheep.\nIf I give 4 Sheep (68) for 2 Brick (58), I lose 10.\nIf I give 3 Sheep (51) for 2 Brick (58), I gain 7. Player 0 rejected this previously.\n\nPlayer 0 wants Sheep. I will take advantage of this but not at a loss.\nMy resources: Wheat 17 (5), Wood 9 (12), Sheep 21 (17), Brick 13 (29), Ore 7 (32).\n\nI need to calculate a profitable trade that Player 0 might accept, given their desperate need for Sheep.\nI will continue asking for 1 Brick.\nIf I ask for 1 Brick, what should I give?\n1 Sheep (17) is my best, but rejected.\n2 Sheep (34) is a loss.\nSo, I must give less than 29 value to get 1 Brick at a profit using Sheep.\nThe only way to make a profit with Sheep for Brick is if I offer 1 Sheep for 1 Brick. This has been rejected.\nIs there any other resource combination I can offer to get 1 Brick with profit?\nHow about offering Sheep AND Wheat?\nTarget: 1 Brick (29 value).\nOffer: 1 Sheep (17 value) + 2 Wheat (10 value) = 27 value. Net gain of 2 value. This is a very small gain, but still a gain.\nThis may be more appealing to Player 0 who keeps rejecting 1 Sheep for 1 Brick, as they get two resources.\n\nLet's go for that. It allows me to use up some Wheat, which is low value, and still be profitable.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation games, several key principles and strategies are crucial for maximizing the total value of my resources. Here are the most relevant ones based on my current situation:\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: Always evaluate trades based on the net change in value. I should only accept or propose trades where the value of resources I receive exceeds the value of resources I give up. For my resources, the values per unit are: Wheat (6), Wood (12), Sheep (12), Brick (28), and Ore (32). This means I should prioritize keeping or acquiring high-value resources like Brick and Ore while trading away lower-value ones like Wheat or Sheep, ensuring the overall trade results in a positive net value.\n\n2. **Resource Scarcity and Abundance**: Consider my resource quantities and the other player's likely needs. I have abundant Sheep (24 qty) and Brick (20 qty), but Ore is scarcer (10 qty). Trading away abundant, low-value resources (e.g., Sheep or Wheat) for scarce, high-value ones (e.g., Brick) can be strategic, but I must avoid depleting valuable resources. From the history, Player 1 has rejected multiple offers involving Sheep and Brick, suggesting they value Brick highly and may have an excess of Sheep or Wheat.\n\n3. **Negotiation Dynamics**: In a turn-based game with limited turns (10 total), persistence and incremental adjustments are key. The history shows a pattern of rejections, indicating mismatched valuations\u2014Player 1 seems unwilling to trade Brick for Sheep alone. I should use counteroffers to test boundaries, starting with offers that heavily favor me and adjusting slightly if needed. Rejecting unfavorable offers maintains leverage, and making counteroffers can signal flexibility without conceding too much.\n\n4. **Risk and Opportunity Cost**: With only a few turns left (based on the history, we're likely past several turns), I need to weigh the risk of no deal against potential future opportunities. Holding onto high-value resources like Brick could pay off if better trades arise, but stalling might lead to missed chances. Insights from game theory suggest that in repeated interactions, building rapport through fair counteroffers can lead to better long-term outcomes.\n\n5. **Psychological Factors**: Players often anchor on their initial offers. Player 1's offers (e.g., offering Sheep and Wheat for Brick) indicate they might undervalue Brick compared to me. I should respond by countering with offers that highlight the disparity in value, potentially forcing them to sweeten their deal.\n\nThese principles guide me to prioritize value-positive trades, adapt to rejections, and use my resource abundance strategically.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\n\nApplying the above knowledge to the current situation: Player 1 has offered me 1 Sheep and 2 Wheat in exchange for 1 Brick. Let's calculate the net value change:\n\n- Resources I'm receiving: 1 Sheep (value: 12 per unit) + 2 Wheat (value: 6 per unit each) = 12 + (2 * 6) = 12 + 12 = 24 total value.\n- Resources I'm giving: 1 Brick (value: 28 per unit) = 28 total value.\n- Net value change: 24 (gained) - 28 (lost) = -4 value.\n\nThis trade would decrease my total resource value, violating the principle of value maximization. Additionally, based on negotiation dynamics, Player 1's repeated rejections suggest they are not meeting my valuation of Brick, and this offer doesn't address my abundance of Sheep or need for other resources. Holding onto Brick (a high-value, abundant resource for me) minimizes risk, especially with limited turns left.\n\nTherefore, I will deny this offer and make a counteroffer to test if Player 1 is willing to improve their proposal. I'll offer something from my abundant, lower-value resources (like Sheep) in exchange for something more valuable to me, ensuring the trade favors me. Specifically, I'll propose trading 4 Sheep (low value, high quantity) for 1 Brick, as this aligns with past interactions and might prompt a better response.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",

I have fewer Ore. Acquiring more high-value resources is a priority to increase overall value.\n\n5.  **Principle of Mutual Gain (but prioritize self):** While a good trade for the opponent isn't necessarily bad for me, my primary goal is to increase *my* total value. I should aim for disproportionately beneficial trades for myself initially, and be willing to concede less as turns deplete or if I'm stuck.\n\n6.  **Analyze Incoming Offer (4 Sheep -> 1 Brick):**\n    *   Value Offered: 4 Sheep * 17 = 68\n    *   Value Requested: 1 Brick * 29 = 29\n    *   This is a deeply unfavorable trade for me.

However, if they offered it, they might have simply been trying to get rid of Brick or wanted Sheep for a specific purpose.\n\n8.  **Negotiation Strategy:**\n    *   Reject unfavorable offers decisively.\n    *   Make counter-offers that reflect my desired value increase.\n    *   Since I have a lot of Sheep and Wheat, I should continue trying to trade them for Brick or Ore.\n    *   My ideal trade for 1 Brick would be 1 Sheep and some Wheat, or 2-3 Wheat.\n    *   My ideal trade for 1 Ore would be 1-2 Brick, 2-3 Sheep, or 4-5 Wheat.\n\n9.  **Turn Management:** With 10 turns total, and 6 passes already, I have 4 turns left.

      "response": "Below, I'll follow the task instructions step by step. First, I'll generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation based on my current situation. Then, I'll apply that knowledge to make a trading decision. Finally, I'll use the required special tokens to specify my action.\n\n### Generate Knowledge\nBased on my role as a competitive game player in this Negotiation Game, here are the key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are most relevant to my current situation:\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources, so I must evaluate every trade based on my personal resource values. For example, I have per-unit values derived from my total values (e.g., Wheat: 6 total value for 16 units = 0.375 per unit; Sheep: 12 total for 24 units = 0.5 per unit; etc.). I should only propose or accept trades where the value of what I receive exceeds the value of what I give, accounting for quantities. This ensures long-term gains, especially with only 10 turns left.\n\n2. **Negotiation History and Patterns**: From the history, Player 1 consistently rejects offers involving Sheep for Brick, even when I increase the quantity (e.g., my offers of 2 Sheep for 1 Brick, 4 Sheep for 1 Brick, or 1 Brick for 3 Sheep were all rejected). This suggests Player 1 highly values Brick and may have a surplus of Sheep and Wheat, as they've offered those resources multiple times. I should use this to my advantage by proposing trades that align with their needs (e.g., offering Brick) while ensuring I gain value. Persistence with adjusted offers can wear down resistance, but I must avoid overgiving to prevent losses.\n\n3. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: I have abundant Sheep (24 units) and Brick (20 units), making them good candidates for trading, while my Ore is scarce and highly valuable (3.2 per unit), so I should protect it. Player 1 appears to demand Brick, so leveraging my surplus Brick could secure resources I undervalue (e.g., Sheep or Wheat). However, I must demand more of their resources to compensate for the higher value I'm giving up, creating an asymmetrical trade in my favor.\n\n4. **Risk and Turn Management**: With only a few turns remaining (the game has already seen several exchanges), I need to be efficient and avoid prolonged rejections. If an offer is rejected, I should iterate quickly with slight modifications to test boundaries. Rejecting unfavorable deals is crucial, as seen in my past actions, to avoid diminishing my total value. Building a reputation for fair but firm negotiations might encourage future concessions, though in a short game, self-interest dominates.\n\n5. **Trade Structure and Psychology**: Offers should be clear and balanced to appear reasonable, but always tilted toward my benefit. For instance, starting with a slight edge (e.g., gaining 10-20% more value) can lead to acceptance without revealing weakness. If no incoming offer exists, I should initiate to control the pace, as Player 1's last action was inaction.\n\nThese insights emphasize calculated, self-serving trades while adapting to observed behaviors.\n\n### Apply Knowledge\nApplying the above knowledge to my situation:\n\n- My current resources and values: I have a total value of approximately 90 (calculated as Wheat: 6, Wood: 12, Sheep: 12, Brick: 28, Ore: 32). Per-unit values are: Wheat (0.375), Wood (0.8), Sheep (0.5), Brick (1.4), Ore (3.2). I want to increase this total, so I'll focus on trading my surplus (e.g., Brick or Sheep) for resources that provide better value per unit.\n\n- From the history, Player 1 wants Brick but is unwilling to part with Sheep easily, as evidenced by their rejections. My previous offer of 1 Brick for 3 Sheep was rejected, but that trade would have given me 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 value for 1.4 value, a slight gain. To push further, I'll adjust to demand more (e.g., 4 Sheep for 1 Brick), which would give me 4 * 0.5 = 2.0 value for 1.4 value\u2014a net gain of 0.6. This aligns with value maximization and supply/demand, as I have excess Brick and Player 1 has shown interest in it.\n\n- Turn management is critical with limited turns left, so I'll propose a new offer that's an iteration on past ones, testing if Player 1 will concede. If they reject again, I've lost little, but if they accept, I gain value. This avoids risk while maintaining initiative.\n\nBased on this, my trading decision is to make a new offer: Offer 1 Brick in exchange for 4 Sheep. This provides me a clear value gain while targeting Player 1's apparent needs.\n\n### Trading Decision\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 4 Sheep]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: Based on the current situation and past turns:\n\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase total resource value. This means trading away lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or trading fewer units of higher value for more units of similar value (if a net gain).\n    *   Current Values (per unit): Wheat (5), Wood (12), Sheep (17), Brick (29), Ore (32).\n    *   Target: Acquire Brick and Ore, dispose of Wheat, Wood, Sheep.\n\n2.  **Tracking Past Offers and Rejections (Player 0's Behavior):**\n    *   Player 0 has repeatedly offered Sheep for Brick (4 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 4 Sheep). This indicates Player 0 values Brick highly and is willing to trade Sheep for it, or they have a surplus of Sheep.\n    *   Player 0 rejected: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick. This suggests Player 0 wants a *better* deal for their Brick or values Sheep differently than I do in those specific ratios.\n    *   It seems Player 0 sees 1 Brick as roughly equivalent to 3-4 Sheep, or possibly slightly more, as they offered 1 Brick for 4 Sheep (a good deal for me) but I rejected (due to the setup of me making the offer/rejecting it - this is confusing in the prompt, I need to interpret it as Player 0 *offered* 1 Brick for 4 Sheep, and I *received* it, but my prior action caused a rejection).\n\n3.  **My Past Offers and Rejections:**\n    *   My rejections of P0's offers of 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 4 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep, 1 Brick -> 4 Sheep shows I was looking for a better ratio for the Brick, or maybe thought I could get more Brick for less Sheep. However, the last rejection (1 Brick -> 4 Sheep) was *my* rejection of a good offer from P0. This is an error in my past strategy or the prompt's flow. *Self-correction: I should have accepted 1 Brick for 4 Sheep if my goal is to gain value.*\n\n4.  **Optimal Trade Ratios (from my perspective):**\n    *   1 Brick (29) is worth 1.7 Sheep (29 / 17). So, 1 Brick for 2 Sheep is a fair trade for Player 0, slightly unfavorable for me. 1 Brick for 1 Sheep is excellent for me. 1 Brick for 3 Sheep is unfavorable for me. 1 Brick for 4 Sheep is very unfavorable for me.\n    *   Conversely, getting 1 Brick (29) for a cheaper resource like Wheat (5) or Wood (12) would be ideal.\n    *   Player 0's offer of \"1 Brick -> 4 Sheep\" means P0 gives 1 Brick (value 29) and I give 4 Sheep (value 4 * 17 = 68). **This is a terrible trade for me.** My previous rejections of P0's offers of 4 Sheep -> 1 Brick were correct. My *rejection* of Player 0's offer of \"1 Brick -> 4 Sheep\" was also correct. The confusing prompt phrasing \"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 1 Brick -> Requested items: 4 Sheep\" means P0 *gives* 1 Brick, and *wants* 4 Sheep. This is a very bad deal for me.\n\n5.  **Current State:**\n    *   I have a lot of Sheep (21). This is a moderately valuable resource that Player 0 seems interested in exchanging for Brick.\n    *   I want more Brick and Ore. I have some Brick (13) and Ore (7), but their value is high.\n    *   I have Wheat (17) which is low value.\n    *   I have Wood (9) which is also low value.\n\n6.  **Negotiation Strategy:**\n    *   Player 0 consistently targets Sheep for Brick, and often proposes unfavorable ratios for me (e.g., 4 Sheep for 1 Brick).\n    *   I need to propose deals that are favorable to me (Value of offered resources < Value of requested resources initially, or at least break-even).\n    *   Since Player 0 is *offering* Brick, I should try to get Brick for less valuable resources than Sheep, or for fewer Sheep than they are asking for.\n    *   Given P0's willingness to give 1 Brick for 4 Sheep, they value Sheep more than I do, or they are desperate for Sheep. I should exploit this.\n    *   My previous offer of \"1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick\" (value 17 + 10 = 27 for value 29) was a good deal for me, but it was rejected.\n\n**Refocused Strategy for this turn:**\n*   **Goal:** Acquire more Brick or Ore.\n*   **Leverage:** I have a lot of Sheep that Player 0 seems interested in. I also have lower value Wheat.\n*   **P0's last offer:** 1 Brick for *my* 4 Sheep (P0 offers Brick, wants my Sheep). This is a bad deal for me (gain 29 value, lose 68 value). So I will continue to reject similar offers or counter with much better ratios.\n*   **My Counter-Offer:** Player 0 consistently undervalues Brick in their offers (from my perspective) by asking for too much in return (e.g., 4 Sheep). I need to offer something that is *slightly* tempting for them, given their apparent need for Sheep, but still favorable to me.\n*   I want Brick. Player 0 has offered Brick. The last offer (1 Brick for 4 Sheep) indicates *they* are willing to give up Brick for Sheep. I need to make a counter that's much better for me.\n*   A previous rejection was \"1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick\". Value from my side: 17 + 10 = 27. Value from their side: 29. This was good for me. Since they rejected it, I need to either offer more value or change the resources.\n*   Given Player 0 consistently asks for a lot of Sheep for Brick, they might be willing to accept fewer Sheep, especially if I can package it with Wheat.\n*   Let's consider what might be acceptable to P0 based on their past offers (e.g., they thought 1 Brick was worth 3-4 Sheep).\n    *   My target: 1 Brick for 1 Sheep (value 17 for 29, +12 value for me) - perhaps too aggressive.\n    *   How about 2 Sheep for 1 Brick? (value 34 for 29, -5 value for me, but maybe they accept if desperate for sheep). No, this is bad for me.\n    *   What if I offer a mix, still trying to get a good deal? My Wheat is useless.\n    *   Current P0 offer: 1 Brick -> 4 Sheep (P0 GIVES Brick, I GIVE Sheep). This is still the offer on the table. It is terrible for me. Value gain: 29. Value loss: 4 * 17 = 68. Net -39. I must reject this.\n    *   Since the prompt explicitly states \"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 1 Brick -> Requested items: 4 Sheep\", and my instructions are to make a decision *after* reading this, I need to decide on THIS specific offer.\n\nGiven Player 0's offer of \"1 Brick -> 4 Sheep\" (P0 gives 1 Brick, wants 4 Sheep), this is a net loss of 39 value for me (29 value gain - 68 value loss). I *must* reject this.\n\nAfter rejecting, I need to make a new offer that is beneficial to me.\nMy previous offer of \"1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick\" was rejected. I need to entice Player 0.\nPlayer 0 has consistently shown interest in Sheep. They also seem willing to give Brick up, but want a lot for it.\n\nLet's try to get Brick for cheap. Maybe 1 Sheep for 1 Brick is too aggressive, as rejected before.\nHow about a slightly less favorable deal *for me* than 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat, but still good value? Or simply more Sheep given their interest?\n\nPlayer 0's initial offer was 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick. My value lost: (2*17) = 34. Their value gained: 29. Unfavorable for me.\nMy counter was 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick. My value lost: (3*17) = 51. Their value gained: (2*29) = 58. Favorable for me (+7). Rejected.\nMy counter was 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick. My value lost: 17. Their value gained: 29. Favorable for me (+12). Rejected.\n\nIt seems I've been too aggressive, or P0 is extremely stubborn.\nP0's latest offer, 1 Brick for 4 Sheep, is horrible for me.\n\nI have a large quantity of Wheat. Let's try to offload some of that with a small amount of Sheep, for Brick.\nPlayer 0 rejected 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick, which had me giving 27 value for 29 value.\nWhat if I give them *more* Sheep than 1, but still make it a good deal for me?\nIf they think 1 Brick is worth 3-4 Sheep, then 2 Sheep should be good for 1 Brick for them (34 value for 29 value). This is bad for me.\nI need to reverse their logic. I want Brick, they want Sheep.\nI need to offer less than 3 Sheep for 1 Brick.\n\nConsider: P0 offered 1 Brick for 4 Sheep (P0 GETS 4 Sheep, GIVES 1 Brick). This offer is terrible: My loss 68, My gain 29. I reject.\nNow, my turn to offer.\n\nLet's try to give them something they value (Sheep) but still get a good return.\nA very slightly bad deal for them, but good for me.\n1 Brick is 29 value.\n1 Sheep is 17 value.\nI want to give < 29 value for 1 Brick.\nOffer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood (17 + 12 = 29) -> 1 Brick (29). This is value-neutral for me, but gets rid of Wood (lower priority) for Brick (higher priority). P0 might see it as fair.\nHowever, P0 seems obsessed with Sheep.\n\nLet's stick to Sheep + Wheat, as Player 0 might not want Wood.\nWhat about offering 1 Sheep and 3 Wheat? (17 + 15 = 32) for 1 Brick (29). This is *slightly* unfavorable for me (-3 value), but it converts Wheat (lowest value) to Brick (high value) and gets rid of Sheep. It might finally get a trade through.\nMy current high quantities are Sheep (21) and Wheat (17). I want to shed these.\n\nLet's look at the failed \"1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick\" (my value 27 for P0's 29 value).\nWhat if I try to offer just Sheep, but a low amount? I offered 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick, rejected.\nPlayer 0 valued 1 Brick at 3-4 Sheep. If I offer 2 Sheep, then it's 34 value for me getting 29 value. Bad.\n\nWhat if I ask for 2 Brick? My prior offer of 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick (51 value for 58 value) was good for me and rejected.\nPerhaps P0's internal valuation *of my specific resources* is different.\n\nMy focus should be to get high value resources.\nP0 is offering Brick for Sheep. This is a clear path.\nThe current P0 offer (1 Brick for 4 Sheep) is bad. I reject.\nMy problem: I keep making offers that are good for me but rejected, or rejecting offers that are bad for me. I need to find a sweet spot.\n\nIf 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat for 1 Brick was rejected, it means P0 needs more \"value\" or different resources based on their internal metrics.\nMaybe P0 sees my Wheat as worthless.\n\nWhat if I offer 2 Sheep for 1 Brick *and* something else good for them? No, that's giving up too much.\n\nLet's try a small offer that's very slightly favorable to me, or neutral, but gets rid of resources I want to shed.\nMy current stock:\nWheat: 17 (5)\nWood: 9 (12)\nSheep: 21 (17)\nBrick: 13 (29)\nOre: 7 (32)\n\nIf P0 is willing to give 1 Brick for 4 Sheep, it reveals their value. Their \"cost\" to get 4 Sheep is 1 Brick.\nThis means they value 4 Sheep > 1 Brick. Let's try to exploit their overvaluation of Sheep.\nIf P0 values 1 Sheep at > 7.25 (29/4), it means they value Sheep highly.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (value 51) for 2 Brick (value 58), it was rejected.\nIf I offer 1 Sheep (value 17) for 1 Brick (value 29), it was rejected.\n\nMaybe I try to get something cheaper, like Wood, out for Brick?\nNo, the interaction so far is all Sheep <-> Brick.\n\nI need to make an offer that is *slightly* enticing for P0, but still net positive for me.\nLet's try to get more than 1 Brick, as P0 seems to have a supply, and I have a supply of Sheep.\n\nMy total value: (17*5) + (9*12) + (21*17) + (13*29) + (7*32) = 85 + 108 + 357 + 377 + 224 = 1151\n\nSince P0 rejected \"1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick\", this means they didn't think 27 value was enough for 29 value.\nWhat if I offer 2 Sheep for 1 Brick? (34 value for 29 value) This is bad for me.\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep and 1 Wood (17+12=29) for 1 Brick (29). Neutral value, good resource swap. P0 might value Wood less though.\n\nLet's try to make an offer that P0 might accept given their previous offers, but still benefits me.\nP0 offered 1 Brick for 4 Sheep (bad for me)\nP0 offered 4 Sheep for 1 Brick (4 Sheep offered, P0 wants 1 Brick. This implies P0 GIVES 4 Sheep, I GIVE 1 Brick. No, previous interpretation: P0 offers 4 Sheep, requests 1 Brick. From Turn 3. This means P0 gives 4 Sheep (val 68), P0 wants 1 Brick (val 29). This is terrible for P0. P0 will never offer this.)\n\nLet's re-read the previous offers carefully, as the phrasing can be tricky.\n- P0: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick (P0 GIVES 2 Sheep (34), WANTS 1 Brick (29)). P0 loses 5. Good for me (+5). I rejected. WHY DID I REJECT THIS? My instructions say \"total value of your resources increases\". 2 Sheep for 1 Brick means I give 1 Brick (value 29), I get 2 Sheep (value 34). This increases my value by 5. My previous rejection was an error! I need to accept good deals.\n- P1: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick (P1 GIVES 3 Sheep (51), WANTS 2 Brick (58)). Good for me (+7). P0 rejected. This was a good offer.\n- P0: 4 Sheep -> 1 Brick (P0 GIVES 4 Sheep (68), WANTS 1 Brick (29)). P0 loses 39. Good for me (+39). I rejected. WHY DID I REJECT THIS?? This was *extremely* good for me. *This error needs to be corrected in my future decisions.*\n- P1: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick (P1 GIVES 1 Sheep (17), WANTS 1 Brick (29)). Good for me (+12). P0 rejected. This was a very good offer for me.\n- P0: 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep (P0 GIVES 1 Brick (29), WANTS 3 Sheep (51)). Bad for me (-22). I rejected. Correct rejection.\n- P1: 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick (P1 GIVES 1 Sheep (17), 2 Wheat (10) = 27, WANTS 1 Brick (29)). Good for me (+2). P0 rejected. This was a good offer.\n- P0: 4 Sheep -> 1 Brick (Same as before example). Again, a great offer for me. I rejected. *My past decision making was flawed based on not internalizing the value change correctly.*\n\n**CRITICAL RE-EVALUATION:** My past rejections of P0's offers of \"X Sheep -> 1 Brick\" (meaning P0 gives Sheep, wants Brick) were financially poor decisions. P0 was literally offering me value for free. I should have accepted them.\n\n**Current P0 Offer: 1 Brick -> 4 Sheep**\nThis means Player 0 GIVES 1 Brick (value 29) and REQUESTS 4 Sheep (value 4 * 17 = 68).\nMy value change: +29 (Brick) - 68 (Sheep) = -39.\nThis specific offer is BAD for me. My rejection of this one was correct.\n\nSo, for *this specific turn*, the immediate decision is whether to accept or decline \"1 Brick -> 4 Sheep\". I decline.\n\nNow, I need to make *my* offer. Given P0's history of making offers that are *very good for me*, but also my own rejected good offers, I need to find a balance.\nIt seems P0 has Sheep they want to get rid of, or is extremely desperate for Brick.\nThe problem is Player 0 offers THEIR Sheep and wants MY Brick. No, that's not right based on past moves:\n\"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 2 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Brick\" implies P0 is BUYING Brick by OFFERING Sheep.\nThis implies P0 wants my Brick and is willing to pay Sheep for it.\n\nOk, let's take the latest offer: \"1 Brick -> 4 Sheep\".\nThis offer is FROM P0. P0 is OFFERING 1 Brick. P0 is REQUESTING 4 Sheep.\nMy perspective: I RECEIVE 1 Brick (value +29). I GIVE 4 Sheep (value -68).\nNet change: -39. This is absolutely a bad deal for me. I will reject.\n\nNow, what is my offer to P0?\nP0 has offered me good deals in the past that I mistakenly rejected (e.g. \"4 Sheep -> 1 Brick\" where P0 offers 4 Sheep and wants 1 Brick).\nP0 seems to want my Brick. I value Brick highly, so I don't want to sell it unless it's a huge gain.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick from P0, as they seem to have some they are willing to trade.\nP0 offered: 1 Brick for my 4 Sheep. That's a bad exchange for me.\nMy own offers for Brick using Sheep were rejected.\n\nLet's exploit P0's apparent interest in getting my Brick.\nI have a lot of Sheep. P0 is willing to give Brick for my Sheep (bad ratio for me).\nWhat if I offer resources I want to get rid of (Wheat) plus some of Sheep for Brick?\nP0 rejected \"1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick\" where I gave 27 value for 29 value. This was good for me.\n\nMaybe Player 0 doesn't value Wheat, or they perceive the value differently.\nLet's offer a combination that is slightly better for Player 0 than my last offer, but still good for me.\nPerhaps I can get 2 Brick for some Sheep.\nMy value for 2 Brick is 58.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (51), gains 7.\nIf I offer 4 Sheep (68), loses 10.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep for 2 Brick and P0 rejected, they wanted more from me for 2 Brick.\nBut P0 also offered 1 Brick for 4 Sheep (my loss of 39). So they are trying to get a huge gain from me.\n\nI need to make a tempting offer for P0 that is beneficial to me.\nSince P0's strategy is currently to ask for a lot of Sheep for their Brick, I need to offer less.\nWhat if I try to get Ore? Or trade away Wheat?\nP0's consistent focus is Brick <-> Sheep. I will stick to this.\n\nI want to acquire Brick. I have Sheep.\nP0 offers 1 Brick, wants 4 Sheep. (P0 profit -39 value for me). This is rejected.\nSo, I should offer OUT my Sheep, and ask for Brick.\n\nLet's make a clear bid. I will offer a ratio of Sheep for Brick that is slightly better for P0 than my ideal, but still net positive for me.\nIf P0 values 1 Brick for 3-4 Sheep, let's aim for 1 Brick for 2 Sheep but maybe something small else.\nMy ideal: 1 Brick for 1 Sheep (gain +12). Rejected. What about 1 of my low value for 1 of their high value?\n1 Brick (29) divided by 1 Sheep (17) is ~1.7. So, 1 Brick for 2 Sheep is 29 vs 34, a loss of 5 for me. Do NOT offer this.\nI should not give more than 1 Sheep per Brick.\n\nMy last offer for Brick (\"1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick\") gave 27 value for 29 value, +2 for me. It was rejected.\nTo make it more tempting for P0, I could slightly increase the value I offer.\nSay, add 1 more Wheat? \"1 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick\" (17 + 15 = 32 for 29). This is a loss of 3 for me. Not good.\n\nPerhaps I can offer 2 Wood (24) for 1 Brick (29). Good for me (+5). Gets rid of Wood. Might be rejected if P0 doesn't need Wood.\nGiven P0's focus on Sheep, I should include Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get Ore. Ore is very high value (32).\nIf I offered 2 Sheep (34) for 1 Ore (32), I'd lose 2 value. Not good.\nHow about 1 Sheep, 1 Wood (17+12=29) for 1 Ore (32)? Gain 3. P0 might have Ore.\nThis moves away from the Sheep-Brick focus, but addresses my value goal.\n\nHowever, adherence to the established negotiation pattern is key. P0 keeps offering Sheep for Brick. I should focus on Brick.\nP0 has offered 1 Brick FOR 4 Sheep (meaning P0 gives 1 Brick, gets 4 Sheep: bad for me).\nP0 has also offered 4 Sheep FOR 1 Brick (meaning P0 gives 4 Sheep, gets 1 Brick: good for me).\n\nThis is crucial. The inconsistent phrasing of P0's offers from previous turns is super confusing.\nLet's assume the latest turn's phrasing is the consistent one.\n\"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 1 Brick -> Requested items: 4 Sheep\"\nThis means OFFERED for P0 is 1 Brick. REQUESTED for P0 is 4 Sheep.\nThis implies P0 *wants* 4 Sheep, and is *paying* 1 Brick for them.\n\nMy response to that specific offer: Deny. (As calculated, -39 value gain).\n\nMy new offer: I need to ask for their Brick, since they are willing to give it up (even if for an absurd price).\nI will OFFER Sheep, and/or Wheat, REQUESTING Brick.\n\nI failed last time with \"1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick\" (+2 value for me).\nTo make it more attractive to P0 (and hopefully reduce rejections):\nI must give *more* value than 27.\nHow about: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick. (34 value for 29 value). This is -5 for me. I gain a high-value resource but lose total value. This breaks my core rule.\n\nI must *gain* total value.\nI have Wheat and Sheep to spare, and they are lower value than Brick.\nIf I offer 2 Wheat (10) for 1 Wood (12), that's +2 for me. P0 might not want Wheat.\n\nLet's continue on the Sheep-Brick axis due to P0's stated preference.\nI offered 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick and it was rejected. Value gain +2.\nCan I offer slightly more, but still gain?\nFor example, if I offer 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat for 1 Brick? (17 + 5 = 22 vs 29). Gain +7. This is even better for me than the rejected one. P0 will likely reject this too.\n\nI need to make an offer that is *perceived* by P0 as reasonable, while still gaining value.\nPerhaps P0 just wants *volume* of resources, or specifically *Sheep*.\nThe fact that P0 offered 1 Brick for 4 Sheep suggests they are really after the Sheep.\n\nI will try to make a profitable trade.\nOffer: 2 Wood (value 24) -> Request: 1 Brick (value 29). My value increases by 5.\nThis relies on P0 valuing Wood. It gets rid of a medium-value resource for a high-value one.\nThis does not follow the Sheep/Brick pattern strictly, but it's a good deal for me if P0 accepts.\n\nGiven the past P0 offers of \"X Sheep -> 1 Brick\" where X=2 or X=4, it signals P0 might be trying to offload Sheep. No, the prompt reads \"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 2 Sheep -> Requested items: 1 Brick\".\nThis means P0 is BUYING MY BRICK WITH THEIR SHEEP.\nIf this is the case, then ME rejecting those incredibly favorable trades (P0 gives 4 Sheep for MY 1 Brick) was incredibly stupid. I need to accept such offers IF they come again.\n\nThe current offer is: P0 offers 1 Brick, requests 4 Sheep. Still a bad deal for me. I reject.\n\nLet's assume the previous phrasing \"P0 offered items: X Sheep -> Requested items: Y Brick\" means P0 is giving X Sheep to get Y Brick.\nIf P0 offers 4 Sheep and wants 1 Brick: I give 1 Brick (29), I get 4 Sheep (68). Net +39. THIS IS A FANTASTIC DEAL FOR ME. I should have accepted it.\n\nMy new offer. I will explicitly try to get a good deal that increases my value.\nI want to get Brick or Ore. I have plenty of Wheat and Sheep.\nP0 is willing to give Brick for Sheep (even at bad ratios for them, as per MY REJECTIONS of their *good* offers). I need to capitalize on this.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep for 1 Brick again? (Value +12 for me). P0 rejected this.\nWhat if I offer 1 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Brick? (5+12=17 for 29). Value +12. P0 won't accept if they didn't accept 1 Sheep.\n\nI will offer a trade that is mathematically favorable for me, and tries to get rid of lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\nPlayer 0 seems desperate for Sheep based on their earlier offers (if interpreted correctly: offering 4 Sheep for my 1 Brick).\nIf this is true, I should offer a *small* amount of Sheep for Brick, or use Wheat to get Brick.\n\nLet's try to get 2 Brick for Sheep, as previous 3 Sheep for 2 Brick was rejected.\nValue needed for 2 Brick: 58.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (51), I gain 7. P0 rejected this.\nTo make it more tempting for P0, I could offer 4 Sheep (68). This is a loss of 10 for me. Bad.\n\nI must adhere to \"total value of your resources increases\".\nI need to offer less value than I receive.\n\nMy strategy will be to make a small, but still advantageous, offer for Brick, assuming P0 is still interested in trading.\nCurrent values: Wheat (5), Wood (12), Sheep (17), Brick (29), Ore (32).\n\nOffer: 1 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick\nMy offer value: (1 * 5) + (1 * 12) = 17\nRequested value: (1 * 29) = 29\nValue gain for me: +12. This is the same gain as 1 Sheep for 1 Brick.\nAdvantages: Gets rid of low-value resources. Good for me.\nDisadvantages: P0 has focused on Sheep. P0 might not want Wheat/Wood.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"P0 offered Brick, wants Sheep\" pattern:\nPlayer 0 offered items: 1 Brick -> Requested items: 4 Sheep. This means P0 is selling Brick for Sheep.\nThis implies P0 wants my Sheep.\nMy counter should involve giving them Sheep, but at a better ratio for me.\n\nIf P0 values 1 Brick as 4 Sheep (29 value source for P0, 68 value for P0 to get).\nThen P0 thinks 1 Sheep is worth 29/4 = 7.25 value.\nI value Sheep at 17. So P0 undervalues Sheep significantly, or just needs them.\n\nI will offer Sheep for Brick, but at a ratio that helps me.\nI will offer 1 Sheep for 1 Brick. This was rejected earlier, but I'll try again as it's the optimal for me in terms of Sheep for Brick. It generates +12 value.\n\nIf P0 is willing to lose 39 value (giving 1 Brick worth 29, getting 4 Sheep worth 68), then perhaps 1 Sheep for 1 Brick is actually acceptable. My prior rejections might have confused the bot into thinking I want an even better deal.\n\nFinal consideration: The game has been running for 9 turns without a successful trade. This means I (and potentially P0) have been too stubborn or misinterpreting offers. My past self was making terrible decisions by rejecting value-gaining offers. My goal is to *increase value*.\n\nI need to make an offer that is profitable for me and might tempt P0 given their apparent need for Sheep.\nOffer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick.\nMy value given: 17. My value received: 29. Net gain: +12.\nThis is the best value trade I can make for a single Brick using a single Sheep. It was rejected before, but maybe P0's desperate.\n\nWhat if P0 just wants *any* sheep?\nOffer 2 Sheep for 2 Brick? (34 value for 58 value). Gain +24. This is an excellent deal for me. P0 already rejected \"3 Sheep -> 2 Brick\" which was also a good deal for me.\nThe \"1 Sheep -> 1 Brick\" is simpler and aligns more closely with P0's focus on Sheep/Brick.\n\nReject the current dreadful offer. Then propose my own.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"Deny\"\n}\n```",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nAs a competitive player in the Negotiation Game, I must focus on key principles of resource trading and negotiation to maximize the total value of my resources. Here are the most relevant insights based on my current situation:\n\n1. **Value-Based Trading**: Always evaluate trades based on your own resource valuations to ensure that the net value gained (value of resources received minus value of resources given) is positive. For instance, my resources have the following per-unit values: Wheat (6), Wood (12), Sheep (12), Brick (28), and Ore (32). I should only propose or accept trades where the total value I receive exceeds what I give, aiming to trade abundant, lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n2. **Mutual Benefit and Opponent Analysis**: Successful negotiations require offers that provide value to both parties. From the trade history, Player 1 consistently offers Sheep and Wheat while requesting Brick, indicating they value Brick highly and likely have an abundance of Sheep and Wheat. I should adjust offers to align with their preferences (e.g., providing Brick) while ensuring I gain more value in return. If my offers are repeatedly rejected, as in this case, I need to incrementally sweeten them or test boundaries without overcommitting.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics**: In a limited-turn game (only 10 turns total), persistence with adjustments is key, but avoid unfavorable deals. Strategies include starting with aggressive offers and gradually conceding, using scarcity to my advantage (e.g., I have plenty of Sheep and Brick but limited Ore), and avoiding patterns that show weakness. If no counteroffer is made, take the initiative to propose something that tests the other player's limits based on past rejections.\n\n4. **Risk and Turn Management**: With turns dwindling, prioritize trades that could end in agreement to build value quickly. Reject or propose offers that minimize risk\u2014e.g., trading resources I have in surplus (like Sheep or Brick) for ones that increase my overall portfolio. Historical rejections (e.g., my offers of Sheep for Brick were denied) suggest Player 1 may undervalue Sheep relative to Brick, so I need to flip the script by offering Brick for more Sheep than before.\n\n5. **Psychological Insights**: Players often reject offers that don't feel equitable. By proposing trades that build on rejected ones (e.g., reducing what I request), I can signal flexibility without compromising my goal, potentially leading to acceptance in future turns.\n\nThese principles are crucial here, as the history shows a deadlock\u2014Player 1 rejects my Brick-for-Sheep offers, and I've rejected theirs because they don't increase my total value (e.g., their last offer of 1 Sheep and 2 Wheat for 1 Brick gives me only 24 value for 28 given).\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\n\nApplying the above knowledge, I analyze my current resources and the trade history. My total value is calculated as: Wheat (16 \u00d7 6 = 96), Wood (15 \u00d7 12 = 180), Sheep (24 \u00d7 12 = 288), Brick (20 \u00d7 28 = 560), and Ore (10 \u00d7 32 = 320), for a grand total of 1444. I want to increase this by trading surplus resources like Brick (which I have 20 of) for resources that provide higher net value, such as more Sheep, given Player 1's apparent abundance of them.\n\nFrom the history, Player 1 has rejected my previous offer of 1 Brick for 4 Sheep, suggesting they might need a slightly better deal. I'll propose an adjusted offer: 1 Brick for 3 Sheep. This gives me 3 Sheep (3 \u00d7 12 = 36 value) in exchange for 1 Brick (28 value), resulting in a net gain of 8 value for me. It also aligns with Player 1's interest in Brick while being a slight concession from my last offer, potentially breaking the deadlock. If rejected, I'll have more data for future adjustments, but this maintains my focus on mutual benefit and value maximization.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep]",
