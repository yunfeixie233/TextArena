      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade must result in a net gain in value.\n2.  **Scarcity and Demand:** Resources with higher individual values (Ore, Brick, Sheep, Wood, Wheat in descending order) are generally more desirable. My own quantity of a resource affects its internal value to me (e.g., if I have too much Wheat, its marginal value might be lower).\n3.  **Liquidity:** Some resources might be easier to trade due to widespread demand or lower individual value (e.g., Wheat, Wood). Higher value items like Ore and Brick might be harder to get without offering significant value in return.\n4.  **Player 0's Offer Analysis:** Player 0 is offering 5 Wheat (Value: 5 * 5 = 25) and 3 Wood (Value: 3 * 10 = 30). Total offered value = 55. Player 0 is requesting 2 Brick (Value: 2 * 27 = 54) and 1 Ore (Value: 1 * 36 = 36).

This is unacceptable given the objective of increasing total value.\n6.  **Strategic Denial:** Since the current offer is detrimental, I must deny it.\n7.  **Formulating Counter-Offers:** After denying, I should consider what I want and what I'm willing to give up based on my current inventory and value goals. I have a lot of Wheat and Sheep, which are relatively low in value compared to Brick and Ore. I have a good amount of high-value Ore and Brick. I should aim to acquire more high-value resources while giving up less valuable ones, or a smaller quantity of high-value ones for a significantly higher quantity/value in return.\n\nDeny",

      "response": "To tackle this task, let's first analyze the current situation and generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation.\n\n### Current Situation Analysis\n\n1. **Resources and Values**:\n   - Wheat: 21 units, Value = 6\n   - Wood: 17 units, Value = 8\n   - Sheep: 18 units, Value = 15\n   - Brick: 15 units, Value = 28\n   - Ore: 10 units, Value = 40\n\n2. **Total Value**: To understand the current total value, we calculate it as follows:\n   - Total Value = (21*6) + (17*8) + (18*15) + (15*28) + (10*40)\n   - Total Value = 126 + 136 + 270 + 420 + 400 = 1352\n\n3. **Previous Actions**:\n   - Player 0 offered 5 Wheat, 3 Wood for 2 Brick, 1 Ore to Player 1.\n   - Player 1 rejected this offer.\n   - Player 1 made no new trade offer.\n\n### Generating Knowledge\n\n1. **Principle of Value Maximization**: The goal is to increase the total value of resources. Trading resources of lower value for those of higher value is beneficial.\n\n2. **Understanding Player 1's Decision**: Since Player 1 rejected the offer, it implies that the requested resources (2 Brick, 1 Ore) were likely more valuable to them than the offered resources (5 Wheat, 3 Wood), or they didn't have the requested resources to give.\n\n3. **Resource Valuation**: Ore is the most valuable resource per unit (Value = 40), followed by Brick (Value = 28), Sheep (Value = 15), Wood (Value = 8), and Wheat (Value = 6).\n\n4. **Negotiation Strategies**:\n   - Offer resources that are less valuable to you but potentially more valuable or needed by the other player.\n   - Request resources that are more valuable or needed by you.\n   - Consider the quantity and the total value in trades.\n\n5. **Analyzing the Rejected Offer**: The rejected offer was 5 Wheat (Value = 30), 3 Wood (Value = 24) for 2 Brick (Value = 56), 1 Ore (Value = 40). The total value offered was 54, and the total value requested was 96. The trade was favorable (since 96 > 54), but still rejected. This indicates that either Player 1 didn't have the resources to offer or didn't see the trade as beneficial.\n\n### Applying the Knowledge\n\nGiven that the previous offer was rejected and no counteroffer was made by Player 1, we need to reassess and potentially adjust our strategy.\n\n1. **Re-evaluate Resources**: We still have a good quantity of all resources. We should look to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n2. **New Offer Consideration**: \n   - We could offer resources like Wheat and Wood (lower value) for Brick and Ore (higher value).\n   - Alternatively, consider offering Sheep (Value = 15) for Ore or Brick, as it's more valuable than Wheat and Wood but less than Brick and Ore.\n\n3. **Potential Trade**:\n   - Let's consider a trade that involves giving away some Wheat and Wood for Ore. For instance, offering 8 Wheat (Value = 48), 4 Wood (Value = 32) for 2 Ore (Value = 80). The total value offered is 80, and the total value received is 80. This trade maintains the total value but could be adjusted based on negotiation.\n   - A more favorable trade could be offering 5 Sheep (Value = 75) for 2 Ore (Value = 80), as it slightly increases our total value.\n\n### Trading Decision\n\nLet's propose a new trade that is potentially more appealing or balanced:\n\n`[Offer: 5 Sheep, 4 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]`\n\n- Offered: 5 Sheep (Value = 75), 4 Wood (Value = 32) = Total Value of 107\n- Requested: 2 Brick (Value = 56), 1 Ore (Value = 40) = Total Value of 96\n\nThis trade is slightly less favorable in terms of total value (since 96 < 107), but it could be considered if we believe it's likely to be accepted and we are trying to get more Ore.\n\nAlternatively, considering the value maximization principle:\n\n`[Offer: 8 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Brick]`\n\n- Offered: 8 Wheat (Value = 48), 4 Wood (Value = 32) = Total Value of 80\n- Requested: 3 Brick (Value = 84)\n\nThis trade slightly increases our total value (since 84 > 80), making it a potentially good negotiation.\n\nLet's go with: `[Offer: 8 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Brick]`\n\nThis decision aims to increase the total value of our resources while considering the negotiation dynamics and the resources available.",

This means evaluating every trade based on whether the value of resources received exceeds the value of resources given up.\n2.  **Resource Analysis (My Inventory):**\n    *   **Wheat:** Qty: 16, Value: 5 (Low value per unit, high quantity. Good for trading away if the return is high value per unit.)\n    *   **Wood:** Qty: 5, Value: 10 (Medium-low value, low quantity. Potentially useful for smaller trades.)\n    *   **Sheep:** Qty: 13, Value: 14 (Medium value, good quantity. Potentially tradeable.)\n    *   **Brick:** Qty: 7, Value: 27 (High value, medium quantity. Valuable. Should be wary of trading too much away unless for even higher value-per-unit resources.)\n    *   **Ore:** Qty: 12, Value: 36 (Highest value, good quantity. Most valuable resource. Should be very careful about trading this away.)\n3.  **Evaluating Opponent's Needs/Strategy (Inferred):** Player 0 previously requested Brick and Ore. This suggests they value these resources highly. They are consistent in requesting them. This means I have leverage if I decide to trade these, but also I should command a high price for them.\n4.  **Current Offer Analysis:** Player 0 is offering 5 Sheep (Value: 5 * 14 = 70) and 4 Wood (Value: 4 * 10 = 40). Total value offered: 70 + 40 = 110. Player 0 is requesting 2 Brick (Value: 2 * 27 = 54) and 1 Ore (Value: 1 * 36 = 36). Total value requested: 54 + 36 = 90.\n5.  **Profitability Check:** The offered value (110) is greater than the requested value (90). This trade is profitable in terms of raw value.\n6.  **Resource Mix Consideration:** I have a decent quantity of Sheep (13) and a low quantity of Wood (5). Gaining more Sheep and Wood (especially Wood, as it's low quantity for me) at the cost of high-value Brick and Ore is generally not ideal, even if it's value-positive on paper, because it dilutes my high-value resources. However, the value offered is significantly higher than value requested.\n7.  **Negotiation Stance:** Player 0 seems persistent in getting Brick and Ore. I can potentially accept this, or make a counter-offer that gives less high-value resources or demands even more back. Given that I have 7 Brick and 12 Ore, giving up 2 Brick and 1 Ore for a 20-value profit is a reasonable move to increase my overall wealth without critically depleting my highest value resources.\n8.  **Turn Count:** We are still early (Turn 2, if assuming first turn was the rejection). There are 8 more turns to play. Making a profitable trade early can build a stronger base.\n\nTrading Decision:\nThe current offer from Player 0 is economically favorable. I gain 110 value for 90 value given up, representing a profit of 20 value. While giving up Brick and Ore is not ideal for their strategic value, the monetary gain is clear. Given my current quantities of Brick (7) and Ore (12), this trade doesn't critically deplete my stock. I can afford this profitable exchange.\n\n[Accept]",

This helps identify what you are willing to trade away cheaply and what you want to acquire for high value.\n3.  **Identify Surplus/Deficit (Strategic Resource):** You have a good quantity of Wheat and Sheep (lower value), and decent quantities of Wood, Brick, and Ore (higher value). Your goal is to increase total value. This means acquiring more high-value resources (Ore, Brick) by trading away lower-value resources you have in quantity (Wheat, Wood, Sheep).\n4.  **Evaluate Opponent's Offer:** The opponent is offering 4 Wheat (4 * 5 = 20 value) and 3 Wood (3 * 10 = 30 value), for a total offered value of 50. They are requesting 1 Ore (36 value) and 1 Brick (27 value), for a total requested value of 63.\n5.  **Identify Value Discrepancy:** The opponent's offer values their resources at 50 units and requests resources worth 63 units from you. This is a negative value trade for you (-13 value).\n6.  **Trading Strategy - Value Maximization:** You should only accept offers that increase your total resource value. You should make offers that give away lower value resources for higher value resources, or offers where the value of what you receive is greater than the value of what you give.\n7.  **Consider Relative Value (Opportunity Cost):** You have plenty of Wheat and Wood. They are cheap. Trading them for more valuable resources is good. Ore and Brick are valuable. Giving them up for less valuable items is bad, unless the quantity differential makes it worthwhile.\n8.  **Past Interactions:** You previously accepted an offer of 5 Sheep (70) + 4 Wood (40) = 110 value for 2 Brick (54) + 1 Ore (36) = 90 value.

      "response": "To tackle this task effectively, let's first understand the current situation and the goal.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- Resources and their quantities: Wheat (21), Wood (17), Sheep (18), Brick (15), Ore (10).\n- Values of resources: Wheat (6), Wood (8), Sheep (15), Brick (28), Ore (40).\n- Previous trades and outcomes:\n  1. Offered 5 Wheat, 3 Wood for 2 Brick, 1 Ore to Player 1. Rejected.\n  2. Offered 5 Sheep, 4 Wood for 2 Brick, 1 Ore to Player 1. Accepted.\n  3. Offered 4 Wheat, 3 Wood for 1 Ore, 1 Brick to Player 1. Rejected.\n  4. Received an offer from Player 1: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood for 1 Brick, 1 Ore.\n\n### Goal:\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources held.\n\n### Generate Knowledge:\n1. **Assess Current Resource Value**: Calculate the total value of current resources.\n   - Total Value = (21*6) + (17*8) + (18*15) + (15*28) + (10*40) = 126 + 136 + 270 + 420 + 400 = 1352.\n\n2. **Understand Trade-offs**: To increase the total value, we need to acquire resources that are of higher value relative to what we give away.\n\n3. **Analyze Previous Trades**:\n   - The first offer was rejected; it was asking for more valuable resources (2 Brick, 1 Ore) compared to what was being offered (5 Wheat, 3 Wood).\n   - The second offer was accepted, indicating that Player 1 valued 5 Sheep, 4 Wood more than 2 Brick, 1 Ore. This trade resulted in gaining 2 Brick (56) and 1 Ore (40) while losing 5 Sheep (75) and 4 Wood (32), totaling a loss of 107 - 96 = -11 in value. Let's verify: Before the trade, we had 18 Sheep and 17 Wood; after the trade, we have 13 Sheep and 13 Wood. So, we gave away (5*15) + (4*8) = 75 + 32 = 107 and got (2*28) + (40) = 56 + 40 = 96. The trade actually decreased our total value by 11.\n   - The third offer was rejected, similar to the first, indicating that the requested resources (1 Ore, 1 Brick) were likely valued more by us than what was offered (4 Wheat, 3 Wood).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Latest Offer from Player 1**:\n   - Player 1 is offering 8 Wheat (8*6 = 48) and 3 Wood (3*8 = 24) for 1 Brick (28) and 1 Ore (40). The total value offered is 48 + 24 = 72, and the total value requested is 28 + 40 = 68.\n   - Accepting this offer would mean gaining 72 worth of resources and losing 68 worth, resulting in a net gain of 72 - 68 = 4.\n\n5. **Strategy**:\n   - Since the latest offer from Player 1 results in a net gain, it is beneficial to accept it.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the analysis, the best course of action is to accept the latest offer from Player 1 as it results in a net gain in the total value of resources.\n\n### Action:\n`[Accept]`\n\nThis action accepts the offer made by Player 1: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood for 1 Brick, 1 Ore, which is expected to increase our total resource value.",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I should always aim to trade away resources with lower value per unit for resources with higher value per unit, or to acquire a net increase in total value even if the individual unit values are complex.\n2.  **Resource Scarcity/Demand:** While I don't know Player 0's resources, I can infer demand based on their offers. They've consistently asked for Brick and Ore, which are my highest-value resources. This indicates these resources are valuable to them, and I should leverage this.\n3.  **My Resource Composition:**\n    *   Wheat (Value: 5): Low value, high quantity. Good for trading away.\n    *   Wood (Value: 10): Medium-low value, low quantity. Can be traded, but I don't have much.\n    *   Sheep (Value: 14): Medium value, decent quantity. Good for trading.\n    *   Brick (Value: 27): High value, medium quantity. Valuable to hold onto, trade only for significant gains.\n    *   Ore (Value: 36): Highest value, decent quantity. Most valuable to hold onto, trade only for significant gains.\n4.  **Offer Analysis (Player 0's past behavior):**\n    *   P0 has repeatedly requested Brick and Ore. This confirms their high value and P0's likely need.\n    *   P0 has offered Wheat, Wood, and Sheep. These are generally lower-value resources for me.\n    *   Player 0 accepted my last offer: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore. Let's calculate the value for me:\n        *   Resources out: (8 x 5) + (3 x 10) = 40 + 30 = 70\n        *   Resources in: (1 x 27) + (1 x 36) = 27 + 36 = 63\n        *   Net change: 63 - 70 = -7. This was a *loss* for me in value. **This is a critical mistake observation.** I accepted a negative value trade. My previous logic for the accepted trade was flawed. I need to be more careful.\n5.  **Re-evaluating Trade Strategy:** I should *not* trade away my high-value resources (Brick, Ore) unless the incoming resources offer a significantly *higher* total value. Trading Wheat, Wood, Sheep for Brick or Ore is ideal. Trading Brick/Ore for more Wheat/Wood/Sheep is generally bad unless the quantity exchanged makes it overwhelmingly positive (e.g., 1 Ore for 200 Wheat, which is unlikely).\n6.  **Negotiation Leverage:** Player 0's repeated requests for Brick and Ore give me leverage. I should try to get favorable rates for them.\n7.  **Turn Limit:** 10 turns. We are well into the game. I need to make productive trades now to maximize value.\n\nGiven Player 0's consistent demand for Brick and Ore, I should continue trying to acquire them while giving up my lower-value resources. I must be precise with value calculations to ensure I gain net value. My last trade was a net value loss because I gave up 70 value for 63 value. I was too focused on getting high-value items without checking the total.\n\nMy current inventory value:\nWheat: 16 * 5 = 80\nWood: 5 * 10 = 50\nSheep: 13 * 14 = 182\nBrick: 7 * 27 = 189\nOre: 12 * 36 = 432\nTotal: 80 + 50 + 182 + 189 + 432 = 933\n\nPrevious trade for me: 8 Wheat (40) + 3 Wood (30) -> 1 Brick (27) + 1 Ore (36). Out: 70. In: 63. Net: -7. This was a bad trade for me.\n\nThe last offer from Player 0 was 4 Wheat (20), 3 Wood (30) -> 1 Ore (36), 1 Brick (27).\nValue out (P0): 50. Value in (P0): 63.\nValue out (Me): 63. Value in (Me): 50.\nThis was a bad trade for me, so rejecting it was correct.\n\nI need to make an offer where the value of what I receive is significantly higher than what I give up. Given P0's desire for Brick and Ore, perhaps I can offer a combination of my plentiful low-value resources (Wheat, Sheep) for their high-value ones.\n\nLet's aim for a trade where I give up low-value items and receive high-value items, focusing on a clear positive value change for myself.\n\nPlayer 0 wants Brick and Ore.\nI want Brick and Ore.\n\nPerhaps I can offer a significant amount of Wheat and Sheep for just one Brick or one Ore, since those are my highest value items and P0 seems to be having trouble obtaining them from me.\n\nConsider an offer: 10 Wheat (50) + 5 Sheep (70) = 120\nFor: 1 Brick (27) + 1 Ore (36) = 63.\nThis is still a net loss for me (-57). My problem is that I have low-value items, and Player 0 wants my high-value items.\n\nI must focus on value. I *cannot* trade Brick and Ore away easily unless it's for *more* Brick/Ore or extremely high quantities of other resources that somehow make up the difference.\n\nLet's look at my last successful trade, from P0's perspective. P0 gave me 5 Sheep (70), 4 Wood (40) -> 2 Brick (54), 1 Ore (36).\nP0 Value Out: 110. P0 Value In: 90. Net: -20 for P0. They accepted a bad deal.\nThis means P0 is willing to take a loss if they need the resources. I should try to exploit that, but *not* by giving up my high-value resources.\n\nMy resources are:\n[Wheat] Qty: 16 Value: 5\n[Wood] Qty: 5 Value: 10\n[Sheep] Qty: 13 Value: 14\n[Brick] Qty: 7 Value: 27\n[Ore] Qty: 12 Value: 36\n\nI want to acquire more Brick and Ore. I need to offer something P0 finds valuable enough for these.\nWhat if I offer a lot of my low-value resources for a small amount of P0's low-value resources, but only if they are somehow more valuable to me? No, that's not the goal.\n\nThe goal is to increase *my* total value.\nMy current strategy should be:\n1. Do not trade away Brick or Ore unless the net value gain is substantial (e.g., 1 Ore for 2 Brick + something else valuable).\n2. Offer my abundant lower-value resources (Wheat, Sheep) for higher-value ones (Brick, Ore).\n\nLet's craft an offer that tries to improve my value.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Sheep.\nWhat about: 15 Wheat (75) -> 1 Brick (27) or 1 Ore (36)? P0 would probably reject this as the value is terrible for them.\nP0 desperately wants Brick and Ore.\nWhat if I trade 1 Brick for something much more valuable?\nExample: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 2 Ore]. My value out: 27. My value in: 72. Net: +45. This is highly unlikely for P0 to accept.\n\nI need to find a balance. I gave up 8 Wheat (40) and 3 Wood (30) for 1 Brick (27) and 1 Ore (36). Net -7. I should NOT repeat this.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick/Ore without giving up any Brick/Ore.\nOffer: Many Wheat, Some Sheep -> 1 Brick.\nConsider: 10 Wheat (50) + 5 Sheep (70) = 120. P0 is asking for Brick and Ore. This is bad for me. I should be asking for Brick and Ore.\n\nWhat about:\n[Offer: 15 Wheat, 8 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore]\nMy materials out:\n15 Wheat * 5 = 75\n8 Sheep * 14 = 112\nTotal out: 187\n\nMy desired materials in:\n1 Brick * 27 = 27\n1 Ore * 36 = 36\nTotal in: 63\n\nThis is a terrible trade for me (-124). I gave up too much low value stuff for too little high value stuff. This won't work.\nThe issue is that P0 is asking for my high value stuff. My strategy should be to reject offers where I give up high-value resources at a loss and make offers where I gain high-value resources at their expense.\n\nCurrent turn is 6.\nPlayer 0 offered 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick, rejected by Player 1 (me).\nValue of P0 offer to me: (4*5 + 3*10) = 50 (their side) vs (1*36 + 1*27) = 63 (my side of giving). This was a bad trade for me.\n\nMy offer was 8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore (accepted by P0).\nValue to me: give 8W=40, 3Wd=30. Total 70. Get 1B=27, 1O=36. Total 63. Net value for me: -7. This was a mistake.\n\nI need to make an offer that's good for *me*.\nSince P0 accepted a losing offer from me last time, they may be desperate. I should use this to my advantage.\n\nI want to increase my Brick and Ore. What can I offer for 1 Brick (27 value)?\nMaybe 3 Wood (30) + 1 Sheep (14) = 44 total value for 1 Brick (27). Still bad for me.\nThe relative values make it hard to trade my lower value resources for P0's higher value ones because my low values are *so* low, and my high values are relatively good.\n\nLet's aim for a modest gain.\nMy current strategy should be to give up *only* Wheat and Sheep, and ideally acquire Brick or Ore.\n\nHow about:\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 5 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nMy value out: (10 * 5) + (5 * 14) = 50 + 70 = 120\nMy desired value in: (1 * 27) = 27\nThis is a -93 loss for me. Player 0 would likely accept this given their past behavior, but it's terrible for me.\n\nI need to reverse the net value flow.\nP0 *accepted* my prior offer which was bad for me. This indicates they are desperate for Brick and Ore.\nSo I should offer a trade that is good for *me* and bad for *them*, leveraging their desperation.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep (14) for 1 Brick (27)? Probably too good for me and bad for them. They'd likely reject.\n\nLet's aim to get at least 1 Brick or 1 Ore for Wheat/Sheep.\nP0 accepted a deal where they gave me 5 Sheep (70) + 4 Wood (40) = 110 for 2 Brick (54) + 1 Ore (36) = 90.\nP0 lost 20. But they got 2B and 1O. This implies their desire for B and O is very high.\n\nI will offer a trade that significantly increases my value, even if it seems \"unfair\" to Player 0 based on unit counts, but fair based on *my* value maximization.\n\nI don't have much Wood. Wheat and Sheep are my best candidates to offer.\nOffer: 15 Wheat, 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore\nMy value out: 15 * 5 (Wheat) + 5 * 14 (Sheep) = 75 + 70 = 145\nMy value in: 1 * 36 (Ore) = 36\nNet loss for me: -109. This is still horrible.\n\nI must avoid offering *any* of my high-value items (Brick, Ore) unless I get even higher value in return.\nI also must avoid trades where I give up low-value items for high-value items, but the total value of the \"low\" items given is still far greater than the total value of the \"high\" items received.\n\nLet's re-evaluate player 0's request:\nPlayer 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore, 1 Brick\nValue of P0 offer if I accepted: I would give 1 Ore (36), 1 Brick (27) = 63. I would receive 4 Wheat (20), 3 Wood (30) = 50. Net -13. This was correctly rejected.\n\nMy goal is to increase my value.\nI have a significant amount of Wheat (16) and Sheep (13).\nI want more Brick and Ore.\n\nWhat if I counter P0's last offer, but requesting more beneficial terms for me?\nP0 requested 1 Ore, 1 Brick for 4 Wheat, 3 Wood.\nI could offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 0 Ore, 0 Brick. (Not a trade).\n\nI just accepted a -7 value trade on my last turn. I need to make a positive value trade.\n\nLet's try to get just 1 Brick. It's 27 value.\nWhat can I give up for 27 value or less?\n2 Sheep (28) -> 1 Brick (27) - close to even. (Net -1 to me)\n1 Sheep (14) + 2 Wheat (10) = 24 -> 1 Brick (27) - good for me (+3). Let's try this. This is a very small gain.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nMy value out = 2 * 5 (Wheat) + 1 * 14 (Sheep) = 10 + 14 = 24\nMy value in = 1 * 27 (Brick) = 27\nNet value gain for me = 27 - 24 = +3. This is a small gain, but it's a gain, and it leverages Player 0's potential desire for Sheep or Wheat while getting me a valuable Brick. It's a risk P0 might not accept if they think it's too much for them for 1 Brick. But P0 has accepted worse deals.\n\nLet's confirm my resources before making the offer.\nWheat: 16\nWood: 5\nSheep: 13\nBrick: 7\nOre: 12\n\nIf this trade is accepted:\nWheat: 16 - 2 = 14\nSheep: 13 - 1 = 12\nBrick: 7 + 1 = 8\n\nTotal value check after trade:\nWheat: 14 * 5 = 70\nWood: 5 * 10 = 50\nSheep: 12 * 14 = 168\nBrick: 8 * 27 = 216\nOre: 12 * 36 = 432\nNew total: 70 + 50 + 168 + 216 + 432 = 936\nPrevious total: 933.\nGain: +3.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade I make should result in a net gain in value. I need to calculate the value of both what I offer and what I request.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** Each resource has a specific value. I should prioritize trading away lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n    *   Wheat: 5\n    *   Wood: 10\n    *   Sheep: 14\n    *   Brick: 27\n    *   Ore: 36\n3.  **Scarcity and Demand (Implied):** While I don't know Player 0's holdings, their previous offers give some clues. They've consistently asked for Brick and Ore. This suggests they value these highly or need them for their own objectives. My Ore and Brick are my highest value resources. I need to be careful when trading them.\n4.  **Strategic Offering:**\n    *   **Overvaluing My Request:** I should ask for more value than I offer, within reason.\n    *   **Undervalue My Offer (from my perspective):** If I'm offering low-value items, I can offer more quantity to make the deal appealing, while still requesting high-value items.\n    *   **Responding to Player 0's Needs:** Player 0 seems to want Brick and Ore. I can leverage this by offering them these resources if the deal is extremely favorable to me, or by asking for a high price for them.\n5.  **Understanding Past Trades:**\n    *   My accepted trade: 5 Sheep (70) + 4 Wood (40) -> 2 Brick (54) + 1 Ore (36). I gave away 110 value for 90 value. This was a *loss* for me. This highlights the importance of precise value calculation. I must avoid such mistakes.\n    *   My accepted trade: 8 Wheat (40) + 3 Wood (30) -> 1 Brick (27) + 1 Ore (36). I gave away 70 value for 63 value. Another *loss*. I need to be much more vigilant!\n6.  **Patience and Persistence:** I have 10 turns. I don't need to make a bad deal immediately. I can deny unfavorable offers and continue to propose my own.\n7.  **Current Resources and Targets:** I have adequate quantities of Wheat, Sheep, Ore, and Brick. My Wood quantity is low. I should aim to increase my high-value resources (Brick, Ore) or convert low-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) into them.\n\nBased on previous turns, I have made net calculated value losses. I need to reverse this trend. My previous offer of \"1 Brick -> 2 Ore\" was a good *value* proposition for me (27 -> 72), even though it was denied. I should lean into such high-margin requests.\n\nCurrent Resources:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 16 Value: 80\n*   [Wood] Qty: 5 Value: 50\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 13 Value: 182\n*   [Brick] Qty: 7 Value: 189\n*   [Ore] Qty: 12 Value: 432\nTotal Value: 933\n\nMy goal is to increase this total value. I have plenty of Wheat and Sheep, which are lower value. I also have plenty of Ore and Brick, but these are high value, so I want to acquire more or trade them for even *more* value.\n\nPlayer 0 has consistently asked for Brick and Ore. This is my leverage. I should offer some quantities of my lower-value resources (Wheat, Sheep, Wood) to acquire more high-value resources (Brick, Ore).\n\nLet's construct an offer:\nOffer: 5 Wheat (25) + 3 Sheep (42) = 67 value\nRequest: 1 Brick (27) + 1 Ore (36) = 63 value\nThis is still a slight *loss* for me. I need to make sure the value of requested items is higher.\n\nLet's try:\nOffer: 8 Wheat (40) + 4 Sheep (56) = 96 value\nRequest: 2 Brick (54) + 1 Ore (36) = 90 value\nStill a loss. This is why I've been losing value.\n\nI must reverse the value of what I offer vs what I request.\n\nPreferred trades:\n1.  Trade low-value for high-value (e.g., Wheat/Wood/Sheep for Brick/Ore).\n2.  Trade mid-value for high-value (e.g., Sheep for Brick/Ore, where value gain exists).\n3.  Trade high-value for *even higher* value (e.g., Brick for multiple Ore, or Ore for multiple Brick/Ore).\n\nPlayer 0 has been asking for Brick and Ore. I have rejected their offers that provided low value for my high-value items. My successful trade for Player 0 was \"8 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick, 1 Ore\". This was 70 value offered for 63 received - a loss for me. I need to stop repeating this.\n\nI will try to get more Ore, as it's the highest value. I have plenty of Wheat and Sheep.\nMy current offer of \"1 Brick -> 2 Ore\" was a 27 value offer for 72 value requested, which is a great gain for me. No wonder it was denied. I need to find a more balanced, but still beneficial, offer.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nOption 1: Offer Wheat/Sheep for Ore\n   Offer: 10 Wheat (50) + 5 Sheep (70) = 120 Value\n   Request: 3 Ore (108)\n   This is a loss for me.\n\nMy focus should be on *net positive value*. The best way to make a net positive value trade is to offer many low-value items for a few high-value ones.\n\nLooking at my high quantity, low value resources:\n*   Wheat: 16 (value 5)\n*   Sheep: 13 (value 14)\n\nLet's try to get Brick or Ore.\n\nOffer: 6 Sheep (84) + 5 Wheat (25) = 109 value\nRequest: 3 Brick (81) + 1 Ore (36) = 117 value. This is a slight gain for me. A gain of 8 value. This is a reasonable offer.\n\n[Offer: 6 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generating Knowledge\n\nTo make effective trading decisions, we need to understand the current state of our resources and the principles guiding profitable trades.\n\n1. **Current Resource Valuation**:\n   - Calculate the total value of the resources we currently hold.\n     - Wheat: 21 units * 6 = 126\n     - Wood: 17 units * 8 = 136\n     - Sheep: 18 units * 15 = 270\n     - Brick: 15 units * 28 = 420\n     - Ore: 10 units * 40 = 400\n     - Total Value = 126 + 136 + 270 + 420 + 400 = 1352\n\n2. **Trade History and Outcomes**:\n   - We initially offered 5 Wheat and 3 Wood for 2 Brick and 1 Ore. Player 1 rejected it.\n   - Then, we offered 5 Sheep and 4 Wood for 2 Brick and 1 Ore. Player 1 accepted it.\n     - After this trade, our resources changed:\n       - Lost: 5 Sheep, 4 Wood\n       - Gained: 2 Brick, 1 Ore\n       - New Quantities: Sheep = 18 - 5 = 13, Wood = 17 - 4 = 13, Brick = 15 + 2 = 17, Ore = 10 + 1 = 11\n       - New Valuation: Sheep = 13 * 15 = 195, Wood = 13 * 8 = 104, Brick = 17 * 28 = 476, Ore = 11 * 40 = 440\n       - Total Value after trade = 195 + 104 + 476 + 440 + (Wheat = 21 * 6 = 126) = 1341\n   - We then offered 4 Wheat and 3 Wood for 1 Ore and 1 Brick. Player 1 rejected it.\n   - Player 1 offered 8 Wheat and 3 Wood for 1 Brick and 1 Ore. We accepted it.\n     - After this trade, our resources changed:\n       - Gained: 8 Wheat, 3 Wood\n       - Lost: 1 Brick, 1 Ore\n       - New Quantities: Wheat = 21 + 8 = 29, Wood = 13 + 3 = 16, Brick = 17 - 1 = 16, Ore = 11 - 1 = 10\n       - New Valuation: Wheat = 29 * 6 = 174, Wood = 16 * 8 = 128, Brick = 16 * 28 = 448, Ore = 10 * 40 = 400\n       - Total Value after trade = 174 + 128 + (Sheep = 195) + 448 + 400 = 1345\n   - Player 1 offered 1 Brick for 2 Ore. We rejected it.\n   - Recently, Player 1 offered 6 Sheep and 5 Wheat for 3 Brick and 1 Ore.\n\n3. **Key Principles and Strategies**:\n   - **Value Maximization**: Trades should aim at increasing the total value of our resources.\n   - **Resource Valuation**: Understand the value of each resource and negotiate accordingly.\n   - **Assessing Offers**: Evaluate both the resources being offered and the resources being requested in terms of their value.\n\n### Applying Generated Knowledge\n\n1. **Evaluating the Latest Offer**:\n   - Player 1's latest offer: 6 Sheep and 5 Wheat for 3 Brick and 1 Ore.\n     - Offered: 6 Sheep * 15 + 5 Wheat * 6 = 90 + 30 = 120\n     - Requested: 3 Brick * 28 + 1 Ore * 40 = 84 + 40 = 124\n     - The value of what we give (3 Brick, 1 Ore) is 124, and what we get (6 Sheep, 5 Wheat) is valued at 120. This trade is not beneficial as it results in a loss of 4 in total value.\n\n2. **Making a Trading Decision**:\n   - Since the latest offer from Player 1 results in a negative gain (loss of 4), we should reject it.\n   - Our action: `[Deny]`\n\n3. **Formulating a New Offer**:\n   - To increase our total resource value, we need to identify what we can offer that is less valuable to us but potentially more valuable to Player 1, and vice versa.\n   - Considering our current resources and their values, we should look for opportunities to gain higher-value resources.\n   - A potential offer could involve trading some of our Wheat or Wood (lower value resources) for Brick or Ore (higher value resources) if possible.\n\nLet's propose a new trade:\n- We have Wheat (Value: 6) and Wood (Value: 8) in relatively higher quantities compared to other resources. Let's offer some of these for higher-value resources.\n- Offering 4 Wood and 6 Wheat for 2 Ore could be a potential trade. \n  - Offered: 4 Wood * 8 + 6 Wheat * 6 = 32 + 36 = 68\n  - Requested: 2 Ore * 40 = 80\n  - This trade increases our total value by 12.\n\nThus, a new offer could be: `[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Ore]`\n\n### Trading Decision\n\n`[Offer: 6 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Ore]`",
