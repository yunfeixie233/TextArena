      "response": "Generate Knowledge: What key principles, strategies, or insights about resource trading and negotiation are most relevant to your current situation?\n\n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: My current resource values per unit are:\n   - Wheat: 5\n   - Wood: 12\n   - Sheep: 12\n   - Brick: 25\n   - Ore: 33\n   This means Ore is the most valuable resource I have, followed by Brick, then Wood and Sheep (equal), and Wheat is least valuable. I should avoid giving up Ore unless receiving higher value in return.\n\n2. **Abundance and Opportunity Cost**: \n   - I have 25 Brick \u2014 a large quantity \u2014 and Brick is highly valuable (25). While valuable, surplus Brick could be leveraged in trades if I receive higher relative value.\n   - I have only 6 Ore \u2014 a limited supply \u2014 and each unit is worth 33. I should guard Ore carefully.\n   - Sheep (8) and Wood (13) are moderately stocked. Since their unit values are equal (12), I can potentially trade these if it increases overall value.\n   - Wheat (17) has low value per unit (5). It is abundant but not very valuable. I should be willing to trade Wheat for higher-value resources, even in bulk.\n\n3. **Trading Leverage**: Players typically seek Ore and Brick because of high point values. I possess both, which gives me strong negotiation power. However, I must avoid exploitative offers where I give high-value or scarce resources for lower-value returns.\n\n4. **Trading Ratios & Fair Value Exchange**: A rational trade should provide net positive value. For example:\n   - Giving 1 Ore (33) should return resources worth more than 33.\n   - Giving 1 Brick (25) should return >=26 value.\n   - Giving 1 Sheep (12) or Wood (12): aim for 12+ in return.\n   - Giving Wheat (5): I can afford to trade at a better exchange ratio since it\u2019s low value.\n\n5. **Strategic Goal**: Increase total value of my holdings. This can be achieved by:\n   - Acquiring higher-value resources (especially Ore or Brick).\n   - Reducing low-value holdings (Wheat) in exchange for high-value ones.\n   - Avoiding trades that deplete high-value, low-quantity resources (like Ore) without significant gain.\n\n6. **Anticipating Offers**: Other players may want Ore or Brick. I can use Wheat, Sheep, or Wood as bargaining tools to request Ore or other underrepresented high-value items.\n\n7. **No Trade = Default**: If no beneficial offer is made, [Deny] keeps my assets intact \u2014 which is better than a losing trade.\n\nApply Knowledge: Since no incoming offer has been made yet, I must initiate to create value.\n\nBest Strategy: Use surplus Wheat (low value) and moderate Sheep/Wood to request higher-value Brick or Ore. Alternatively, trade excess Brick (if abundant) for Ore, but only if net value increases.\n\nI will make an offer that offloads low-value Wheat and moderate Sheep to acquire high-value Ore.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: What key principles, strategies, or insights about resource trading and negotiation are most relevant to your current situation?\n\n- **Value Asymmetry Creates Trading Opportunities**: Since players likely value resources differently based on their current needs (e.g., Player 1 may prioritize Wheat for immediate development despite its low objective value), structuring offers around *your* surplus (Wheat) and *desired* high-value resources (Ore) can yield mutually beneficial trades even if objective values appear unequal.  \n- **Minimize Loss Aversion for Other Players**: Player 1 rejected a prior offer (5 Wheat, 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore) because the objective value deficit (66 requested vs. 61 offered) made it unattractive. Smaller, incremental trades (e.g., requesting 1 Ore instead of 2) reduce perceived risk and increase acceptance likelihood.  \n- **Focus on High-Impact, Low-Cost Assets**: Wheat (value: 5) is your largest surplus (17 units). Trading even 5 Wheat (25 value) for 1 Ore (33 value) creates an immediate +8 value gain with minimal impact on your strategic flexibility.  \n- **Avoid Bundling Undesired Resources**: The initial offer included Sheep, which Player 1 may lack interest in. Simplifying to a single-resource trade (Wheat \u2192 Ore) removes friction and aligns with targeted negotiation.  \n- **Incremental Gains Compound**: Small, frequent trades (e.g., +8 value per Ore) are more sustainable than high-risk offers and align with the 10-turn limit, allowing steady value accumulation without exhausting leverage.  \n\n**Trading Decision**:  \nPlayer 1 rejected a bundled offer featuring Wheat and Sheep for Ore. Given their aversion to Sheep-inclusive deals and the need to prioritize unidirectional surplus (Wheat), the optimal play is a simple, high-value-density trade: **5 Wheat (25 value) \u2192 1 Ore (33 value)**. This maximizes value gain (+8) while minimizing resource commitment, leveraging your Wheat abundance and Ore scarcity to incentivize Player 1\u2019s acceptance.  \n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

Value Maximization & Efficiency  \n   - A trade is +EV only when the value I gain outweighs the value I give.  \n   - You should use \u201cvalue per unit\u201d to evaluate the trade instantly: Ore = 39, Wheat = 5, Sheep = 12, Brick = 30, Wood = 12.  \n   - Never over-pay for low-value bulk (and never give away high-value units for underpriced goods).\n\n2.

Practical Offer Construction  \n   - Bundle your low-value surplus first (Wheat/Sheep/Wood) in exchange for Brick.  \n   - Keep round numbers (e.g., 3 Ore = 117 value) to make counters easier to calculate.  \n   - Always ensure total volume I give is less than what I receive in value terms.\n\nApplying Knowledge:\n\nEnemy offers:  \n1. 5 Wheat (25), 3 Sheep (36) \u2192 2 Ore (78)\u2003value lost 25+36=61, value gained =78 \u2192 net +17 to me; earlier I rejected, but it was actually favourable.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: \n\n1. **Resource Scarcity and Value Hierarchy**: Ore has the highest individual value (33), followed by Brick (25), then Wood and Sheep (12), and Wheat (5). Since Ore is valuable and scarce (you only have 6), acquiring more could significantly increase your total resource value. Conversely, Brick, while high in value, is abundant in your inventory (25), so trading excess Brick may be strategic if it yields higher-value or rarer resources.\n\n2. **Diminishing Returns and Surplus Utilization**: You have an unusually high quantity of Brick (25) and Wheat (17), which suggests potential for leveraging surplus in trades. Wheat has the lowest value per unit, so offering it in bulk can be low-cost for high-return trades.\n\n3. **Trade Efficiency and Exchange Rate**: To increase total value, each trade should ideally yield a net gain in total value or acquire a higher-value resource (especially Ore) at a favorable rate. Offering surplus resources (Wheat, Brick) in exchange for scarce, high-value ones (Ore, possibly Sheep or Wood if undervalued) is key.\n\n4. **Counterparty Incentives**: Player 1 is offering 3 Ore and 2 Sheep in exchange for 5 Brick and 2 Sheep \u2014 effectively, they want 5 Brick for 3 Ore (since 2 Sheep cancel out). This is a poor deal for you: Ore is worth more (33) than Brick (25), so 3 Ore = 99 value vs 5 Brick = 125, but you lose 5 Brick (125) to gain 3 Ore (99) \u2014 a net value loss of 26. Additionally, you're giving up 2 Sheep which you have only 8 of. This offer is disadvantageous and should be denied.\n\n5. **Negotiation Positioning**: After two of your offers (involving Wheat and Sheep for Ore) were rejected, Player 1 may be signaling a preference for Brick. Since you have surplus Brick, consider crafting an offer that gives Brick in exchange for Ore, but at a rate favorable to you \u2014 not giving more value than you receive.\n\n6. **Strategic Offer Design**: Use your surplus Brick as leverage. Propose a deal where you trade a moderate amount of Brick for Ore, possibly adding a small amount of low-value resource to entice acceptance without significant cost.\n\n7. **Patient Iteration**: Multiple rounds allow for offer calibration. Rejections help gauge opponent preferences.

Ore, however, remains scarce and highly valuable.\n\n- Price anchoring and concession ladders  \n  Player 0 has steadily lowered the \u201cprice\u201d for Ore: 5 Wheat+3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore (rejected) \u2192 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore (rejected) \u2192 4 Brick \u2192 1 Ore.  \n  The current ask of 4 Brick \u2248 120 VP for 1 Ore \u2248 39 VP is 3:1 from his perspective but only 1:3 from mine. It is therefore still a net loss (-81 VP) for me to accept.\n\n- Opportunity cost of idle Wheat  \n  28 units of 5-point Wheat are sitting idle; converting even a fraction of that low-value Wheat into high-value Brick/Ore is high-priority.\n\nTrading decision\n\nI should counter-offer in a way that (i) increases my total value, and (ii) leverages my surplus low-value Wheat.\n\nI value 1 Ore at 39.  \nThe lowest acceptable Ore price I should pay is therefore any bundle whose summed value is \u2264 39.\n\nI have 22 Wheat @5 \u2192 110 VP total.  \nTrading away 7 Wheat (35 VP) for 1 Ore (39 VP) yields a net +4 VP, still modest.  \nTrading 7 Wheat and 1 Sheep (12 VP) totals 47 VP \u2192 slightly negative.  \nBut if I instead offer only Wheat (which costs me the least) and target Brick (30 VP/unit) instead of Ore, I gain more.\n\nA balanced proposal:  \n7 Wheat (35 VP) \u2192 1 Brick (30 VP) is a net \u20115 VP, unacceptable.  \nHowever, 8 Wheat (40 VP) \u2192 1 Brick (30 VP) is worse.  \nI need a two-way exchange so that the bundle values match.\n\nA workable two-way trade:\n\nGive: 8 Wheat (8 \u00d7 5 = 40 VP)  \nGet: 1 Brick (30 VP) + 1 Sheep (12 VP) = 42 VP  \nNet gain = +2 VP for me.\n\nThat is small; but since Brick is abundant for Player 0 (he offered 4 Brick easily), I can push the bundle upward slightly.\n\nRevised proposal\n\nGive: 9 Wheat + 1 Sheep (total = 9\u00d75 + 12 = 57 VP)  \nGet: 2 Brick (60 VP) + 1 Wheat returned (so he only nets 1 Wheat and keeps Sheep count even)\n\nActually simpler and cleaner:\n\nGive: 10 Wheat @5 (50 VP) \u2192 Get: 1 Brick (30 VP) + 1 Ore (39 VP) = 69 VP  \nNet gain = +19 VP and uses only my lowest-value resource.\n\nThat is very favorable for me and still looks attractive to Player 0 because it yields 10 food units (Wheat) at the cost of only 1 Brick and 1 Ore.\n\nFinal offer\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]\n\n(2 Ore is what I want; 10 Wheat is still only 50 VP for 78 VP of Ore, a large gain of +28 VP for me.  \nThis is aggressive, but keeps Ore as the centerpiece while using only my cheap resource.)\n\nAction token\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "[Knowledge Generation]\n\n1. **Resource Value and Scarcity**:\n   - High-value resources (e.g., Ore at 33) are typically more valuable not just in point terms but often rarer in gameplay, making them strong trade leverage.\n   - Brick has a high value (25), but you have a large stockpile (25 units), making it potentially surplus.\n   - Wheat and Wood are numerous but lower in individual value, so leveraging surplus Wheat for higher-value resources like Ore is strategic.\n   - Sheep (value 12) and Wood (value 12) are mid-tier; you have moderate Sheep (8), so trading sparingly is wise.\n\n2. **Trade Efficiency**:\n   - Successful trades should increase your total portfolio value. Evaluate offers based on net value gain.\n   - Offers should aim to gain high-value resources (Ore) in exchange for lower-value or surplus resources (Wheat, some Brick).\n\n3. **Counterparty Incentives**:\n   - Player 1 may value Brick or Wheat if they are building or completing projects.\n   - Their offer of 10 Wheat for 2 Ore suggests they value Wheat (perhaps for development) and are willing to trade Ore, which you highly value.\n   - But you should not accept trades that decrease your net value or give away high-value resources without sufficient return.\n\n4. **Trade Ratios and Fairness**:\n   - Fair trades encourage acceptance. For example:\n     - 1 Ore (33) \u2248 2\u20133 Wheat (5) = 10\u201315 \u2192 poor direct exchange unless bundled.\n     - Better: Offer Brick (25) for 1 Ore (33) is favorable for you, net +8 value.\n   - However, perceived fairness matters: offering 1 Brick for 1 Ore might be seen as fair; 4 Brick for 1 Ore is exploitative.\n\n5. **Negotiation Persistence**:\n   - After repeated rejections, refine offers to be more attractive without sacrificing value.\n   - Use surplus: You have 17 Wheat \u2014 can use as trade bait.\n   - Brick surplus (25) allows selective trading, but don\u2019t deplete without gain.\n\n6. **Current Offers**:\n   - Player 1\u2019s latest: 10 Wheat \u2192 2 Ore.\n     - Value: You gain 2 Ore (66 value), give nothing. Free 66? Wait \u2014 no: Request is 2 Ore from you? Let\u2019s parse:\n     - \"[Offered items: 10 Wheat -> Requested items: 2 Ore]\" \u2014 means Player 1 offers 10 Wheat, wants 2 Ore from you.\n     - So you would give 2 Ore (66 value) for 10 Wheat (50 value) \u2192 net loss of 16 value. **Unfavorable.**\n\n[Decision Application]\n\nPlayer 1\u2019s offer: 10 Wheat \u2192 2 Ore (i.e., you give 2 Ore, get 10 Wheat)\n- Your cost: 2 Ore \u00d7 33 = 66 value\n- Your gain: 10 Wheat \u00d7 5 = 50 value\n- Net: -16 value \u2192 **bad deal**\n\nYou have been trying to *acquire* Ore, not sell it. All your previous offers were to get Ore by giving Wheat or Brick.\n\nTherefore, **reject**.\n\nBut you need to make a new offer to improve your position.\n\nStrategic offer idea:\n- Use surplus Brick (you have 25) to acquire Ore.\n- Offer: 3 Brick \u2192 1 Ore\n  - Cost: 3\u00d725 = 75\n  - Gain: 1\u00d733 = 33 \u2192 net -42? No, too expensive.\n- Better: Aim for smaller ratio.\n  - You can't trade 5 Brick for 1 Ore (125 vs 33) \u2014 insane.\n\nWait \u2014 reverse perspective: Others may want Brick. You can trade 2\u20133 Brick for 1 Ore if they\u2019re desperate.\n\nBut 1 Ore (33) should be worth more than Brick (25), so 1 Ore \u2248 1.3 Brick. So trading 1 Brick for 1 Ore is great for you.\n\nBut no one will accept that.\n\nMore realistic: Offer 2 Brick + something for 1 Ore.\n\nBut let\u2019s analyze prior attempts:\n- You offered 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore: was rejected. Too low (25 value for 33).\n- You offered 4 Brick \u2192 1 Ore: 100 value for 33? That\u2019s generous to them. Was rejected? Odd \u2014 unless they value Brick highly or are strategic.\n\nPossibility: Player 1 might want Sheep or Wheat.\n\nAlternative: Bundle low-value surplus into attractive package.\n\nTry: Offer 5 Wheat + 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore\n- Your cost: 5\u00d75 + 1\u00d712 = 25 + 12 = 37\n- Gain: 33\n- Close to even, slightly below \u2014 but may be acceptable if they need Wheat.\n\nBut previous 5 Wheat only for 1 Ore was rejected \u2014 likely need more.\n\nOr use Brick more wisely.\n\nYou have 25 Brick \u2014 more than enough. Can offer 2 Brick + 3 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore\n- Cost: 50 + 15 = 65\n- Gain: 33 \u2192 still not favorable for them? No \u2014 wait, from their view, they gain 65, lose 33 \u2192 good for them.\n\nBut they rejected 4 Brick \u2192 1 Ore. Why?\n\nPossibility: They have no Ore to trade. Or they are waiting for better offer.\n\nGiven that Player 1 offered 3 Ore, 2 Sheep \u2192 5 Brick, 2 Sheep, they clearly have Ore.\n\nBut their bid for 2 Ore from you suggests they want your Ore, not that they lack Ore \u2014 contradiction?\n\nWait: Player 1\u2019s offer: \u201cOffered items: 3 Ore, 2 Sheep -> Requested items: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\u201d\nThat means they give 3 Ore, 2 Sheep to get 5 Brick and 2 Sheep.\n\nSo they\u2019re offering 3 Ore and 2 Sheep, want 5 Brick and 2 Sheep.\n\nSo they have Ore \u2014 they are willing to give 3 Ore.\n\nBut then they made a new offer: \u201c10 Wheat -> 2 Ore\u201d \u2014 that would be them giving 10 Wheat, getting 2 Ore from you.\n\nBut that contradicts \u2014 first they offer 3 Ore, now they want 2 Ore?\n\nLikely: the system messaging is ambiguous.\n\nRe-read: \"Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 10 Wheat -> Requested items: 2 Ore\"\n\nSo Player 1 is **offering** 10 Wheat, **requesting** 2 Ore from you.\n\nSo they want 2 Ore, will give you 10 Wheat.\n\nThey are not consistent \u2014 previously they offered 3 Ore, now they want 2 Ore.\n\nPossibly a bluff or misstep.\n\nBut regardless: taking their Ore offer (3 Ore for trade) means you can get Ore from them.\n\nBut their current offer is not helpful.\n\nYou should restart targeting Ore acquisition via favorable bundle.\n\nBest move: make a new offer to trade surplus for Ore.\n\nTry: 5 Brick \u2192 1 Ore\n- Cost: 125, gain: 33 \u2014 too expensive.\n\nWait \u2014 values are per-unit, but total value? You must trade efficiently.\n\nActually, the goal is to increase total value of your resources.\n\nYou have:\n- Wheat: 17 \u00d7 5 = 85\n- Wood: 13 \u00d7 12 = 156\n- Sheep: 8 \u00d7 12 = 96\n- Brick: 25 \u00d7 25 = 625\n- Ore: 6 \u00d7 33 = 198\nTotal: 85+156=241; +96=337; +625=962; +198=1160\n\nOre is high value \u2014 acquiring more increases portfolio.\n\nBut to increase value, you need to trade low-value items for high-value ones.\n\nBrick is 25, Ore is 33 \u2014 so 1 Ore > 1 Brick.\n\nSo trading 1 Brick for 1 Ore is good (+8 value).\n\nBut who would give 1 Ore for 1 Brick?\n\nUnlikely.\n\nBest: offer 2 Brick + 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore\n- You give: 50 + 12 = 62\n- You get: 33 \u2192 loss? No: 33 is value to you, but they gain 50+12=62, lose 33 \u2014 good for them, bad for you.\n\nWait: the value is subjective or objective?\n\nIn most such games, the value is objective (fixed point value).\n\nSo Ore is worth 33 to everyone.\n\nThus, any trade where you receive Ore (33) in exchange for resources worth less than 33 is good.\n\nSo aim to spend <33 to get 33.\n\nOptions:\n- 5 Wheat = 25 < 33 \u2192 close, but not enough\n- 6 Wheat = 30 < 33 \u2192 good\n- 5 Wheat + 1 Sheep = 25+12=37 > 33 \u2192 too much\n- 2 Brick = 50 > 33 \u2192 too much\n- 1 Brick = 25 < 33 \u2192 good for trade, but who trades 1 Ore for 1 Brick?\n\nSo best: bundle low-value items just under 33.\n\nBut Player 1 may not accept.\n\nAlternatively, accept that trades may be near value-neutral.\n\nBut your goal is to *increase* total value.\n\nSo only accept or propose trades with net gain.\n\nYour previous offers:\n- 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore: 25 vs 33 \u2192 you gain 8 \u2192 good\n- Rejected. Maybe too low surplus.\n\nTry 6 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore: cost 30, gain 33 \u2192 +3\n\nOr 7 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore: cost 35 \u2192 net -2, bad.\n\nSo 6 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore is best.\n\nBut you have 17 Wheat \u2014 can afford.\n\nAlternatively, 3 Wheat + 1 Sheep = 15+12=27 \u2192 1 Ore: +6 \u2014 excellent.\n\nSo try: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore\n\nCost: 15+12=27, gain: 33 \u2192 +6\n\nBetter than 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore (25\u219233, +8) \u2014 similar.\n\nBut variety might help.\n\nBut let\u2019s see what Player 1 might want.\n\nThey offered to give 3 Ore, 2 Sheep for 5 Brick, 2 Sheep \u2014 so they want 5 Brick, give 3 Ore and 2 Sheep.\n\nThey are willing to give 3 Ore for 5 Brick \u2192 value: 99 for 125 \u2192 they lose 26? Odd.\n\nUnless they value Brick more.\n\nBut according to fixed values, 5 Brick = 125, 3 Ore = 99 \u2014 they are paying 125 for 99? No: they give 3 Ore (99), get 5 Brick (125) \u2014 gain 26 value.\n\nSo it\u2019s good for them.\n\nYou rejected \u2014 should you have accepted?\n\nYou would give 5 Brick (125), get 3 Ore (99) \u2014 lose 26 \u2014 yes, correct to deny.\n\nNow, they want 2 Ore from you for 10 Wheat \u2014 you\u2019d lose 16 \u2014 deny.\n\nSo current state: no active good offer.\n\nMake a new offer.\n\nBest: try to get 1 Ore for less than 33 value.\n\nPropose: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\n- Cost: 25 + 12 = 37 > 33 \u2192 net -4? Wait, no:\n  - You lose: 5 Wheat, 1 Sheep = 25 + 12 = 37 value\n  - You gain: 1 Ore = 33 value\n  - Net: -4 \u2192 bad\n\nWait, that\u2019s worse than giving 5 Wheat only (cost 25 \u2192 gain 33 \u2192 +8)\n\nSo 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore is better.\n\nWhy did Player 1 reject? Maybe they don\u2019t need Wheat.\n\nMaybe they want Brick.\n\nYou tried 4 Brick \u2192 1 Ore.\n\n4 Brick = 100 value \u2192 they gain 100, lose 33 \u2192 highly favorable for them, but rejected.\n\nWhy?\n\nPossibility: they don\u2019t have Ore to give? But they offered 3 Ore.\n\nUnless they changed plans.\n\nOr they are holding Ore.\n\nAlternative: they want Sheep.\n\nTheir counter-offer requested 2 Sheep \u2014 maybe they need Sheep.\n\nSo perhaps offer: 2 Brick + 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore\n- You: give 50+24=74, get 33 \u2192 huge loss \u2014 no.\n\nTo gain value, you must *receive* more than you give.\n\nSo only proposals where (value received) > (value given)\n\nSo to gain 1 Ore (33), give items summing to <33.\n\nOptions:\n- 5 Wheat = 25 \u2192 can do, gain +8\n- 6 Wheat = 30 \u2192 +3\n- 1 Wood = 12 \u2192 too low, won\u2019t be accepted\n- 15 Wheat = 75 for 2 Ore (66) \u2192 net +9? 66 - 75 = -9 \u2192 loss\n\nNo: 2 Ore = 66, 15 Wheat = 75 \u2192 if you give 15 Wheat, get 2 Ore \u2192 net -9\n\nBut if you get 2 Ore for 6 Wheat \u2192 66 vs 30 \u2192 +36 \u2192 huge gain.\n\nBut won\u2019t happen.\n\nSo best offer: minimize what you give, maximize what you get.\n\nSince 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore was rejected, try adding a small sweetener for them, but not cost you much.\n\nBut can't give less than 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore without overpaying.\n\nPerhaps bundle with something they want: they wanted Sheep in their offer.\n\nBut you only have 8.\n\nAlternatively, try to offer 1 Brick \u2192 1 Ore\n- Cost: 25, gain: 33 \u2192 net +8 \u2014 excellent\n\n1 Brick (25) for 1 Ore (33) \u2014 you gain 8.\n\nAnd for them, they gain 25, lose 33 \u2192 net -8 \u2014 they lose.\n\nBut they might accept if they need Brick badly.\n\nEarlier you offered 4 Brick \u2192 1 Ore, which is far worse for you \u2014 but rejected.\n\nOffering 1 Brick \u2192 1 Ore is better for you, but worse for them \u2014 less likely to accept.\n\nSo unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, use Wheat: offer 6 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore (30 cost, gain 33 \u2192 +3)\n\nOr 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore (+8)\n\nSince 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore was rejected, perhaps they want a higher quantity.\n\nTry: 10 Wheat \u2192 2 Ore\n- Give: 50, get: 66 \u2192 net +16\n\nBetter deal, more attractive.\n\nYou have 17 Wheat \u2014 after 10, still have 7.\n\nWorth trying.\n\n[Final Decision]\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: \n\n1. **Valuation Awareness**: Each resource has a fixed value: Wheat (5), Wood (12), Sheep (12), Brick (25), Ore (33). Trading should aim to increase the total value of my holdings. I should seek to acquire high-value resources (especially Ore at 33) and trade away low-value or excess resources.\n\n2. **Surplus and Scarcity**: I have a large surplus of Brick (25) and Wheat (17), both of which may be less critical for immediate value gains. However, Ore is my scarcest resource (only 6) and highest in value, suggesting high demand and potential for leverage. But since I have so little, I likely need more, not less.\n\n3. **Trade Efficiency**: Offers should minimize what I give per unit of value received. For example, giving 1 Wheat (value 5) for 1 Ore (value 33) would be highly favorable, but unlikely. Conversely, giving 1 Brick (25) for 1 Ore (33) gains only 8 value, which is acceptable if surplus Brick exists.\n\n4. **Perceived Fairness and Reciprocity**: Players may reject unbalanced offers. A successful trade must appear beneficial (or at least acceptable) to both parties. Offering something of moderate value (e.g., Wheat or Brick) for Ore may be more palatable if bundled intelligently.\n\n5. **Repeated Interaction and Signaling**: Multiple rejections suggest my offers may be too aggressive or poorly aligned with the other player\u2019s needs. Alternatives: Adjust offer generosity, diversify offered/requested resources, or wait for better opportunities.\n\n6. **Opportunity Cost of Inaction**: Failing to trade over multiple turns risks falling behind. With 10 turns total and several already passed, urgency increases.\n\n7. **Counter-Offer Analysis**: Player 1 previously offered 3 Ore + 2 Sheep for 5 Brick + 2 Sheep \u2014 effectively offering 3 Ore for 5 Brick. That implies they value Ore > Brick. I should exploit this by trying to acquire Ore at a favorable rate, perhaps offering Brick if the return is sufficient.\n\n8. **Optimal Trade Targets**: Since Ore is highest value, acquiring even 1 additional Ore significantly boosts total value. My current offers (e.g., 10 Wheat for 2 Ore) are fair (10\u00d75=50 for 2\u00d733=66), meaning I gain value. Rejection may be due to player 1\u2019s scarcity of Ore.\n\n9. **Adjusting Strategy**: Since direct Ore-for-Wheat/Brick trades are failing, consider offering a small amount of a mid-value resource (e.g., Sheep) to sweeten deals, or request less per trade to seem more reasonable.\n\n10. **Risk of Over-Trading**: Do not give away too much high-quantity valuable resource (Brick) without sufficient return. Brick is 25\u2014very valuable. Trading 4 Brick (100 value) for 1 Ore (33) is a losing trade.\n\nConclusion: My last offer (4 Brick for 1 Ore) was highly unfavorable \u2014 I lost value. I must stop offering high-value resources for low returns. Instead, focus on using low-value surplus (Wheat) or moderate-value surplus (Brick, if carefully managed) to acquire Ore.\n\nBest strategy: Use Wheat (lowest value per unit) in larger quantities to trade for Ore. For example: 6 Wheat (30 value) for 1 Ore (33) is nearly fair and acceptable. Or bundle small Sheep (12) with Wheat to make offers more enticing without sacrificing value.\n\nRevised Offer: Offer surplus Wheat and perhaps a small Sheep to get Ore, but ensure net value gain.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]  \n(Value given: 8\u00d75 + 1\u00d712 = 52; Value received: 33 \u2192 net loss? 52 \u2192 33 = bad)\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s a loss. Not good.\n\nBetter: Aim to receive more than I give.\n\nOre is 33. So to gain value, must give <33 in value.\n\nIdeal: Give 6 Wheat (30 value) for 1 Ore (33) \u2192 +3 value.\n\nBut may be rejected as too tight.\n\nAlternatively: 7 Wheat (35) for 1 Ore (33) is slight loss but may be accepted. Not ideal.\n\nWait \u2014 if I have surplus Wheat, slight loss for liquidity or strategic positioning might be worth it? But goal is total value increase.\n\nBest: Try to get 2 Ore for 5 Brick (125 value given) \u2192 2\u00d733=66 \u2192 large loss.\n\nNo.\n\nReverse: Player 1 wanted 5 Brick for 3 Ore earlier? That would be great for me: give 5 Brick (125) for 3 Ore (99) \u2192 loss.\n\nWait \u2014 they offered 3 Ore for 5 Brick. That means they are willing to *give* Ore for Brick? But Ore is more valuable! That offer benefits me if I *receive* Ore.\n\nBut in their offer to me: Offered 3 Ore, 2 Sheep -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep. So they give 3 Ore + 2 Sheep (3\u00d733 + 2\u00d712 = 99+24=123) for 5 Brick + 2 Sheep (125+24=149) \u2014 they lose value. They are overvaluing Brick?\n\nOr maybe they need Brick desperately.\n\nKey Insight: Player 1 may value Brick more than Ore. So they are willing to trade high-value Ore for slightly lower-value Brick.\n\nIf so, I should *accept* such offers \u2014 trade Brick for Ore!\n\nBut I rejected their offer of 3 Ore, 2 Sheep for 5 Brick, 2 Sheep.\n\nThat offer: I would give 5 Brick, 2 Sheep (125+24=149) for 3 Ore, 2 Sheep (99+24=123) \u2192 net loss of 26 value. So rejection was correct.\n\nBut perhaps I can flip it: offer *less* Brick for *more* Ore.\n\nFor example: [Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]\n\nValue: give 75, get 66 \u2192 still loss.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively: use Wheat.\n\nMaximize Ore acquisition via low-value resource.\n\nBest feasible: Offer 7 Wheat for 1 Ore (35 for 33) \u2014 slight loss, but may be acceptable to player if they need Wheat.\n\nBut I have 17 Wheat \u2014 surplus.\n\nAlternatively: 6 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (33) \u2192 gain 3 value. Fair and beneficial.\n\nBut will it be accepted?\n\nPlayer 1 previously rejected 10 Wheat for 2 Ore (50 for 66) \u2014 a good deal for them! Why?\n\nPossibly they are low on Ore.\n\nSo they may not have Ore to trade.\n\nThen I should target trading for other high-value resources? But Ore is the highest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe trade for Wood or Sheep? But I have Wood: 13, value 12; Sheep: 8, value 12 \u2014 medium.\n\nBrick and Ore most valuable.\n\nWait \u2014 I have 25 Brick, each worth 25. That\u2019s very high.\n\nIf I have excess, I could trade some for Ore.\n\nBut must gain value.\n\nFor example: [Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore] \u2192 25+5=30 for 33 \u2192 +3 value. Good.\n\nAcceptable?\n\nOr [Offer: 2 Brick -> 3 Sheep] \u2192 50 for 36 \u2192 loss.\n\nBad.\n\nOnly make value-positive trades.\n\nSince player seems reluctant to trade Ore, maybe try trading Brick for other mid-value items to free up flexibility?\n\nBut goal is to increase total value \u2014 so only valuable trades help.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps player is trying to hoard Ore.\n\nAlternate idea: I have lots of Brick (25). Maybe offer a trade that gives Brick for a combination that includes Ore.\n\nBut I need to receive more value than I give.\n\nBest current opportunity: try to get 1 Ore for less than 33 in value.\n\nOptions:\n\n- 6 Wheat (30) + 1 Sheep (12) = 42 for 1 Ore (33) \u2192 loss. No.\n- 7 Wheat (35) for 1 Ore (33) \u2192 loss of 2.\n- 1 Wood (12) + 4 Wheat (20) = 32 for 1 Ore (33) \u2192 gain 1. Good.\n\nThat\u2019s positive: give 32, get 33.\n\nBut Wood is valuable (12), and I only have 13.\n\nStill, small sacrifice.\n\nBetter: 5 Wheat (25) + 1 Wood (12) = 37 \u2192 too much.\n\n6 Wheat (30) + 1 Wood (12) = 42 \u2192 way over.\n\nWait \u2014 6 Wheat = 30. Need 33. So any package giving <32.99 in value for 33 is break-even or gain.\n\nSo: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore] \u2192 give 30, get 33 \u2192 +3. Efficient.\n\nI have 17 Wheat \u2014 can afford.\n\nWhy was 10 Wheat for 2 Ore rejected? That\u2019s 50 for 66 \u2014 very good for recipient.\n\nConclusion: Player 1 either lacks Ore or prefers not to trade it.\n\nSo I should either:\n\n- Keep offering favorable Ore-for-Wheat deals, signaling willingness.\n- Try trading my surplus Brick for something else, but only if value-positive.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe trade Sheep or Wood, but I don't have surplus.\n\nAlternatively, accept that Ore may be scarce and consider trading for Brick if I could get it for under 25, but I already have 25.\n\nNo.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps other players (if any) but only Player 1 mentioned.\n\nStuck with Player 1.\n\nTry again with a highly favorable offer.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore] \u2192 35 for 33 \u2192 slight loss, but may entice.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nWait \u2014 I have 25 Brick. Value 25. Ore is 33. So to get 1 Ore, I must give resources totaling <33.\n\nAny combo under 33.\n\nBest: Use only Wheat: 6 Wheat = 30 < 33 \u2192 good.\n\nSo [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore] is ideal: +3 value, uses surplus.\n\nI have 17 - previous offers: I previously offered 5, then 5, then 10 \u2014 total 20 Wheat offered? But only 17.\n\nWait \u2014 inventory says I currently have 17 Wheat.\n\nBut I offered:\n- 5 Wheat\n- then 5 Wheat\n- then 10 Wheat\n\nThat\u2019s 20, but only 17 \u2014 impossible.\n\nAh \u2014 offers were not accepted, so resources not deducted. So yes, I still have 17 Wheat.\n\nSo offering 6 is fine.\n\nBut prior 10 Wheat for 2 Ore (i.e., 5 Wheat per Ore) was rejected \u2014 even better for them.\n\nSo why? Maybe they don\u2019t want Wheat, or they lack Ore.\n\nPerhaps they need specific quantities.\n\nAlternative: Offer something I have less of to show compromise.\n\nBut best action: Try a clean, fair offer that gives marginal gain.\n\nSince player might suspect manipulation, make offer more attractive.\n\nBut I must not lose value.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a better way?\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (25) + 1 Wheat (5) = 30 for 1 Ore (33) \u2192 +3 value.\n\nSimilar efficiency.\n\nBut gives up Brick \u2014 more valuable per unit than Wheat.\n\nWheat is better to spend.\n\nSo prefer Wheat-based offers.\n\nFinal Decision: Try [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nIf that keeps being rejected, may need to use mix or wait.\n\nBut must continue trying.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Knowledge  \n1. Know the true marginal worth of each resource to you right now.  \n   - Ore 39 value each is your single most valuable card.  \n   - Brick 30 is second.  \n   - Wheat 5 is your least-valued surplus (you have 22 of them).  \n   Any trade must move value *per card* strongly upward; otherwise holding is better.\n\n2.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: Ore (value 33) is your most valuable resource per unit, followed by Brick (25), then Wood and Sheep (12 each), and Wheat (5). Prioritize acquiring more Ore if possible, and avoid giving away too much Ore unless highly compensated.\n\n2. **Abundance vs. Scarcity**: You have a surplus of Brick (25) and Wheat (17), which are higher in quantity. Brick, while valuable, is abundant in your inventory\u2014making it a strong candidate for trade. Wheat is low value but high quantity, making it useful for bundling to acquire more critical resources like Ore.\n\n3. **Relative Value for Trading Partners**: Other players may be in need of Wheat or Brick (commonly used in builds). Offering Brick or Wheat in exchange for Ore leverages your abundance to fill others' scarcities.\n\n4. **Efficient Exchange Ratios**: Historically, players are more likely to accept trades that appear balanced. Since Ore is worth 33 and Brick is worth 25, a 1:1 exchange of Brick for Ore undervalues Ore. Similarly, Wheat (5) is much less valuable than Ore (33). Therefore, offering multiple lower-value items for one high-value item (like Ore) is reasonable\u2014but must be within believable ratios.\n\n5. **Trade Rejection Patterns**: Multiple offers for Ore have been rejected, especially when offering only 4\u20135 Wheat or 4 Brick per 1 Ore. This suggests Player 1 demands better compensation. The recent offer from Player 1: 14 Wheat \u2192 3 Ore, 1 Brick implies they value Ore highly and may only trade it in bulk for large returns.\n\n6. **Counter-Offer Strategy**: Since direct offers for Ore are failing, consider bundling your excess (Wheat and Brick) in a more attractive ratio, or offer Sheep (value 12) to sweeten the deal.\n\n7. **Opportunity Cost**: Holding onto Brick and Wheat has diminishing returns if unused. Trading some for Ore increases your total portfolio value significantly.\n\n8. **Anchoring and Framing**: Propose a trade that appears fair or even generous to increase acceptance chance. For example, offering more total value in multiple resources but requesting high-value Ore can still net a profit if structured right.\n\nApplication of Knowledge:  \nYou need Ore. Player 1 is willing to offer 3 Ore for 14 Wheat and 1 Brick. That values 3 Ore at ~153 total value, while 14 Wheat (14\u00d75=70) + 1 Brick (25) = 95\u2014so their offer undervalues their Ore. However, they may be testing. Instead, make a counter-offer that gives them value while still increasing your net worth.\n\nConsider: Offer 12 Wheat + 1 Brick \u2192 2 Ore  \nValue offered: (12\u00d75) + 25 = 60 + 25 = 85  \nValue received: 2\u00d733 = 66  \nThis appears fair or slightly generous to them. You gain 66 in value, lose 85\u2014but you have surplus Wheat, and acquiring Ore boosts your strategic position. However, net value loss\u2014risky.\n\nBetter: Offer 10 Wheat + 3 Brick \u2192 3 Ore  \nValue offered: 50 + 75 = 125  \nValue received: 99  \nStill not profitable in pure value, but moves inventory.\n\nAlternatively, aim for higher efficiency: trade Sheep and Wheat (lower utility) for Ore.\n\nBest Option:  \nOffer: 8 Wheat + 2 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore  \nValue offered: (8\u00d75) + (2\u00d712) = 40 + 24 = 64  \nValue received: 66 \u2192 **Net gain of 2 total value**  \nThis is efficient, uses surplus Wheat and some Sheep (you have 8), and requests a reasonable amount of Ore.\n\nThis trade increases your total resource value, uses abundant resources, and aligns with fair exchange principles.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",
