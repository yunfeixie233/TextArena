Marginal Utility vs. Absolute Value  \n   A pure \u201cmore total points\u201d strategy doesn\u2019t automatically mean \u201ckeep the expensive stuff\u201d; if exchanging 1 Ore (35) for 2 Brick (52 total) raises overall value, it\u2019s wise.\n\n3. Surplus vs. Shortage  \n   I have a high surplus of Ore (8 units) that exceeds my immediate need. Brick is only at 6, just below my Ore quantity, but might be bottlenecked in many games that require pairs. Increasing Brick supplies could unlock higher-tier trades.\n\n4. Trade Structure Principles  \n   a. 2-for-1 and 3-for-2 swaps demonstrate \u201cgive cheap, get dear\u201d if proportions fit.  \n   b.

Sheep are lucrative throw-ins because 3 Sheep (36 total) matches roughly 1 Ore in raw trade value, but negotiators see Sheep as \u201ccheap filler\u201d so they\u2019re more likely to accept.\n\nApply Strategy:\n\nStructure: [Sheep-heavy packaging] + [thin Ore spend] \u2192 [Brick-heavy return]\n\nCurrent inventory calculation (after trade):  \n- I can afford to move 3 Sheep and 2 Ore.  \n  Losing 2 Ore (70 pts) plus 3 Sheep (36 pts) = 106 offered value.  \n- Requesting 5 Brick (5\u00d726 = 130 pts) and 0-1 Sheep back to sweeten liquidity (some Sheep upfront lowers Brick overdraft feel for opponent).

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nBased on my current situation in the Negotiation Game, here are the key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are most relevant:\n\n1. **Value-Based Decision Making**: The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I must calculate the net value of any trade by comparing the value of resources I'm receiving against those I'm giving up. For example, using the provided values (e.g., Sheep at 16 per unit, Brick at 27 per unit), I should only accept trades where the incoming value exceeds the outgoing value. This ensures long-term gains, especially in a finite game with 10 turns.\n\n2. **Avoid Unfavorable Trades**: Not every offer is worth accepting. If a trade results in a net loss of value, I should deny it outright to preserve my resources. This ties into opportunity cost\u2014resources I give up could be used in future trades or for other game purposes, so I shouldn't deplete high-value assets unnecessarily.\n\n3. **Negotiation as a Tool**: In a multi-turn game, I don't have to accept the first offer. Instead, I can deny and potentially counter with my own offer to seek better terms. For instance, if an offer is close to fair, I could propose a modified version that benefits me more. However, I should only counter if it aligns with my resource strengths (e.g., I have high quantities of Brick and Sheep, which I can leverage).\n\n4. **Resource Strengths and Scarcity**: I should play to my advantages\u2014my highest-value resources are Ore (36 per unit) and Brick (27 per unit), with substantial quantities. Trades should aim to acquire resources that complement my portfolio or have higher future utility. Conversely, I should be cautious about trading away abundant but high-value items like Brick unless the return is superior.\n\n5. **Game Context and Risk Management**: With only 10 turns, I need to be strategic about early trades. Denying a poor offer early allows me to wait for better opportunities or initiate my own trades. Always consider the other player's perspective\u2014they might be trying to exploit my resources, so maintaining a defensive stance initially can be wise.\n\nIn summary, prioritize trades that yield a positive net value, leverage my resource abundance, and use denial or counter-offers to negotiate effectively.\n\n### Trading Decision\n\nAfter evaluating the incoming offer from Player 0 (Offered: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> Requested: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep), I calculated the values:\n\n- Value of resources offered to me: 3 Sheep (3 \u00d7 16 = 48) + 2 Ore (2 \u00d7 36 = 72) = Total 120\n- Value of resources requested from me: 5 Brick (5 \u00d7 27 = 135) + 2 Sheep (2 \u00d7 16 = 32) = Total 167\n\nThis results in a net loss of 167 - 120 = 47 value for me, which violates the principle of increasing total value. Therefore, I will not accept this unfavorable trade.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\nBefore making a trading decision, I've generated relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation based on my current situation. Here are the key principles, strategies, and insights:\n\n1. **Value-Based Decision Making**: In resource trading, always prioritize trades that increase your total resource value. Calculate the net value gain by comparing the value of resources you're offering versus those you're receiving. For example, if the value per unit of a resource is low (like Wheat at approximately 0.32 value per unit based on my totals), it's wise to trade it away for higher-value resources (like Ore at about 1.71 per unit). This ensures you're only accepting or proposing deals that result in a net positive for your portfolio.\n\n2. **Assess Scarcity and Abundance**: Trade resources you have in surplus for those that are scarcer or more valuable to you. I have high quantities of Brick (24 qty, high value per unit \u22481.125), Sheep (21 qty, \u22480.76 per unit), and Ore (21 qty, \u22481.71 per unit), so I should be cautious about giving these away. Conversely, I have Wheat (19 qty, low value per unit \u22480.32), which I could use as leverage in trades without significantly impacting my overall value.\n\n3. **Negotiation Strategies**: Aim for mutual benefit but prioritize your own gains, especially in a limited-turn game (only 10 turns total). Reject unfavorable offers and counter with proposals that flip the value in your favor. For instance, if an incoming offer undervalues your resources, deny it and make a counter-offer that seeks higher-value items. Avoid accepting losses early, as it could set a precedent for future turns. Additionally, use information from previous offers\u2014Player 0 has shown interest in Brick\u2014to your advantage by proposing trades that address their needs while maximizing your value.\n\n4. **Risk Management in Limited Turns**: With only 10 turns, focus on efficient trades that build value quickly. Deny offers that result in a net loss and use counter-offers to test the other player's flexibility. If a trade doesn't improve your position, it's better to pass or propose something better, as prolonged suboptimal deals could waste turns.\n\n5. **Insights from Game History**: From the previous interactions, Player 0 has twice tried to acquire Brick (first in their initial offer and now), indicating they value it highly. This gives me leverage, but I must ensure any trade I propose values my resources appropriately. For example, their current offer (3 Wheat for 2 Brick) is unfavorable to me, as the value I'm giving (\u22482.25) far exceeds what I'm receiving (\u22480.96), so rejecting it aligns with value maximization.\n\nOverall, this knowledge emphasizes calculated, self-interested trading to ensure long-term gains.\n\n### Trading Decision\nApplying the generated knowledge, I've evaluated the incoming offer from Player 0: They are offering 3 Wheat (estimated value \u22480.96) in exchange for my 2 Brick (estimated value \u22482.25). This would decrease my total resource value, as I'm losing more value than I'm gaining, which violates the principle of value-based decision making. Therefore, I will deny this offer.\n\nTo proactively increase my value, I'll make a counter-offer. I have an abundance of Sheep (21 qty, value per unit \u22480.76), which has moderate value, and I can trade it for something higher-value like Ore (which has the highest value per unit \u22481.71 for me). This aligns with assessing scarcity and negotiation strategies, as it proposes a mutually beneficial trade while prioritizing my gains.\n\nMy action: [Deny] [Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Ore]",

But value is only useful if the quantity is useful, so \u201cmarginal unit value\u201d drives trade decisions.  \n2. Gains-from-trade: A trade is favorable only if the loss in total value given up is outweighed by the gain received.  \n3. Relative scarcity drives bargaining power. My Ore is high and plentiful (8 units at value 35). Player 1 asked 3 Sheep for 2 Ore; 2 Ore value = 2\u00d735 = 70, 3 Sheep value = 3\u00d712 = 36.

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles, strategies, and insights are crucial, especially in a competitive game with limited turns (only 10 in total). Based on my current situation, where I have abundant resources like Brick (24 qty) and need to maximize the total value of my holdings, here's the relevant knowledge:\n\n1. **Value-Based Decision Making**: Always calculate the net value gain or loss for any trade from your perspective. Trade only if the value of resources received exceeds the value of resources given, based on your personal valuations. For instance, my resources have varying values per unit (e.g., Ore at 36 is my most valuable, while Wheat at 6 is the least), so I should prioritize acquiring high-value resources and offloading low-value ones. This ensures long-term gains, as seen in games like Catan, where efficient trading amplifies your position.\n\n2. **Assess Scarcity and Abundance**: Trade resources you have in surplus for those that are scarcer or more valuable to you. I have high quantities of Brick (24 qty), Sheep (21 qty), and Ore (21 qty), which could be leveraged. Conversely, I should avoid depleting resources that are critical or already low, like Wood (15 qty). In negotiation, use your abundance to make offers that entice the other player while protecting your interests.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics and Counter-Offers**: Don't accept unfair offers; instead, use them as a basis for counter-offers. Historical patterns (e.g., Player 0 repeatedly requesting Brick) reveal their preferences, allowing me to exploit this. Strategies include starting with offers that favor you but are still plausible, as outright demands can stall negotiations. In a turn-limited game, be proactive\u2014reject poor offers and propose alternatives to build momentum.\n\n4. **Risk and Game Context**: With only 10 turns, prioritize quick, positive-value trades to accumulate wealth early. Analyze past interactions: Player 0 has shown interest in Brick but rejected my previous offer (3 Sheep for 2 Ore), indicating they may value Ore highly or find my terms unbalanced. Aim for reciprocity\u2014propose trades that could be mutually beneficial but tilted in your favor to encourage acceptance without revealing weakness.\n\n5. **Psychological Insights**: In competitive settings, players often anchor on their initial offers. By denying an offer and countering, I can shift the negotiation. Always maintain a poker face\u2014don't overcommit resources in one turn, as this could weaken future positions.\n\nApplying this to my situation: Player 0's latest offer (2 Ore for 3 Brick) results in a net value loss for me (2 Ore = 72 value vs. 3 Brick = 81 value), so it's not in my interest. I should deny it and counter with an offer that gives me a net gain, such as trading my abundant Brick for their Ore, while considering their past demands.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\n\nEvaluating Player 0's offer: Giving 3 Brick (81 value) for 2 Ore (72 value) would decrease my total resource value by 9, violating the value-based decision principle. Therefore, I must deny this offer to protect my assets.\n\nNow, applying negotiation tactics: Player 0 wants Brick, as evidenced by their repeated requests, so I'll use my surplus Brick to propose a counter-offer. I want to acquire more Ore (high value at 36 per unit), so I'll offer 2 Brick (54 value) for 2 Ore (72 value), resulting in a net gain of 18 value for me. This is a slight adjustment from their offer, making it more favorable to them than my previous rejected offer (3 Sheep for 2 Ore) while ensuring I come out ahead. This proactive approach maximizes my gains in the limited turns.\n\nMy trading decision: Deny the incoming offer and make a new counter-offer.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 2 Ore]",

Marginal-value fallacy  \n   After several trades have been rejected, both players are signaling that the offered exchange ratios are unattractive. A successful offer must meet or slightly exceed the opponent\u2019s private value gap, not merely improve on spin-off value.\n\n3. Deal sweeteners & \u201cwhole-package\u201d psychology  \n   People often reject a deal if it looks lopsided numerically even if values are equal. Including an extra low-denomination unit (a \u201csweetener\u201d) can flip rejection into acceptance without moving the real needle on total value.\n\n4. Scarcity plays  \n   Brick is my scarcest resource (6 units) and also my opponent\u2019s scarcest revealed resource (they keep asking for Brick). They may overvalue Brick relative to its 26-point face value. Conversely, I have more of Ore (8) than anyone else. Selling one Ore for more than one Brick would strictly increase my value count.\n\n5. Inventory balance check after proposed trade  \n   - Current Brick: 6. Goal is 8\u20139 to give room for defensive play without dropping below a safe reserve.  \n   - Current Ore: 8.

I must get at least a 2-for-1 ratio to compensate.  \n- The opponent has rejected 2-for-1 Ore \u2192 Brick twice already. They likely want 1-for-1 or worse. The only way to bridge the gap is to add a low-value Wheat as a sweetener.  \n\nA 1 Ore + 1 Wheat \u2192 2 Brick package looks numerically as a 2-for-2 exchange but in value:  \n\u2013 I lose 35 (Ore) + 6 (Wheat) = 41 value.  \n\u2013 I gain 2 \u00d7 26 = 52 value.  \nNet gain for me: 52 \u2212 41 = +11 value and still keeps each party\u2019s quantities reasonable.\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nBefore making a trading decision, I need to outline key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that apply to my current situation. Based on standard negotiation games like this one, here's a summary of the most relevant knowledge:\n\n- **Maximize Net Value**: The primary goal is to ensure that any trade increases the total value of your resources. Calculate the net value gain by subtracting the value of resources you're giving from the value of resources you're receiving. Always prioritize trades where the incoming resources have a higher total value than what you're offering, considering per-unit values (e.g., Ore at 36 is more valuable than Brick at 27). This is crucial in a finite game with only 10 turns, as poor trades could leave you at a disadvantage later.\n\n- **Assess Resource Abundance and Scarcity**: Trade resources you have in excess for those that are scarcer or more valuable to you. I have high quantities of Brick (24) and Sheep (21), which I can leverage as bargaining chips. In contrast, I should seek resources like Ore (which I have 21 of but is highly valuable at 36 per unit) if it allows for greater overall value growth. Avoid depleting scarce resources unnecessarily.\n\n- **Negotiation Strategy and Reciprocity**: Start with offers that heavily favor you, but be mindful of the other player's perspective based on past interactions. From the history, Player 0 has repeatedly offered low-value resources (e.g., Wheat at 6) for my high-value ones (e.g., Brick at 27), and they've rejected my offers, indicating they might value their Ore highly or need Brick desperately. Use this to your advantage by making counteroffers that are fair but tilted in your favor. If an incoming offer is unbalanced (e.g., net loss for you), deny it and propose a counteroffer to build momentum without wasting turns.\n\n- **Risk and Turn Management**: With only 10 turns total, avoid accepting unfavorable deals that don't progress your position. Deny offers that result in a net loss and follow up with your own proposals to keep the negotiation active. Past rejections suggest both players are cautious, so persistence with value-focused offers could wear down resistance. Additionally, diversify your trades to avoid over-reliance on one resource type.\n\n- **Psychological Insights**: People (or AI players) often reject unfair trades, so frame your offers to appear reasonable. For example, if Player 0 keeps asking for Brick, they might be willing to overpay slightly. Always evaluate incoming offers critically to avoid emotional decisions.\n\nThis knowledge directly applies to my situation, where I must evaluate Player 0's latest offer and decide on a response, potentially followed by my own offer.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nNow, applying this knowledge to the current situation:\n\n- **Evaluate Incoming Offer**: Player 0's offer is: Offered items: 1 Ore (value: 36) and 1 Wheat (value: 6) -> Requested items: 2 Brick (value: 27 each, total 54).  \n  - Value I'm receiving: 1 Ore (36) + 1 Wheat (6) = 42 total value.  \n  - Value I'm giving: 2 Brick (54 total value).  \n  - Net value change: 42 - 54 = -12 (a loss of 12 value points).  \n  This offer violates the principle of maximizing net value, as it's clearly unfavorable. Based on scarcity assessment, I have plenty of Brick to trade, but not at a loss. Therefore, I should [Deny] this offer, as accepting it would waste a turn and reduce my overall resources' value.\n\n- **Decide on Next Action**: With turns limited, I should follow up with a counteroffer that benefits me. From the history, Player 0 seems interested in Brick, so I'll leverage my abundance of it. I want to gain high-value resources like Ore. A balanced offer could be: Offer 1 Brick (value: 27) for 1 Ore (value: 36), which gives me a net gain of 9 value points while appearing reasonable to Player 0 based on their past offers. This aligns with reciprocity and turn management strategies.\n\nFinal Action: [Deny] the incoming offer, then make my own offer.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. Know your marginal value curve  \n   - Every resource produces diminishing returns past a certain point.  \n   - My Ore (35 value) is the single highest-value unit and far exceeds Brick\u2019s 26. Therefore trading Ore for Brick directly lowers total value per unit traded; the trade would have to be nonlinear (I receive >1 Brick per Ore) to compensate.  \n\n2. Identify excess vs scarcity visually  \n   - Shortages: Brick (only 6) \u2013 this limits any building action that needs large amounts.  \n   - Surpluses: Sheep & Wheat are the lowest per-unit value in my inventory; I can spare at least 3-4 of each without materially hurting future combinations.\n\n3. Value add-ups through substitution set  \n   Brick becomes more powerful whenever its marginal-replacement cost (i.e., the 26 I assigned) is undercut. Currently:  \n   \u2013 To swap 1 Ore \u2192 1 Brick costs 35-26 = 9 lost value \u2192 bad.  \n   \u2013 To swap 1 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick costs 6-26 = +20 gained value \u2192 excellent (but Brick owner is rational and will never accept).  \n   Therefore exchanging \u201clow-value grains\u201d for high-demand Brick is unlikely in a straight 1-for-1 offer.\n\n4. Rival\u2019s revealed preferences  \n   Player 1 has twice proposed trades that give me Brick and ask for Ore \u2013 always either 1:1 or even slightly negative (2 bricks for 2 ore). That shows Player 1 perceives Ore as ~3.5 value per unit less than I do and views Brick equal or higher than Ore. Since I value Ore more than Brick, I should not accept 1-for-1 exchanges.\n\n5. Composition pricing rule  \n   When you bundle surplus low-value units with one high-value unit (known as \u201csweetener bundling\u201d), small bricks of value can be shifted. A rational opponent may assess the bundle at average marginal value not peak, making trades viable.\n\n6. Deadline and incremental gains  \n   This is turn 5 of 10; small incremental gains compound. Rejecting every current offer (-0 gain) is worse than extracting even +2-3 value if the risk of getting worse deals later rises.\n\nApply knowledge to decision:\n\nAccepting 1 Brick for 1 Ore would transfer 26 - 35 = \u20139 value \u2013 clearly unprofitable. It also moves me opposite to the problem (I want more Brick, not give away Ore). Therefore sacrifice no Ore at 1:1.\n\nCounter-offer: offer the opponent surplus low-value units instead, pushing them toward Brick without touching Ore.  \nProposal that has +EV for me:\n\nTrading 3 Wheat (value 6 each) for 2 Brick (26 each) yields 3\u00d76 = 18 out \u2192 2\u00d726 = 52 in, net +34. Each unit of Brick gained adds 20 more than Wheat lost \u2013 highly desirable.\n\nTranslation:  \n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 2 Brick]\n\nThat exchange is profitable and Player 1\u2019s past behaviour shows wheat is scarce for them (they repeatedly ask for resources that enable future building).",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are relevant to my current situation as Player 1, where my goal is to increase the total value of my resources. First, **value-based evaluation** is crucial: I should only accept trades where the value of resources I receive exceeds the value of what I give, based on my assigned values (e.g., Wheat: 6 per unit, Ore: 36 per unit). This ensures net gains and aligns with basic economic principles like opportunity cost\u2014avoiding trades that deplete my overall wealth.\n\nSecond, **understanding supply and demand dynamics** helps: I have abundant resources like Brick (24 qty, high value at 27 per unit) and Sheep (21 qty, value 16 per unit), which I can leverage as bargaining chips, while Player 0 has repeatedly offered Wheat and Ore for my Brick, indicating their scarcity or need. I should exploit this by demanding more valuable resources (e.g., Ore at 36 value) in return for my excess items.\n\nThird, **negotiation tactics** are essential in a limited-turn game (only 10 turns total): Start with firm but reasonable counter-offers to build momentum, avoid accepting unfavorable deals to maintain leverage, and use rejection as a signal to encourage better offers from the other player. For instance, if an offer is imbalanced, deny it and propose a counter that flips the value in my favor. Additionally, **risk management** applies\u2014since turns are finite, I should prioritize trades that provide immediate value gains without depleting key resources, while monitoring patterns in Player 0's offers (e.g., their repeated requests for Brick suggest desperation).\n\nFinally, **psychological insights** matter: Players often escalate offers over time, so denying poor deals can lead to improvements. In summary, my strategy should focus on maximizing value per trade, using my resource abundance strategically, and maintaining a patient, calculated approach to negotiations.\n\n### Apply Knowledge\n\nAnalyzing Player 0's latest offer\u2014Offered: 3 Wheat (value: 3 * 6 = 18) -> Requested: 2 Brick (value: 2 * 27 = 54)\u2014shows a clear net loss for me, as I'm giving up resources worth 54 for ones worth only 18. This violates the principle of value-based evaluation, as it decreases my total resource value. Based on supply and demand, Player 0's persistent interest in Brick indicates they value it highly, so I should deny this offer and make a counter-offer that benefits me, such as trading my excess Brick for their more valuable Ore.\n\nGiven my abundance of Brick (24 qty) and the high value of Ore (36 per unit), I'll propose a simple, balanced counter-offer: Offer 1 Brick (value: 27) for 1 Ore (value: 36), which would increase my net value by 9 per unit traded. This aligns with negotiation tactics to escalate positively while managing risk in the limited turns. Therefore, I will deny the incoming offer and make this new offer to Player 0.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",
