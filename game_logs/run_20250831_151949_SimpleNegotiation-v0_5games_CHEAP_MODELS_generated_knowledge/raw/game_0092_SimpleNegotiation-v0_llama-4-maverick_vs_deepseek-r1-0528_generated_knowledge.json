      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to understand the current situation and apply relevant principles of resource trading and negotiation.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of my current resources:\n- Wheat: 24 * 6 = 144\n- Wood: 7 * 11 = 77\n- Sheep: 9 * 15 = 135\n- Brick: 5 * 22 = 110\n- Ore: 16 * 35 = 560\n\nTotal value = 144 + 77 + 135 + 110 + 560 = 1026\n\nTo increase the total value, I should look for trades that give me resources of higher value or more quantity of resources that are relatively valuable to me.\n\nKey principles and strategies relevant to my situation include:\n1. **Maximizing Value**: Focus on acquiring resources with higher values or quantities that can be used to negotiate for higher-value resources.\n2. **Resource Surplus and Deficit**: Identify resources I have in surplus and those I am short of. I can offer surplus resources to get what I need or to get resources of higher value.\n3. **Negotiation Tactics**: Be prepared to negotiate. If I don't have an immediate need, I can wait and observe what others are offering or seeking.\n4. **Assessing Offers**: Carefully evaluate any incoming offers based on whether they increase my total resource value.\n\nGiven my current resources:\n- I have a significant amount of Wheat and Ore, which are 24 and 16 in quantity, respectively.\n- Ore is particularly valuable at 35 per unit.\n\nLet's analyze potential trades:\n- Offering some Wheat (lower value) for other resources could be beneficial if it results in gaining more valuable resources.\n- My Ore is very valuable; trading it for an even more valuable resource or a significant quantity of another valuable resource could be beneficial.\n\nSince it's the first turn and I don't have any incoming offers to react to, I will make an initial offer. Let's consider trading some of my Wheat (the least valuable resource per unit) for a resource that could potentially increase my total value.\n\nFor example, offering Wheat for Brick or Ore (though I already have a lot of Ore) could be considered. However, since Ore is very valuable and I already have a substantial amount, trading it directly might not be the best initial strategy unless I'm getting an exceptionally good deal.\n\nLet's make an offer:\nI have 24 Wheat and could offer some for a valuable resource. If I offer 4 Wheat (total value = 4*6 = 24) for 1 Brick (value = 22), it's not a good deal because I'm giving up more value than I'm getting. However, if I can get more quantity or a more valuable resource, it could work.\n\nLet's consider an offer: '[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' is not a good trade because Ore is very valuable (35 per unit), and 5 Wheat (value = 30) is less than 1 Ore. However, if I were to offer Wheat for something like Brick or Sheep, it might be more feasible.\n\nAn example offer could be: '[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'. Here, I'm offering 3 Wheat (value = 18) for 1 Sheep (value = 15), which isn't a great trade for me since I'm getting less value. However, it could be a starting point.\n\nA potentially better strategy is to look for opportunities to trade my less valuable resources for more valuable ones directly or indirectly.\n\nLet's directly propose a trade that could be beneficial. Since I have a lot of Wheat and it's not very valuable per unit, I'll look to trade it for something more valuable.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep]' is a potential trade. Here, I'm giving up (4*6) + (1*11) = 24 + 11 = 35 for 2 Sheep (2*15 = 30). This isn't a great trade for me since I'm losing value.\n\nLet's directly make a more reasonable offer:\n'[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' could be considered. Here, I'm giving up 3*15 = 45 for 1 Ore (value = 35), which is not a good trade.\n\nAfter considering various options, a reasonable initial offer is tricky without knowing what others are looking for. Let's try to propose a trade that might be beneficial:\n'[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood]'.\n\nHere, I'm giving up 6 Wheat (6*6 = 36) for 1 Brick (22) and 1 Wood (11), totaling 33. This is still not a great trade for me, as I'm losing value.\n\nHowever, let's adjust our strategy to an offer that is more balanced. Given that it's the start, let's make a more conservative and potentially beneficial trade.\n\n'[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' translates to giving up 48 for 35, which is still not beneficial.\n\nLet's think about trading Wood or Sheep for something more valuable.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]' means giving up 2*11 = 22 for 1 Brick (22), which is a neutral trade, but it doesn't increase my value.\n\nUpon reflection, an initial beneficial trade isn't straightforward. Let's make an offer that could potentially be accepted and is somewhat reasonable:\n'[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 2 Brick]'.\n\nHere, I'm giving up (3*15) + (2*6) = 45 + 12 = 57 for 2 Brick (2*22 = 44), which is still not a great trade.\n\nLet's simplify and directly propose a potentially beneficial trade.\n\nGiven the complexity and without an obvious beneficial trade, let's directly make an initial offer. A more straightforward trade is needed.\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]' is a potential starting point, though not ideal. It gives up 30 for 15.\n\nLet's directly choose a trade: '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Wood]'.\n\nHere, I'm offering 24 (4*6) for 11 (1*11), which is not a good trade.\n\nRevisiting the strategy, let's directly make a more reasonable initial offer. After analyzing, a reasonable trade is:\n'[Offer: 2 Ore, 3 Wheat -> 3 Sheep, 1 Brick]'.\n\nLet's directly simplify and make a decision. \n\n'[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 2 Wood]'.\n\nHere, the value given up is 7*6 = 42, and the value received is 2*11 = 22. This is not a good trade.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'll make a trade that might not be perfect but is a start.\n\nThe final decision for the first turn is:\n'[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'.\n\nI'm giving up 36 for 15, which is still not ideal. However, it's a start.\n\nLet's proceed with: '[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]'.",

Although the offer seems reasonable as it involves a gain for both parties (I gain 35 value for a loss of 30), the rejection suggests either they valued Ore more than I anticipated or they didn't have the Ore to spare.\n3. **Resource Surplus/Deficit**: I have a relatively high quantity of Wheat and Ore. Wheat is of low value, and while Ore is of high value, trading away too much Ore could decrease my total value significantly.\n4. **Negotiation Strategy**: Since my last offer was rejected, I should consider what could be a more appealing offer to Player 1. This involves either reducing the value I'm asking for or increasing the value I'm offering, or both.\n\n### Applying the Knowledge:\nGiven that my previous offer was rejected, I should reevaluate what I'm offering and what I'm asking for. Considering the values and the quantities I have:\n- I can afford to part with some Wheat or Sheep for a higher-value resource or a resource that complements my current stock better.\n- Ore is valuable, and I shouldn't give it away cheaply. However, I should be open to reasonable trades.\n\nSince Player 1 didn't make a new offer, I'll consider making another trade offer. One potential trade could involve offering Wheat (since I have a surplus and it's of lower value) for a resource that is either of higher value or more scarce for me.\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat for Brick, as Brick is of higher value than Wheat, and I have a relatively lower quantity of it.\n- Offer: 8 Wheat -> 2 Brick (since 1 Brick = 22, 2 Brick = 44; and 8 Wheat = 8*6 = 48, this might not be attractive. Let's adjust).\n- A more reasonable offer could be: 10 Wheat -> 1 Brick (10 Wheat = 60, 1 Brick = 22; this is not favorable for me).\n- Let's adjust again, thinking about offering less valuable resources for more valuable ones or equal value but scarce resources: Offering Sheep for Ore could be considered, but since I already have a substantial amount of Ore, this might not be the best.\n\nLet's directly propose a trade: \n- '[Offer: 6 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick]'.\n\nHere, I'm offering 6 Wheat (Value = 36) and 1 Wood (Value = 11), totaling 47 in value, for 2 Brick (Value = 44). This is relatively balanced and involves trading lower-value resources for higher-value ones, although the values are close.\n\n### Decision:\n'[Offer: 6 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick]'.\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds to this offer.",

Avoid depleting high-value resources unless the return is favorable.\n3. **Marginal Utility**: Excess quantities (e.g., Sheep at 18) reduce urgency to hold; offload them for resources with higher per-unit value.\n4. **Opponent Behavior**: Analyze trends\u2014Player 0's offers involve low-value Wheat for high-value resources.

Accept offers where the received resources have a higher combined value than the given resources, considering short-term and strategic long-term targets.\n2. **Resource Abundance Strategy**: Leverage surplus low-value resources (like Sheep and Wheat, which I have in high quantity) to acquire high-value resources (like Brick and Ore) if feasible. However, ensure such trades are value-positive.\n3. **Counteroffer Leverage**: If an opponent frequently requests a resource (e.g., Player 0 seeks Brick/Ore), propose counteroffers that overvalue your high-value resources in exchange for their low-value ones, aiming for maximum net value gain.\n4. **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid depleting critical high-value resources (Ore, Brick) excessively; maintain a buffer to retain flexibility.\n5. **Efficiency in Trade Design**: Optimize offers to entice acceptance\u2014e.g., package overabundant low-value resources (e.g., Sheep) for undervalued resources, while ensuring net gains align with core valuations.\n\n### Trading Decision\nI accept Player 0's latest offer (6 Wheat and 1 Wood for 1 Ore) as it yields a net value increase:\n- **Value Calculation**:  \n  - Lose: 1 Ore = -32  \n  - Gain: 6 Wheat (6 \u00d7 6 = 36) + 1 Wood (1 \u00d7 12 = 12) = +48  \n  - **Net Gain**: +16  \n\nAfter this trade, my resources become:  \n- Wheat: 18 \ud83c\udf3e (Value = 108)  \n- Wood: 8 \ud83e\udeb5 (Value = 96)  \n- Sheep: 18 \ud83d\udc11 (Value = 252)  \n- Brick: 10 \ud83e\uddf1 (Value = 250)  \n- Ore: 7 \u26cf\ufe0f (Value = 224)  \n- **Total Value**: 930 \u2b06\ufe0f (from 914)  \n\nI propose a new trade offer focused on converting surplus Brick for undervalued resources:  \n- **Offer**: [Offer: 1 Brick \u2192 5 Wheat, 1 Wood]  \n- **Rationale**:  \n  - Lose: 1 Brick = -25  \n  - Gain: 5 Wheat (5 \u00d7 6 = 30) + 1 Wood (1 \u00d7 12 = 12) = +42  \n  - **Net Gain**: +17  \n- **Strategic Fit**: Player 0 previously pursued Brick, increasing acceptance likelihood.

      "response": "### Knowledge Generation\nTo make informed trade decisions, I need to apply strategic negotiation principles based on my resource valuation and observed opponent behavior:\n\n1. **Value Optimization Principle**: Trade low-value surplus resources for high-value ones to maximize net gain. My goal is to increase total portfolio value (currently 930).  \n   - Highest-value resource: **Ore** (32/unit), then **Brick** (25/unit).  \n   - Lowest-value surplus: **Wheat** (6/unit, 18 units) and **Sheep** (14/unit, 18 units).  \n\n2. **Opponent Behavioral Insight**: Player 0 consistently offered Wheat and Wood for Brick/Ore, revealing:  \n   - They undervalue Ore relative to me (e.g., traded 6 Wheat + 1 Wood [value 48] for 1 Ore [32] last turn).  \n   - They actively seek Brick/Ore, suggesting scarcity on their side.  \n   - Wheat may be abundant/low-value for them, making it ideal for negotiations.  \n\n3. **Risk Mitigation**:  \n   - Avoid overpaying with Sheep (moderate value: 14) unless net gain exceeds 10%.  \n   - Prioritize Wheat-based trades to reduce excess (18 units) without significant value loss.  \n   - No existing offers need response\u2014this is my proactive turn to offer.  \n\n4. **Bargaining Leverage**:  \n   - Propose deals where my net gain is \u226515% per trade (offsetting rejection risk).  \n   - Capitalize on Player 0\u2019s Ore demand by offering \"discounted\" Wheat bundles compared to their historical offers.  \n\n### Trading Decision\nI propose:  \n**[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]**  \n\n**Rationale**:  \n- **Value Calculation**:  \n  - Trading away 4 Wheat: Loss = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24.  \n  - Gaining 1 Ore: Gain = 32.  \n  - **Net value increase**: 32 \u2212 24 = +8.  \n- **Strategic Alignment**:  \n  - Wheat is my least valuable surplus (18 units\u219214 after trade), while Ore is most valuable (7\u21928).  \n  - Player 0 previously gave *more* (6 Wheat + Wood) for 1 Ore\u2014this offer appears \"generous\" to them, increasing acceptance odds.  \n  - Minimal risk: If rejected, Wheat remains easy to offload later.  \n\n*Alternatives considered but rejected*:  \n- Sheep-for-Ore (e.g., 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore): Net gain +4, but Sheep has medium utility (better saved for future high-gain Brick trades).  \n- Wheat-for-Brick (e.g., 3 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick): Net gain +7, but Ore has higher priority.  \n\n**Next Steps**:  \n- If Player 0 counters, reassess based on their proposal\u2019s value delta.  \n- Future turns will focus on liquidating Sheep for Brick (target rate: \u22643 Sheep per Brick).  \n\n---  \nThis offer advances my core objective: **convert low-impact resources into high-value assets** while exploiting Player 0\u2019s valuation gaps.",

      "response": "## Step 1: Assess the current situation and resources.\nThe resources and associated values I currently have are:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 24   Value: 6\n- [Wood]    Qty: 7    Value: 11\n- [Sheep]   Qty: 9    Value: 15\n- [Brick]   Qty: 5    Value: 22\n- [Ore]     Qty: 16   Value: 35\n\nAfter the last trade, the quantities have changed. Initially, I had 24 Wheat and 16 Ore. I traded 6 Wheat and 1 Wood for 1 Ore. So, the new quantities are:\n- [Wheat]   Qty: 24 - 6 = 18\n- [Wood]    Qty: 7 - 1 = 6\n- [Ore]     Qty: 16 + 1 = 17\n\n## Step 2: Generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation.\nKey principles and strategies for resource trading and negotiation include:\n1. **Value-based trading**: Trade resources of lower value for those of higher value to increase total resource value.\n2. **Assessing resource surplus and scarcity**: Identify which resources you have in abundance and which are scarce to make informed trading decisions.\n3. **Understanding the opponent's needs**: Try to deduce what the other player needs or values highly to make a mutually beneficial trade.\n4. **Negotiation tactics**: Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your offer based on the other player's response.\n5. **Resource valuation**: Compare the values of the resources being traded to ensure the trade is beneficial.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the generated knowledge to the current situation.\nGiven the current resources and their values:\n- The total initial value is (24*6) + (7*11) + (9*15) + (5*22) + (16*35) = 144 + 77 + 135 + 110 + 560 = 1026.\n- After the last trade, I have 18 Wheat, 6 Wood, 9 Sheep, 5 Brick, and 17 Ore.\n- The new total value is (18*6) + (6*11) + (9*15) + (5*22) + (17*35) = 108 + 66 + 135 + 110 + 595 = 1014.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the new offer from Player 1.\nPlayer 1 made an offer: Offered items: 4 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Ore.\n- I currently have 18 Wheat and 17 Ore.\n- If I accept, I will have 18 + 4 = 22 Wheat and 17 - 1 = 16 Ore.\n- The change in value is (4*6) - (1*35) = 24 - 35 = -11.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on the offer from Player 1.\nSince the trade results in a negative change in value (-11), it is not beneficial to accept the offer as it decreases my total resource value.\n\n## Step 6: Formulate a new trading decision based on the current situation and knowledge.\nTo increase the total value of my resources, I should look for opportunities to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Currently, Wheat (Value: 6) is the lowest value resource I have in significant quantity, and Ore (Value: 35) is one of the highest.\n\n## Step 7: Propose a new trade offer.\nConsidering the values, trading Wheat for Ore or Brick (Value: 22) could be beneficial. I already have a significant amount of Ore, so trading Wheat for Brick might be more beneficial as it doesn't overly increase my Ore quantity.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate a potential trade.\nOffering Wheat for Brick: I have 18 Wheat, so offering a portion of it for Brick could be beneficial. For example, '[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]' would be a potential trade, as it trades a resource of value 6*4 = 24 for one of value 22, which is not beneficial. However, adjusting the quantity or considering other resources is necessary.\n\n## Step 9: Consider an alternative trade involving other resources.\nAnother option is to trade resources like Wood (Value: 11) or Sheep (Value: 15) for Ore or Brick. For instance, '[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]' gives a value change of 22 - 15 = 7, which is positive.\n\n## Step 10: Make a trading decision.\nLet's propose '[Offer: 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]' to Player 1. This trade involves giving up resources worth (1*15) + (2*6) = 15 + 12 = 27 and gaining a resource worth 22, which is not beneficial.\n\n## Step 11: Refine the trading decision.\nA simpler trade could be '[Offer: 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]'. The value change here is 22 (for Brick) - 11 (for Wood) = 11, which is positive and thus beneficial.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]}$",

      "response": "To tackle this task, let's first understand the current situation and then generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- You are Player 0.\n- Resources and their values you currently have:\n  - Wheat: 24 units, Value: 6\n  - Wood: 7 units, Value: 11\n  - Sheep: 9 units, Value: 15\n  - Brick: 5 units, Value: 22\n  - Ore: 16 units, Value: 35\n- The game is on the 8th turn (since the last turn is the 10th turn and you've made several offers and rejections).\n\n### Previous Transactions and Outcomes:\n1. You offered 5 Wheat for 1 Ore to Player 1, which was rejected.\n2. You offered 6 Wheat and 1 Wood for 2 Brick to Player 1, which was rejected.\n3. Player 1 offered 3 Sheep for 1 Brick, which you rejected.\n4. You offered 6 Wheat and 1 Wood for 1 Ore to Player 1, which was accepted. \n   - After this transaction, your resources will be: \n     - Wheat: 18 units\n     - Wood: 6 units\n     - Sheep: 9 units\n     - Brick: 5 units\n     - Ore: 17 units\n5. Player 1 offered 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, which you rejected.\n6. You offered 4 Wheat for 1 Brick, which was rejected.\n\n### Generating Knowledge:\n1. **Value of Resources**: Understand the value of each resource. Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n2. **Current Holdings**: Assess your current holdings and their total value. Initially, your total value is (24*6) + (7*11) + (9*15) + (5*22) + (16*35) = 144 + 77 + 135 + 110 + 560 = 1026. After the last accepted trade, it will be (18*6) + (6*11) + (9*15) + (5*22) + (17*35) = 108 + 66 + 135 + 110 + 595 = 1014. Your total value has decreased slightly.\n3. **Trading Strategy**: To increase the total value of your resources, you should aim to acquire resources of higher value or maintain the current value while getting rid of lower-value resources.\n4. **Observation of Player 1's Behavior**: Player 1 is willing to trade resources and has accepted one of your offers (6 Wheat and 1 Wood for 1 Ore). They seem to value Ore and were willing to give it up for a significant amount of Wheat and some Wood.\n5. **Negotiation Tactics**: Given that Player 1 accepted a trade involving Wheat and Wood for Ore, it indicates they might be in need of Wheat or Wood. You should leverage this information for future trades.\n\n### Applying the Knowledge to Make a Trading Decision:\nGiven the current situation and the knowledge generated:\n\n1. **Assess Your Resources Again**: After the last transaction, you have 18 Wheat, 6 Wood, 9 Sheep, 5 Brick, and 17 Ore.\n2. **Identify Potential Trades**: Since Ore is valuable and you have it, consider trades that get you more valuable resources or improve your position.\n3. **Consider Player 1's Last Offer**: Player 1 offered 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, which you rejected. Given your current holdings, offering something similar or slightly better might work if you're looking to get rid of Wheat.\n\nLet's think about making a new offer:\n- You could offer some Wheat (since it's less valuable and you have a decent amount) and possibly some other less valuable resources for something more valuable or at least equally valuable.\n\nConsidering your resources and the previous interactions:\n- **[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]**: This is a potential offer. You're giving away resources worth (5*6) + (1*11) = 30 + 11 = 41 for 1 Brick worth 22. This is not a good trade for you as it decreases your total value.\n- **[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]**: You're offering resources worth (3*6) = 18 for 1 Sheep worth 15. Again, not beneficial.\n- **[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]**: Offering (2*6) = 12 for 1 Brick worth 22. This could be a good trade, but let's check if it's reasonable based on previous rejections.\n\nLet's make a reasonable offer:\n- **[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]**: However, you just got 1 Ore for 6 Wheat and 1 Wood. Making a similar offer might not be accepted.\n- **[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**: This involves giving away (2*6) + (1*15) = 12 + 15 = 27 for 1 Ore worth 35. It's a potential offer because you're gaining value.\n\n### Decision:\nLet's make a new offer that could be beneficial:\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis is the action for this turn. \n\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]'",

Accept offers if:\n   - Gained resource value > Lost resource value.\n   - Counteroffers must be aggressively favorable to avoid rejection.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Current Offer:\n- **Player 0's Offer**:  \n  - Offers `5 Wheat (Value: 6 \u00d7 5 = 30) + 1 Wood (Value: 12) = Total Offered: 42`  \n  - Requests `1 Brick (Value: 25)`  \n  - **Net Value Gain**: `42 \u2212 25 = +17` (profitable).  \n- **Inventory Impact**: Accepting reduces Brick (10 \u2192 9) but increases low-value Wheat (18 \u2192 23) and Wood (8 \u2192 9). Total value rises from 927 to 944.  \n- **Risk Assessment**:  \n  - Counteroffers (e.g., Sheep-for-Brick) were rejected historically. At Turn 10, proposing new trades risks losing the guaranteed +17 gain.  \n  - Player 0\u2019s consistent Brick demand suggests accepting exploits their valuation mismatch.  \n\n### Decision:\nAccept this advantageous offer. The net gain of +17 aligns with value maximization, uses the last turn effectively, and leverages Player 0\u2019s persistent overvaluation of Brick.  \n\n[Accept]",

      "response": "To improve my resource value, I need to analyze my current resources and the trades made so far.\n\n### Current Resources:\n- Wheat: 24 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 7 (Value: 11)\n- Sheep: 9 (Value: 15)\n- Brick: 5 (Value: 22)\n- Ore: 16 (Value: 35)\n\n### Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: The goal is to maximize the total value of resources. Currently, my total value is (24*6) + (7*11) + (9*15) + (5*22) + (16*35) = 144 + 77 + 135 + 110 + 560 = 1026.\n\n2. **Resource Valuation**: Resources with higher individual values are more valuable. Ore (Value: 35) is the most valuable resource, followed by Brick (Value: 22), Sheep (Value: 15), Wood (Value: 11), and Wheat (Value: 6).\n\n3. **Trading Strategy**: To increase the total value, I should try to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones or maintain the quantity of high-value resources while acquiring more if possible.\n\n4. **Past Trades Analysis**:\n   - Initially offered 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, rejected.\n   - Then offered 6 Wheat, 1 Wood for 2 Brick, rejected.\n   - Player 1 offered 3 Sheep for 1 Brick, rejected by me.\n   - Successfully traded 6 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Ore.\n   - Later, offered 4 Wheat for 1 Brick, rejected.\n   - Successfully traded 5 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Brick.\n\n5. **Current Status After Last Trade**:\n   - Wheat: 24 - 6 - 5 = 13\n   - Wood: 7 - 1 - 1 = 5\n   - Sheep: 9\n   - Brick: 5 + 1 = 6\n   - Ore: 16 + 1 = 17\n\nNew total value = (13*6) + (5*11) + (9*15) + (6*22) + (17*35) = 78 + 55 + 135 + 132 + 595 = 995.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The last successful trades (6 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Ore and 5 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Brick) slightly decreased my total value from 1026 to 995. This indicates that the trades, while acquiring more resources, didn't necessarily increase the total value due to the difference in resource values.\n\n2. I have been trying to get Ore and Brick, which are high-value resources, by offering Wheat and Wood.\n\n### Decision Making:\nTo increase the total value, I should look for opportunities to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones. Given my current resources and the history of trades, here are a few strategies:\n\n1. **Offer Wheat and/or Wood for Ore or Brick**: Continue trying to get more Ore or Brick as they are high-value resources.\n\n2. **Avoid Losing High-Value Resources**: Be cautious in offering Sheep, Brick, or Ore as they are of higher value.\n\n### Action:\nLet's make an offer that aligns with our strategy. I will offer some Wheat for Brick or Ore.\n\n**Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore**\n\nUsing the special token format: `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds.\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`",
