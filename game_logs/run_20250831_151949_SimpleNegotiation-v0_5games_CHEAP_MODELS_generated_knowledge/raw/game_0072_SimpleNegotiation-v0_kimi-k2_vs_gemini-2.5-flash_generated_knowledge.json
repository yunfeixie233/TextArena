      "response": "Knowledge:\n\n1. Value Density Drives Advantage  \n   - A trade only increases my total value if the per-unit value I give away is lower than the per-unit value I receive.  \n   - Per-unit values: Wheat 6, Wood 8, Sheep 14, Brick 20, Ore 34.  \n   \u21d2 Anything valued \u226520 is \u201cpremium,\u201d anything \u22648 is \u201ccheap.\u201d  \n   Consequently, no per-unit value is gained by trading away any Brick or Ore; those are the top two.  \n   The negotiable space therefore centers on low-value Wheat/Wood and medium-value Sheep.\n\n2. Scarcity & Substitutability  \n   - Wood and Wheat are widespread (17 and 14 units); they are prime give-aways if another player needs volume.  \n   - Sheep and Brick constitute only 18 % of my total holdings (12 units), so larger trades involving Sheep start to push scarcity, risking loss of production capacity.\n\n3. Concentration vs Diversification  \n   Four Brick and six Ore already sit at the top of my value list; any further shift into them magnifies a single-point-of-failure into one resource. I should not seek massive over-accumulation in any single premium resource but instead prefer lightweight, value-positive, \u201cdown-trades\u201d where I trade small # of cheap units for medium Brick/Ore.\n\n4. Framing the Offer  \n   - Plausible narrative: \u201cI have an abundance of Wheat and Wood (cheap logistics) and can ship in extra grain or timber in return for more durable block or ferry metals.\u201d  \n   - Anchoring the perceived fairness ratio. Historical fairness in Settlers-styled economies uses roughly 2-for-1 or 3-for-1 of cheap for premium; therefore I should phrase my ask as \u201c3 cheap for 2 premium\u201d or \u201c3 cheap + 1 cheap for 3 premium.\u201d\n\n5. Turn Timing  \n   Turn 1 of 10; any offer that grows total value now compounds over the remaining nine turns. Therefore early incremental gains via low-risk sets of Wheat/Wood trades are preferable to attempts at huge block trades that might be denied.\n\nTarget Trade Design  \nCurrent holdings: 14 Wheat (6ea), 17 Wood (8ea) \u2013 tons of discardable volume.  \nI\u2019d happily trade off 3 Wood and 1 Wheat in exchange for 2 Brick.  \nThat is 3\u00b78 + 1\u00b76 = 30 value out, 2\u00b720 = 40 value in \u2192 +10 net.\n\nNegotiation Strategy  \nLead with the food & lumber narrative: \u201cHappy to offer fresh Wheat and Wood for stronger infrastructural materials like Brick.\u201d\n\nDecision: make the above proposal to Player 1 now so the seed is planted, but be ready to adjust volume if countered (e.g., 2 Wood + 1 Wheat\u21922 Brick).\n\n[Offer: 1 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n*   **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This is the primary goal. Every trade should be evaluated against this.\n*   **Total Value Calculation:** To evaluate offers, I need to be able to quickly calculate the value of resources offered and requested. Current values: Wheat=5, Wood=12, Sheep=17, Brick=29, Ore=39.\n*   **Offer Analysis:** Player 0's offer is 1 Wheat (Value: 5) + 3 Wood (Value: 3 * 12 = 36) = Total offered value: 41. They are requesting 2 Brick (Value: 2 * 29 = 58).\n*   **Value Discrepancy:** Accepting this offer means giving up 58 value to gain 41 value. This is a negative value trade for me (58 - 41 = 17 value loss).\n*   **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:** I have a decent quantity of Sheep (24) and Brick (18), and Wheat (5) is my lowest quantity. While quantity isn't directly related to value in the problem statement (value is per unit), it's good to keep in mind for future offers if I want to diversify or consolidate.\n*   **Negotiation Strategy:** Since my objective is to increase value, I should *never* accept an offer that results in a net loss of value. I should also aim for trades where I gain more value than I give up. If an offer is bad, I should deny it and potentially counter-offer.\n*   **Counter-Offering:** While not explicitly asked for in this turn\u2019s action, considering potential counter-offers is part of a strong negotiation strategy.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. Marginal value thinking \u2013 Every turn you should be willing to give up the lowest-value-per-unit resources for the highest-value-per-unit resources, as long as it raises your *total* score.  \n   - My valuation per unit: Wheat = 6, Wood = 8, Sheep = 14, Brick = 20, Ore = 34.  \n   - Therefore anything Sheep, Brick, Ore is worth obtaining; any Wheat or Wood is worth giving away.\n\n2. Supply imbalance \u2013 My Brick stock (7) already weighs in at the highest absolute value contained in a single good (7 \u00d7 20 = 140). Additional Brick yields *more* points for me than any other unit I lack, but only if I can get them at favorable rates since each Brick is worth 20.  \n\n3. Resource flexibility & package deals \u2013 Because I am *long* Wheat (14) and Wood (17), I prefer to bundle them in offers so that even modest Brick gains raise marginal value. My opponent has already declined a 1 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick offer, trading only 6+24=30 for 40\u2014already a bad deal for them. So pushing supplies too high isn\u2019t working.\n\n4. Sheep scarcity on my side \u2013 With only 5 Sheep valued at 14 each, Sheep is *not* the good I want to give away; however, it could serve as sweetener in an otherwise low-value bundle if I can still end up with *more* total points.\n\n5. Ore payoff \u2013 My single highest value good (34 each). Giving Ore away is only worthwhile if the *gains* per unit surrendered significantly outvalue 34 (certainly true for Brick at 20 \u00d7 X if X\u22652, but still borderline; only for multiple Brick can it look attractive).\n\nDecision problem this turn:\nSince my prior Wheat+Wood \u2192 Brick offer was rejected, I need either (a) sweeten the deal while still profiting, or (b) pivot my ask.  \nBecause I\u2019d still like more Brick, and Ore gives the strongest buy-sell differential, a small Ore ask for Brick amplification makes sense:  \n- Giving 3 Sheep (low % of total Sheep value) + 2 Ore (high value, but only ~3% of total points saved in Ore) and requesting back 5 Brick + 2 Sheep to *net*: lose 3+2=5 units, get back 5 Brick (\u219120 each) + keep the returned Sheep to total 2 more Sheep than started. Net score impact: \u22123\u00d714 \u22122\u00d734 +5\u00d720 = \u221242 \u221268 +100 = \u221210. That is in fact **negative**\u2014not in my favor. Remove the returned-Sheep sweetener and recalculate.  \n\nBetter direct offer: give 2 Ore (2 \u00d7 34 = 68) and get 4 Brick (4 \u00d7 20 = 80). Score delta = +12.  \nEncodable compactly as:\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 4 Brick]\n\nAlternative using more food/wood which I already overstock: 3 Wood, 1 Wheat \u2192 2 Brick yields 3\u00d78 + 6 = 30 offered for 40 returned (+10 gain). That is close to my first but still improving and avoids Ore. Since my prior 1 Wheat+3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick was refused, it\u2019s likely Player 1 doesn\u2019t want to part with Brick that cheaply.  \n\nHence strongest expected improvement without sweetening too many high-value units: stick with Ore for Brick at 2:4, or stay put.\n\nAction:\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 4 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. Marginal Value Principle  \n   - Each extra unit of a resource has diminishing marginal value to you, but may have increasing marginal value to an opponent who is short on it.  \n   - Your Brick (value 20) and Ore (value 34) are the scarcest and highest-valued resources. You should try to acquire more of them, not give them away.\n\n2. Surplus & Scarcity Matching  \n   - Your Wheat (14 qty) and Wood (17 qty) are plentiful and low-value to you (6 & 8). These are ideal \u201cgive-away\u201d goods.  \n   - You have only 7 Brick and 6 Ore, so you are short on both. You want to turn surplus Wheat/Wood into Brick/Ore.\n\n3. Transaction Sweet-Spot  \n   - A trade should improve both parties\u2019 total value.  \n   - Because you already have a lot of Wheat and Wood, giving up a few more units costs you little marginal value, while acquiring even 1-2 extra Brick or Ore yields high marginal gain.\n\n4. Rejection Signals  \n   - Two prior offers to Player 1 (1 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 2 Brick and 2 Ore \u2192 4 Brick) were rejected.  \n   - Player 1 apparently places a higher value on Brick than those offers implied, or does not need Wheat/Wood/Ore at those rates.  \n   - Therefore, you must either (a) offer more attractive quantities of your low-value surplus, or (b) request a smaller amount of Brick/Ore.\n\n5. Reputation & Turn Economy  \n   - Only 10 turns total; you have already used 3. You can\u2019t afford to keep making offers that are certain to be rejected.  \n   - Make one more moderate, high-probability offer instead of many incremental ones.\n\nApplying Knowledge:\n- You still have 14 Wheat and 17 Wood\u2014both low-value.  \n- You still need Brick/Ore.  \n- A revised offer should give away more of the surplus (to make it attractive) while asking for a modest amount of Brick/Ore (to raise acceptance odds).\n\nBest single move: Offer 4 Wheat + 3 Wood for 3 Brick.  \n- You give away 4 of your lowest-valued resource and 3 of your second-lowest, which together cost you only 4\u00d76 + 3\u00d78 = 48 value.  \n- You gain 3 high-valued Brick worth 3\u00d720 = 60 value, a net gain of 12 for you.  \n- For Player 1, this is only attractive if they value 4 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2265 3 Brick; we can\u2019t be sure, but the larger surplus may tip the balance.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 3 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trades I make should result in a net gain in value. I need to calculate the value of both sides of a proposed trade.\n2.  **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:** Identify which resources I have in large quantities and which I have in low quantities. Resources I have in abundance are more expendable for trades, especially if they have a low per-unit value. Scarce resources, especially high-value ones, should be protected (or acquired strategically).\n    *   My current high-value resources: Ore (39), Brick (29), Sheep (17), Wood (12), Wheat (5). No, these are per-unit values.\n    *   Let's calculate total value per resource:\n        *   Wheat: 5 * 5 = 25\n        *   Wood: 7 * 12 = 84\n        *   Sheep: 24 * 17 = 408\n        *   Brick: 18 * 29 = 522\n        *   Ore: 11 * 39 = 429\n    *   My most abundant resources are Sheep (24), Brick (18), Ore (11).\n    *   My least abundant are Wheat (5) and Wood (7).\n3.  **Per-Unit Value Analysis:** Understand the individual value of each resource. This helps in determining fair exchange rates and identifying opportunities for profit. Trading low-value items for high-value items is generally good.\n    *   Ore (39/unit) is my most valuable per unit.\n    *   Brick (29/unit) is second.\n    *   Sheep (17/unit) is third.\n    *   Wood (12/unit) is fourth.\n    *   Wheat (5/unit) is least valuable per unit.\n4.  **Opponent's Probable Needs/Offers:** While I don't know the opponent's inventory, their repeated offers for Brick suggest they value it or need it. They have consistently offered lower-value items (Wheat, Wood, Ore in one case) for Brick. This indicates Brick might be more valuable to them than it is to me, or they have a surplus of the items they are offering.\n5.  **Strategic Denial/Counter-Offer:** Don't accept offers that result in a net loss or only a tiny gain if better opportunities might exist. Use denial as a way to signal dissatisfaction and push for better terms. Follow up denials with counter-offers that are slightly more favorable to me but still palatable to the opponent.\n6.  **Incremental Gains:** It's okay to make trades for small gains, especially if they move towards a long-term goal (e.g., getting rid of low-value, high-quantity resources to acquire high-value ones).\n7.  **Trading \"Up\":** Aim to trade resources with lower per-unit value or those I have in abundance for resources with higher per-unit value, especially those I have less of.\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> Requested items: 3 Brick\n\nLet's evaluate Player 0's offer:\n*   Items offered:\n    *   4 Wheat: 4 * 5 = 20\n    *   3 Wood: 3 * 12 = 36\n    *   Total offered value: 20 + 36 = 56\n*   Items requested:\n    *   3 Brick: 3 * 29 = 87\n\nIf I accept this trade, I lose 87 value and gain 56 value, resulting in a net loss of 31 value. This directly violates my primary goal of value maximization.\n\nGiven the opponent's previous offers for Brick, and this attempt to get 3 Brick for items far less valuable, they are clearly trying to get a good deal for themselves. I need to counter with something that benefits me. I have a good amount of Brick and Ore, both high-value. I don't want to give away too much of my high-value items (Brick, Ore, Sheep) for low-value items unless the ratio is extremely in my favor.\n\nMy least valuable per unit is Wheat (5) and Wood (12). I have some quantity of both. I have a lot of Sheep (24) which is mid-range value.\n\nI will formulate a counter-offer that aims to get high-value resources while giving away lower-value ones, or at least breaking even. Player 0 seems keen on getting Brick.\nInstead of giving up Brick, I could try to get some, or offer my most abundant high-value resource (Sheep) for something more valuable like Ore or even more Brick.\n\nLet's consider what I want to achieve with a counter-offer:\n1.  Increase my total value.\n2.  Maintain or increase my quantity of high-value resources (Brick, Ore).\n3.  Potentially offload some lower-value or high-quantity resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep).\n\nPlayer 0's current offer asks for too much Brick. I will not give 3 Brick for that low value. I should try to get more value for my Brick, or trade different items.\n\nHow about I try to get their high-value resources for some of my many sheep, or my abundant Brick? Or, if I must give Brick, I need significantly more in return.\n\nLet's try to slightly adjust their offer to make it less negative for me, or turn it positive.\nIf I offer 2 Brick (58 value) for their 4 Wheat (20) & 3 Wood (36) = 56 value, it's still a loss. So no.\n\nWhat if I offer something I have a LOT of, like Sheep?\nSay, I offer 5 Sheep (5 * 17 = 85) for something valuable?\nPlayer 0 is short on Brick. Maybe they have Ore or Wood/Wheat to spare.\n\nI'll try an offer where I move some quantity of Sheep for a higher-value item.\nLet's see the per-unit values again: Ore (39), Brick (29), Sheep (17), Wood (12), Wheat (5).\n\nI want to turn this into a trade that benefits me. Player 0 has consistently asked for Brick. I have 18 Brick. I can spare some if the return is good.\n\nInstead of accepting their loss-making offer, I will propose a trade designed to increase my value.\nI want to get Ore (39) or Brick (29). I can offer Sheep (17), Wood (12), or Wheat (5).\n\nOption 1: Give low value, get high value.\nSay, I offer Wood and Sheep for Ore.\nOffer: 3 Sheep (51) + 2 Wood (24) = 75 value.\nRequest: 2 Ore (78 value). This is a net gain of 3. It's close to 1:1 in terms of higher value items.\n\nOption 2: Counter their Brick request with a better value for me.\nIf they want Brick so badly, I'll give them Brick, but at a premium for me.\nThey offered 4 Wheat (20) + 3 Wood (36) = 56 for 3 Brick (87).\nI could offer them 2 Brick (58 value) for something of higher value from them. They are offering low value items.\nI need to ask for *more* than 58 value in return for 2 Brick.\nWhat if I give them 2 Brick (58) for something they have, say, a mix of Ore and Wood/Wheat?\nSay, 1 Ore (39) + 2 Wood (24) = 63. This is a +5 for me.\n\nLet's try to improve on the last offer they *rejected*: \"Player 1 made no new trade offer.\" My last action was a denial. I need to *make* an offer.\n\nMy goal is to increase my resource value. I have plenty of Sheep. Player 0 needs Brick.\nI could try a simple trade: trade abundant relatively low-value Sheep for higher-value Ore or Brick.\n\nOffer: 4 Sheep (4 * 17 = 68)\nRequest: 2 Ore (2 * 39 = 78) --> Net gain of 10. This seems reasonable. It's a 2:1 ratio for Sheep to Ore, which might be acceptable.\nOr, 2 Brick (2 * 29 = 58)? No, that's a loss for me.\n\nConsider the explicit offer from Player 0 (4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 3 Brick). I *must* respond to this specific offer. I denied it implicitly in the last round by not accepting, but now it's laid out again.\n\nThe prompt states: \"Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> Requested items: 3 Brick\". I need to respond to this.\n\nI will deny this and then make a counter offer.\n\nValue of Player 0's offer: 4 Wheat (20) + 3 Wood (36) = 56. Value requested by P0: 3 Brick (87). This is a net loss of 31 for me. I *must* deny this.\n\nNow, what is my best counter-offer?\nPlayer 0 wants Brick. I have Brick. I want to increase my value.\nI have a lot of Sheep (24) which is 17 value per unit.\nI have Wheat (5) and Wood (12) but less quantity (5 and 7).\n\nLet's try to trade Sheep for Ore or Brick.\nOffer: 5 Sheep (85 value)\nRequest: 2 Ore (78 value). This is a net loss of 7 value. Not good.\nRequest: 3 Brick (87 value). This is a net gain of 2 value for me. This is minimal, but positive.\n\nHow about I offer Brick, but for a good premium?\nI have 18 Brick.\nOffer: 2 Brick (58 value)\nRequest: 2 Ore (78 value). This is a +20 gain for me! This is excellent. Is it too aggressive?\nOr, 1 Ore (39) and 1 Brick (29) = 68. This is a +10 for me, offering 2 Brick, getting 1 Ore + 1 Brick back. So I give 2 Brick, get 1 Ore and 1 Brick. Net change is giving 1 Brick for 1 Ore. (Value difference 29 vs 39 = +10). This seems very good for me.\n\nThis is a competitive game. I should aim for a significant gain if possible, while still making it plausible for the opponent to accept.\nPlayer 0 wants Brick. I can give them Brick if I get something considerably better back.\n\nMy proposed offer: Giving 2 Brick (58 value) for 1 Ore (39) and 1 Brick (29) = 68 value.\nThis is a net gain of 10. I give 2 Brick, receive 1 Ore and 1 Brick. This means I'm effectively trading 1 Brick (29 value) for 1 Ore (39 value). This benefits me.\n\nDecision: Deny the current offer due to significant value loss. Propose a counter-offer that gains me value, by trading a unit of Brick for a unit of Ore, also satisfying Player 0's apparent need for Brick.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",

This means any trade must result in a net positive value gain for me. I need to calculate the value of both what I give and what I receive for every potential trade.\n2.  **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:** I have large quantities of Sheep (24), Brick (18), and Ore (11), and smaller quantities of Wheat (5) and Wood (7). This means I might be more willing to trade away Sheep, Brick, or Ore if the value proposition is good, and more hesitant to trade Wheat or Wood unless the gain is substantial.\n3.  **Player's Needs (Inferred):** Player 0 has consistently requested Brick. This suggests Brick is valuable to them or they are in short supply. They also offered Wheat, Wood, and Ore in previous turns. This indicates they likely have an abundance of these or value them less than Brick.\n4.  **Negotiation History:** Player 0 has consistently rejected my offers and I've rejected theirs. My previous offer of \"2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick\" was a net loss for me (58 value given for 29+39=68 received, but I was trading 2 Brick for 1 Ore and effectively taking 1 Brick back, which is just 1 Ore for 1 Brick). This was poor for them. My previous offers of no new trade also did not help. Player 0 has incrementally increased their offers. The current offer is \"3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick\".\n5.  **Calculate Current Offer Value:**\n    *   Player 0's offer: Give 3 Wheat (3 * 5 = 15) + 2 Wood (2 * 12 = 24) = 39 value.\n    *   Player 0's request: Receive 2 Brick (2 * 29 = 58 value).\n    *   For me, accepting this offer means: I *give* 58 value, and *receive* 39 value. This is a net loss of 19 value. This is a bad trade for me.\n6.  **Strategic Counter-Offer:** Since Player 0 consistently wants Brick, I should leverage that. I need to ask for more value for my Brick, or give less Brick for the same items. I have ample Brick, so trading some is acceptable if the value is right. Player 0 seems to have Wheat and Wood.\n\nApplying Knowledge and Making Decision:\n\nThe current offer from Player 0 (3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 2 Brick) is a bad deal for me as it results in a net loss of value. I need to counter-offer with something that increases my total resource value. Player 0 consistently wants Brick. I need to make an offer where I give Brick, but gain more value than I give.\n\nLet's look at the resources I have and their values:\n*   Wheat: 5\n*   Wood: 12\n*   Sheep: 17\n*   Brick: 29\n*   Ore: 39\n\nPlayer 0 has offered Wheat and Wood. Their value is relatively low. Brick and Ore are my highest value resources. My previous counter-offer was poor. I need to be smarter.\n\nSince Player 0 is offering 3 Wheat (15) and 2 Wood (24) = 39 value, for 2 Brick (58 value), they are asking for a lot of value for relatively low value resources.\n\nI am willing to part with Brick. What if I offer less Brick for more value?\nLet's aim for a positive value gain.\nIf I give 1 Brick (29 value), what can I ask for?\nI want something worth more than 29.\nIf I ask for 2 Ore (2 * 39 = 78), that's too much.\nIf I ask for 1 Ore (39 value), that would be a gain of 10 value for me (39-29). This is a good trade.\nPlayer 0 has previously offered Ore. This is a possibility.\n\nLet's consider items Player 0 has consistently offered (Wheat, Wood).\nIf I give 1 Brick (29 value), and ask for:\n*   2 Ore (78) - too high.\n*   1 Ore (39) - good for me (+10 value).\n*   4 Wheat (20) + 1 Wood (12) = 32. This is a +3 gain for me. Potentially acceptable.\n*   3 Wood (36). This is a +7 gain for me. Good.\n\nPlayer 0 seems desperate for Brick. I should aim for a significant gain.\nThe offer of \"1 Brick -> 1 Ore\" is very favorable to me and still gives Player 0 a high-value resource they seem to want (Brick).\nMy stock of Ore is only 11. My stock of Brick is 18. So trading 1 Brick for 1 Ore still keeps my very high-value Ore relatively high, while reducing my abundant high-value Brick.\n\nI will counter with an offer that ensures I gain value and addresses Player 0's consistent need for Brick, while asking for one of the higher-value resources.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "**Generate Knowledge:**\n\n1.  **Value-Based Trading:** The primary objective is to increase the total value of my resources. Every trade should be evaluated based on whether the value of the requested items significantly exceeds the value of the offered items. I need to calculate the current value of each resource I possess.\n2.  **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:** I have an abundance of Sheep (24) and Brick (18), and a good amount of Ore (11). Wheat (5) and Wood (7) are relatively scarcer for me. This means I should be more willing to trade away Sheep or Brick, and less willing to trade away Wheat or Wood unless the value proposition is extremely good.\n3.  **Opponent's Needs (Inferred):** Player 0 has repeatedly offered Wheat and Wood for Brick. This strongly suggests that Player 0 needs Brick. This is a powerful leverage point. They have offered 3 Wheat, 2 Wood (value: 5\\*3 + 7\\*2 = 15 + 14 = 29) for 3 Brick (value: 29\\*3 = 87). This indicates a high demand for Brick on their end.\n4.  **Identifying Good Trades (My Perspective):**\n    *   Trading away lower-value items for higher-value items.\n    *   Trading items I have in abundance for items I lack or items that have a higher value.\n    *   Offering small amounts of high-value items if the return is even higher, or if it helps me acquire specific resources for future, more valuable combinations (though not explicitly stated in this game, it's a general negotiation principle).\n5.  **Perceived Value vs. Actual Value:** While my internal valuation is fixed, the opponent's valuation might differ. Their repeated attempts for Brick at seemingly unfavorable ratios (for them) suggest their perceived value of Brick is very high. I should capitalize on this.\n6.  **Negotiation Strategy:**\n    *   **Be Patient:** Don't accept bad offers just to make a trade. I have time (10 turns, currently unclear which turn it is, but past offers show persistence).\n    *   **Counter-Offer Smartly:** My previous counter-offers were perhaps too aggressive (2 Brick for 1 Ore, 1 Brick, or 1 Brick for 1 Ore). Player 0 denied them. I need to find a sweet spot that benefits me significantly but is still palatable for them given their strong need for Brick.\n    *   **Leverage Demand:** Player 0 clearly wants Brick. I should aim to get high-value items in return for my Brick. Ore (value 39) is the highest value item. Wheat/Wood are low value.\n    *   **Avoid Giving Up Value Unnecessarily:** Don't give up my most valuable resource (Ore) cheaply, or my scarcer resources (Wheat, Wood) unless the trade is exceptionally good.\n\n**Resource Valuation:**\n*   Wheat: 5 per unit\n*   Wood: 12 per unit\n*   Sheep: 17 per unit\n*   Brick: 29 per unit\n*   Ore: 39 per unit\n\n**Player 0's latest offer analysis:**\n*   Offered: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood\n    *   Value = (3 * 5) + (2 * 12) = 15 + 24 = 39\n*   Requested: 3 Brick\n    *   Value = 3 * 29 = 87\n\nThis is a very favorable offer for me to *receive* 3 Brick, but they are *asking* for 3 Brick. This means Player 0 is *offering* 3 Wheat, 2 Wood **for** 3 Brick. So I would *lose* 3 Brick (Value 87) and *gain* 3 Wheat, 2 Wood (Value 39). This is a terrible trade for me. I need to reverse this and demand their high-value resources for *my* Brick.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nPlayer 0 wants Brick. I have Brick. I should offer Brick to them, but demand higher value in return. They offered 3 Wheat, 2 Wood (value 39) for 3 Brick (value 87). This shows they desperately need Brick. I will offer a smaller amount of Brick for a higher value resource, specifically Ore, which is my highest value resource.\n\nI need to make an offer that nets me a significant value increase.\nMy previous offers (2 Brick for 1 Ore, 1 Brick; 1 Brick for 1 Ore) were perhaps *too* greedy or didn't align with what they could offer.\nLet's re-evaluate. I want to convert my abundant Brick into Ore.\nIf I offer 1 Brick (value 29), I'd want something of higher value. E.g., 1 Ore (value 39). This is a net gain of +10 value. It's a standard gain for me.\nThe previous demand from Player 0 (3 Wheat, 2 Wood for 3 Brick) means they value 3 Brick at least as much as 3 Wheat + 2 Wood.\n\nLet's try a small strategic offer. I have plenty of Brick. I want Ore.\nOffer: 1 Brick (value 29)\nRequest: 1 Ore (value 39). This is a +10 value gain for me. Is it reasonable for them? They are getting a Brick they want for an Ore (which they might have in excess, or are willing to part with for Brick).\nThey previously offered 3 Wheat, 2 Wood (value 39) for 3 Brick (value 87). This means they are willing to give up a value of 39 for a value of 87. My proposed trade of 1 Brick for 1 Ore is a value trade of 29 for 39; this means they would give up 39 value (Ore) to get 29 value (Brick). This might not be appealing to them based on a pure value perspective.\n\nHowever, if their *need* for Brick is paramount, they might accept a slight *loss* in immediate value to get the resource they desperately need. Given their previous offers, they seem willing to overpay for Brick.\nThe previous offer was 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick. They offered a total value of 39 to gain 3 Brick.\nI want to offer 1 Brick for something. How much Wheat/Wood would be fair for 1 Brick?\n1 Brick (value 29). I want to gain more than 29 value.\nPerhaps I can target their abundance (Wheat/Wood) but at a better ratio for me. They offered 3 Wheat, 2 Wood (total value 39) for 3 Brick. So each Brick would cost them 13 value (39/3). I want to sell my Brick for more than 29 value.\n\nIt seems I misunderstood the last offer. Player 0 made the following offer to Player 1: Offered items: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> Requested items: 3 Brick.\n\nThis means Player 0 is giving up 3 Wheat, 2 Wood (value 39) to get 3 Brick (value 87). This would be an *amazing* trade for me if I were *receiving* the Brick. But I am *giving* the Brick. This offer from Player 0 is terrible for me. I would lose 87 value and gain 39 value.\n\nI must deny this offer. I will then make a counter-offer. Given their clear need for Brick, I will try again to get my high-value Ore for my Brick.\n\nMy previous counter-offer of \"1 Brick -> 1 Ore\" was rejected. I need to make it more appealing to Player 0, *while still ensuring a gain for me*.\nWhat if I offer 2 Brick for 1 Ore and some other filler?\n2 Brick (value 58) for 1 Ore (value 39). This is a loss for me. No.\n\nI have an abundance of sheep. Maybe I can try to convert some sheep into more valuable resources.\nSheep value 17. Brick value 29. Ore value 39.\nWhat if I offer Player 0 a mix of Brick (which they want) and Sheep (which I have in abundance and is lower value than Brick)?\nAnd in return, I request Ore or Wood/Wheat only if the quantities provide a significant value increase.\n\nLet's go back to the single highest value commodity trade: Convert Brick to Ore.\nI need to offer *less* Brick for Ore, or demand *more* Ore for the same amount of Brick.\nTry again for 1 Ore. How much Brick am I willing to give up to get 1 Ore?\n1 Ore (value 39).\nCurrently, 1 Brick is value 29.\nIf I offer 1 Brick for 1 Ore, I gain 10 value.\nIf I offer 2 Brick (value 58) for 1 Ore (value 39), I lose value. Bad.\n\nWhat if Player 0 needs Wood or Wheat? They keep offering it.\nI need to ensure a positive value trade for me.\n\nCurrent Player 0 offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood (Value 39) -> 3 Brick (Value 87).\nI deny this.\n\nMy turn to make an offer. I want to sell Brick.\nLet's assume Player 0 desperately needs Brick.\nI will make an offer similar to my previous denied offer, but slightly adjusted to be more appealing, while still making me a profit.\nPrevious offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore (Net: +10 value for me) - Denied by P0.\nPerhaps 1 Brick for 1 Ore is too steep for Player 0 given their own internal valuation or resource availability.\n\nWhat about a trade that involves them giving me something they have in abundance (Wheat/Wood) and something I value highly (Ore)?\nBut I'm selling Brick.\n\nLet's maintain the goal of converting my abundant Brick into higher value resources like Ore.\nIf 1 Brick for 1 Ore was too much, what if I ask for 1 Ore and a bit of Wheat/Wood?\nProposed: 2 Brick (value 58) -> 1 Ore (value 39) + X Wheat/Wood. I still lose value here based on just Ore.\n\nI need to extract the most value. Player 0 has plentiful Wheat and Wood.\nI will try to get more Wheat and Wood *combined* for a smaller amount of Brick.\nThey offered 3 Wheat, 2 Wood (total value 39) for 3 Brick (total value 87).\nThis implies that for them, 3 Brick is worth 39, or 1 Brick is worth about 13.\nFor me, 1 Brick is worth 29.\nIf I offer 1 Brick (my value 29), I need to get something > 29.\nIf I offer 2 Brick (my value 58), I need to get something > 58.\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nI have 11 Ore, value 39.\nI have 18 Brick, value 29.\n\nMy best strategy is to convert my lower-value abundance (Brick or Sheep) into my higher-value scarcity (Ore) or into a total value gain from their high-value abundance (e.g. Wheat/Wood if they have a lot and I can get a large quantity).\n\nConsider the previous offers:\nP0 offered 3 Wheat, 2 Wood for 3 Brick. This is (3*5) + (2*12) = 15+24 = 39 value IN for 3 Brick = 3*29 = 87 value OUT. This is a Net -48 for me. Deny.\n\nI should try to offer a quantity of Brick that is tempting but gets me valuable resources.\nWhat if I offer 2 Brick (value 58)? What could I get? My goal is > 58 value.\nPerhaps 1 Ore (value 39) + 2 Wood (value 24) = Total 63. This is a net gain of +5.\nThis would be: [Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 2 Wood]\n\nThis is a subtle profit. Player 0 gains 2 Brick (which they seem to desperately want), while giving up 1 Ore and 2 Wood.\nIs 1 Ore and 2 Wood easier for them to part with than their original ask of 3 Wheat, 2 Wood for 3 Brick?\nThey value 3 Brick at 3 Wheat, 2 Wood (value 39). So, 1 Brick is \"worth\" about 13 to them.\nMy offer: 2 Brick. They get 2*13 = 26 of their 'perceived' value in Brick.\nThey give up 1 Ore (value 39) and 2 Wood (value 24) = 63.\nThis trade is a value loss for *them* based on my values (they give 63; get 29*2 = 58).\nBut they get Brick, which they want. The key is their perceived value.\n\nLet's simplify. My past direct Brick to Ore trade (1 Brick -> 1 Ore) was denied.\nThis implies 1 Ore (39) is too valuable for them to give up for just 1 Brick (29).\nPerhaps they need more Brick than 1. And maybe they don't value Ore quite as much, or they don't have enough to spare.\nWhat if I offer 2 Brick for 1 Ore? No, too much for me. (58 vs 39).\n\nThey keep offering Wheat and Wood. This is their abundance.\nI need to get a lot of it to make it worthwhile.\nHow much Wheat/Wood for 1 Brick? I need > 29.\n3 Wheat, 2 Wood is 39 value. This for 1 Brick is a net +10 for me.\nThis could be a good \"compromise\" offer. It matches the value they offered for 3 Brick.\nSo, I offer 1 Brick and get what they offered us initially for 3 Brick.\nLet's try that. It's a significant gain for me, and they get *some* Brick.\n\n**Considered Offer:** [Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wheat, 2 Wood]\nMy value gained: 39 (3 Wheat + 2 Wood)\nMy value lost: 29 (1 Brick)\nNet gain for me: +10 value.\nThis is a good value trade for me. It also directly mirrors the quantity of Wheat/Wood they repeatedly offered. They seemed willing to give 3 Wheat, 2 Wood. Now I'm asking for that amount for only 1 Brick, rather than 3. This should be much more appealing to them.\n\n**Action:**\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wheat, 2 Wood]",
