      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\nBefore making a trade, I analyze these key principles based on my current resource distribution and valuations:\n\n1. **Value Maximization Focus**: Prioritize trades where the *received resources' total value* exceeds the *offered resources' total value* to increase my net worth. My resource valuations per unit: Wheat=5, Wood=9, Sheep=14, Brick=20, Ore=32.\n\n2. **Leverage Surplus Resources**: I have surpluses in low-to-moderate value resources (Wheat: 17 units @5, Brick: 17 units @20). Trading these to acquire higher-value resources (especially Ore @32) or balance deficits (Wood @9, Sheep @14) is optimal.\n\n3. **Cost-Benefit Tradeoffs**: \n   - **Wheat (5)** is ideal for offloading; I value it least and have excess.\n   - **Brick (20)** is valuable but abundant; swapping it for higher-tier resources (e.g., Ore) at favorable ratios improves value.\n   - **Ore (32)** is my most prized resource; I should rarely offer it unless receiving substantial value gains.\n   - **Sheep (14)** is moderately scarce but not critical; acquiring more via low-cost trades adds value.\n\n4. **Negotiation Strategy**: \n   - Propose mutually beneficial offers: High-value targets for me (Ore, Sheep) may be less valuable to others.\n   - Start with moderately favorable offers to avoid rejection (e.g., slight net gains). No lowballing.\n\n5. **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid depleting Ore (current: 11), as its high value per unit is difficult to replenish efficiently.\n\n### Trade Decision\nAfter analysis, I propose:  \n**Offer: [Offer: 10 Wheat, 2 Brick -> 4 Sheep]**  \n\n#### Rationale:\n- **Value Calculation**:\n  - *Offering*: 10 Wheat (10 \u00d7 5 = 50) + 2 Brick (2 \u00d7 20 = 40) \u2192 **Total offered value: 90**.\n  - *Requesting*: 4 Sheep (4 \u00d7 14 = 56) \u2192 **Total received value: 56**.\n- **Net Gain**: 56 - 90 = **-34**? *Wait\u2014this appears unfavorable*. Correction needed:  \n  - Reevaluating: Goal is to increase **my** total value. If I give away 90 value for 56 in return, I **lose** 34 value. This violates Principle 1.  \n\n**Revised Offer**: Higher-value resource acquisition:  \n**Offer: [Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore]**  \n\n#### Why this works:  \n- **Value Analysis**:  \n  - *Offering*: 8 Wheat (8 \u00d7 5 = 40).  \n  - *Requesting*: 1 Ore (1 \u00d7 32 = 32).  \n- **Net Gain**: 32 - 40 = **-8**? *Still a loss*\u2014must aim for >=zero net gain.  \n\n**Optimized Offer (Applied Principles)**:  \n**Offer: [Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]**  \n\n#### Final Validation:  \n- **Offered Value**: 3 Brick \u00d7 20 = **60**.  \n- **Requested Value**: 2 Ore \u00d7 32 = **64**.  \n- **Net Gain**: 64 - 60 = **+4** (meets value maximization).  \n- **Resource Impact**:  \n  - Brick decreases to 14 (still abundant surplus).  \n  - Ore increases to 13 (preserves high-value reserve, nets +4 value).  \n- **Negotiability**: Fair offer\u2014another player needing Brick may accept, as Ore:Brick ratio (1.6:1) isn't extreme.  \n\n**Action**: [Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]",

BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)  \n   - My current position is strong; I\u2019m ahead in total value and well-balanced across high-value resources.  \n   - There is no urgent need for Wheat or Brick; I can wait for better offers that give me high-value resources (Ore) or at least do not overload me with Wheat.\n\nDecision: Although the numerical gain is positive, the strategic cost\u2014getting saddled with even more low-value Wheat\u2014outweighs the short-term gain.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. Value-delta test: Any trade must increase my total value. Your value is calculated as \u03a3 quantity \u00d7 unit-value.  \n   - Offer from Player 0: (10 Wheat, 2 Brick) = 10 \u00d7 5 + 2 \u00d7 29 = 50 + 58 = 108 of incoming value.  \n     (4 Sheep given away) = 4 \u00d7 12 = 48 of outgoing value.  \n     Net delta = 108 \u2013 48 = +60 \u21d2 **exactly the same total value** if the portfolio stayed uniform, but the basket of incoming resources has considerably lower per-unit value (Wheat 5, Brick 29) compared with Sheep 12 and the outgoing Sheep 12. Hence from YOUR perspective it would only be mildly value-positive, but you might still reject it if the new mix doesn't fit a clear plan.\n\n2. Opportunity-cost heuristic: the cheapest item for me to give up is the one whose marginal utility is lowest\u2014MY lowest unit-weighted value is Wheat (5). Wheat is the first thing I should offer because each unit sacrificed returns the least other-value.\n\n3. Diversification-in-scarcity principle: I\u2019m already long on Brick (29) and Ore (35). My current relative shortages are Wheat and Wood. Therefore acquiring Wheat and/or Wood and spending away Brick or Ore aligns with consolidation value, because an extra unit of a scarce resource gives larger marginal utility.\n\n4. Distancing rule: Always look two trades ahead\u2014if I offer something you\u2019re short on, your counter-offer may click more easily.\n\n5. Anchoring with polite surplus: Offer something slightly in your favour (5-10 %) to account for give-back in later negotiation rounds.\n\nApply the principles:\n\n- What I comfortably have in surplus: Ore and Brick.   \n- What would I like to tighten: Wheat (only 13 units) and Wood (11).  \n\nTherefore a balanced offer that boosts my Wheat and Wood at the cost of Brick and / or Ore fits knowledge points 2-3.\n\nCalculated delta-compliant offer:\nOffer 2 Brick + 2 Ore \u2192 5 Wheat + 2 Wood  \nIncoming value: 5\u00d75 + 2\u00d712 = 25+24 = 49  \nOutgoing value: 2\u00d729 + 2\u00d735 = 58+70 = 128  \nWait, that\u2019s a net loss, so flip. Instead the right way:  \nOutgoing resources (what you give): Brick 3, Ore 2 \u2192 Value = 3\u00b729 + 2\u00b735 = 87+70 = 157  \nIncoming: Wheat 10, Wood 2 \u2192 Value = 10\u00b75 + 2\u00b712 = 50+24 = 74.  \nThis again drops net value, confirming that the first swap direction is bad.\n\nSo flip polarity: I give Wheat or Sheep.  \nI benefit most by giving Wheat (because its unit-value is worst) to acquire higher-value goods.  \nPattern: I desire to raise Wheat total only if it comes at <unit Wheat 5> expense, else I must be careful.\n\nWait\u2014I actually only want extra Wheat **IF** it still gives marginal gain, but Player 0\u2019s previous offer tried to give me tons of Wheat, a low-value resource; I already rejected it.  \nBetter target is goods of me-high value \u2192 given away in minimal chunks for scarce low-value ones I lack.\n\nReal optimal neat package  \nTarget spending per marginal gain: convert my surplus Brick (29) into Wood (12) and maybe Sheep (12) because Wood is scarcest.  \nOffer: 4 Brick \u2192 7 Wood  \nIncoming: 7\u00b712=84  \nOutgoing: 4\u00b729=116 \u21d2 deficit; not enough Wood. Difference unit gap 29 vs 12 is just too wide.\n\nHence shift to giving Ore (my highest) only if we can sneak extra quanta. But Ore highest, no thanks.\n\nTherefore I will ask for Wheat to counter over-supply: Offer 3 Sheep, 2 Ore for 5 Brick, 2 Sheep (i.e. net giving 3S+2O \u21d2 36+70=106 and gaining 5B+2S \u21d2 145+24=169, a delta intended big swing towards my gap in Brick so that further I can flip those Bricks into Wood).\n\nCompute check:  \nGive: 3 Sheep\u00b712 + 2 Ore\u00b735 = 36+70 = 106  \nReceive: 5 Brick\u00b729 + 2 Sheep\u00b712 = 145+24 = 169  \nNet \u2248 +63 value, trade OK. Brick in my supply is already abundant (18\u219223), but this creates a super-surplus Brick stack (knowledge #3), which can immediately be leveraged in a subsequent round to get scarce Wood.\n\nThus apply.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]",

Losing them should only happen for either (a) an even larger swing in total value or (b) bundling them to obtain still-scarce resources.\n\n2. Current Inventory Analysis  \n   - Wheat and Wood are low-value and abundant; Sheep and Wood are tied at 12, but Sheep is slipping out\u2013I\u2019ve already sent 3 Sheep away in previous turns (from 11\u21928).  \n   - Brick is 18 \u2192 13 after earlier acceptances; its marginal value remains high because 13 is still comfortably large enough to trade (not too thin).  \n   - Ore at 17 is the single most lucrative card.\n\n3. Player 0\u2019s Pattern  \n   - Player 0 is extremely Brick-hungry (has repeatedly tried to give Wheat and Brick to acquire Brick net-plus; even offered 4 Brick \u2192 3 Ore just now).  \n   - Player 0 appears to be light on Ore (was willing to give up 3 Ore for just 4 Brick in their very last proposal).\n\n4. Negotiation Heuristics \u2013 Exploit revealed preferences  \n   - When the other side signal-bids so aggressively for one good (Brick), you either say \u201cno\u201d until the ratio rises or extract the maximal premium.  \n   - Since they value Brick so highly, package any outgoing Brick with minimal value loss and take the highest-value resources still missing in my bundle.\n\nApplying Knowledge to the New Offer:\n\nSituation right now  \n- Incoming: Player 0 offers 4 Brick \u2192 wants 3 Ore.\n\nValue check  \n- Outgoing: 3 Ore = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 value.  \n- Incoming: 4 Brick = 4 \u00d7 29 = 116 value.  \nNet swing = +11 in raw value.  \n\nDoes it advance my win condition (max my personal total value)? Yes.  \nIs there a way to push them even further? Not in this round\u2014this is a take-it-or-leave-it by them in the current turn. Additional negotiation rounds may never materialize before the 10-turn limit.\n\nConclusion  \nAccepting strictly maximizes my expected aggregate value (+11) and improves my Brick position at minimal Ore cost (17 Ore\u20133 = 14 is still ample).\n\nDecision:\n[Accept]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge  \n1. Marginal Value vs. Total Value: A deal increases my value only if the *marginal* value of what I receive is greater than the *marginal* value of what I give away.  \n2. Relative Scarcity Drives Marginal Value: I am flush with Wheat (5/ea) and Sheep-Wood (both 12/ea). Brick (29/ea) and Ore (35/ea) are scarcest. I should seek deals that turn abundant low-value assets into scarce high-value ones.  \n3. Bundling Low-Value Goods: Because Wheat and Sheep have low absolute value, I should try swapping *combinations* of them (or Wood) for a single high-value unit rather than trading high-value units in isolation.  \n4. Leverage Existing Surpluses: I hold 13 Wheat, 11 Sheep. A small reduction (e.g., 3\u20135 units) is trivial to my total wealth yet valuable to the counter-party if they lack those resources.  \n5. Counter-Party Pattern: Player 0 rejected the earlier Sheep + Ore bundle for Brick + Sheep bundle. However, they just accepted giving me high-value Ore for lower-value Brick (4 Brick \u2192 3 Ore). This suggests they value Ore even more highly than we do (35 to them may feel worth >35), while Brick is slightly less attractive (29 to them may feel \u226429).  \n6. Exploit Recent Acceptance: Since they just gave up high-value Ore for lower-value Brick, we may infer they now have *surplus Brick* and *low Ore*. Offering to give up lower-value Sheep/Wood/Wheat for more Brick is logical.\n\nApply Knowledge to Current Situation  \nCurrent totals after the last accepted trade:  \nOre 20, Brick 15, Wheat 13, Sheep 11, Wood 11 (values per unit: 35, 29, 5, 12, 12).\n\nI am rich in low-value Wheat. Player 0 just demonstrated they are willing to *give* Brick (29) away. Offering high *marginal-value-to-me* Brick in exchange for lower-value assets I have in abundance is the clear path.\n\nDecision: make an offer that bundles low-value Wheat with moderate Sheep for Brick.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 4 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge: Key Principles and Strategies for Resource Trading\n1. **Value Optimization Focus**: Prioritize trades that increase your total resource value. Calculate net value change by multiplying quantity by unit value for resources lost vs. gained.  \n2. **Scarcity and Surplus Management**: Trade surplus, low-value resources (e.g., Wheat) to acquire scarce, high-value ones (e.g., Ore). Reduce inventory imbalances without compromising critical stock (e.g., avoid depleting resources below operational needs).  \n3. **Marginal Utility**: High per-unit value resources (Ore:32, Brick:20) are \"premium\"\u2014trade them sparingly unless receiving disproportionately high returns. Low-value resources (Wheat:5) should be offloaded if they build value.  \n4. **Counterparty Behavior Analysis**: Previous trades show Player 1 values Brick highly (accepted 4 Brick for 3 Ore) but rejects Wheat-heavy deals. Leverage this to propose mutually beneficial offers targeting Brick\u2192Ore exchanges again. Avoid trades where Player 1 likely profits more.  \n5. **Risk Tolerance**: In late-game turns, favor high-certainty, proven trades over speculative offers to lock in gains.  \n\n### Trading Decision\n#### Step 1: Evaluate Player 1's Current Offer  \n- **Offer**: Player 1 gives 5 Wheat (Value: 5 each), 3 Sheep (Value: 14 each) \u2192 Requests 4 Brick (Value: 20 each).  \n- **Net Value Change for You**:  \n  - **Lose**: 4 Brick \u00d7 20 = -80 value  \n  - **Gain**: (5 Wheat \u00d7 5) + (3 Sheep \u00d7 14) = 25 + 42 = +67 value  \n  - **Net**: 67 - 80 = **-13 value loss**.  \n- **Resource Impact**:  \n  - Your Wheat increases from 17\u219222 (low-value surplus).  \n  - Sheep increase from 6\u21929 (moderate value).  \n  - Brick decreases from 13\u21929 (depletes high-value stock).  \n- **Strategic Risk**: Player 1 gains Brick (their high-priority resource) while dumping low-value Wheat. Declining prevents value erosion.\n\n#### Step 2: Apply Strategic Principles  \n- **Value Optimization**: Reject any deal with a net loss (here, -13).  \n- **Scarcity Management**: Brick (13 left) is worth preserving for premium trades. Ore (14) is optimal acquisition target due to highest value (32).  \n- **Counterparty Leverage**: Player 1 accepted 4 Brick\u21923 Ore before\u2014repeat this successful offer for +16 net value (+96 Ore vs. -80 Brick).  \n- **Action Priority**: Deny unfavorable offer, then initiate high-value trade leveraging your surplus Brick.  \n\n### Decision:  \n**Response to Player 1's Offer**: [Deny]  \n**New Trade Offer**: [Offer: 4 Brick -> 3 Ore]  \n- **Rationale**:  \n  - \u2717 Player 1\u2019s offer reduces your value.  \n  - \u2713 Your 4 Brick are surplus (13 retained \u21929; adequate stock).  \n  - \u2713 3 Ore provides +96 value vs. -80 Brick, gaining +16 net value.  \n  - \u2713 Uses Player 1\u2019s prior acceptance of this offer for reliability.",
