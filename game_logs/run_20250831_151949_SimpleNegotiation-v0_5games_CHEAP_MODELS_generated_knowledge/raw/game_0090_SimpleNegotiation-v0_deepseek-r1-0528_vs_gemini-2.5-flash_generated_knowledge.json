Increasing net value per trade is critical for cumulative gain.\n   \n2. **Leverage Surplus**: Abundant high-value resources (e.g., Brick at 25 units) can be traded strategically to acquire more units of equally or higher-valued resources (e.g., Sheep/Ore), but ensure exchange rates favor your value arithmetic. Avoid depleting scarce high-value resources (e.g., Ore at 5 units).\n\n3. **Demand-Based Negotiation**: Without opponent context, propose trades that appear quantity-attractive (e.g., 1 resource for multiple) to mask value imbalances. Target resources where opponent might perceive quantity gain (e.g., trading 1 Brick for 3 Sheep exploits Sheep's lower per-unit value, netting +7 value: 3\u00d712\u22121\u00d729=36\u221229=7).\n\n4. **Risk Mitigation**: If no net-gain trade is feasible, consolidate holdings (e.g., bundle low-value Wheat/Wood for mid-value Sheep) to improve future bargaining power.

The goal is to increase the *total value* of your holdings, not just the quantity.\n2. **Marginal Utility/Diminishing Returns:** While not explicitly stated, assume that having too much of one resource might make it less valuable to you, or that acquiring a scarce resource might be more valuable. This implies looking for trades that diversify or acquire high-value items.\n3. **Targeting High-Value Resources:** Prioritize acquiring resources that have a high unit value, especially if you can trade lower-value resources for them.\n4. **Strategic Trading:** Evaluate offers based on whether they increase your net worth. A good trade involves giving up resources that are less valuable to you (or you have in abundance) for resources that are more valuable or scarce.\n5. **Negotiation Leverage:** Your current holdings give you leverage. Abundant resources can be used to acquire scarce or high-value resources from others. Rare resources should be valued highly.\n6. **Understanding Opponent's Needs (Inferred):** Although Player 0's motivations aren't explicitly stated, their offer suggests they value Sheep more than Brick, or they have an excess of Brick.

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge: Key Principles and Strategies for Resource Trading\n\n1. **Value Maximization Focus**: Prioritize trades that increase your total resource value, based on your per-unit valuations. Avoid trades that result in net value loss unless they enable future high-value transactions.\n2. **Resource Valuation Hierarchy**: Use your assigned per-unit values to calculate exchange rates:\n   - **Ore** (38) is your highest-value resource, followed by **Brick** (29), **Sheep** (12), **Wood** (8), and **Wheat** (6).\n   - Aim to acquire high-value resources (Ore or Sheep) by trading lower-value or surplus resources.\n3. **Surplus Utilization**: Leverage abundant resources (e.g., Brick at 25 units) to acquire rarer, high-value resources. Brick's high per-unit value (29) makes it a strong bargaining chip.\n4. **Negotiation Response Analysis**: Player 1 rejected your previous offer (1 Brick for 3 Sheep). This suggests:\n   - Player 1 may value Sheep highly or perceive Brick as undervalued.\n   - Propose adjusted offers to test their valuation (e.g., slightly better terms) without compromising your net gain.\n5. **Trade Volume Strategy**: Larger trades can be more appealing but risk rejection if demands are high. Balance quantity and value: \n   - Your ideal: Trade Brick for Sheep at rates >2.4 Sheep/Brick (since 29 \u00f7 12 \u2248 2.42) to ensure value gain.\n   - Previously offered 3 Sheep/Brick (net gain: 3\u00d712 \u2212 29 = +7), rejected. Now propose 8 Sheep for 3 Brick (net gain: 8\u00d712 \u2212 3\u00d729 = +9).\n6. **Risk Mitigation**: Start with moderate offers to gather intel. If rejected, iterate with smaller requests or alternate resources (e.g., include Wheat to lower opponent resistance).\n7. **Game Turn Efficiency**: With 8 turns remaining, prioritize high-success probability offers. Avoid low-value resource acquisitions unless they offer clear margins (e.g., trading for Ore is difficult due to its 38 value).\n\n---\n\n### Trading Decision\nBased on the strategy above:\n- **Offer**: 3 Brick \u2192 8 Sheep.  \n  - **Value Calculation**:  \n    - Current value: 3 Brick = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87  \n    - Requested: 8 Sheep = 8 \u00d7 12 = 96  \n    - **Net Gain**: 96 \u2212 87 = +9 value  \n- **Rationale**:  \n  - Adjusts from your rejected 1 Brick \u2192 3 Sheep by offering a larger volume at a slightly improved rate (2.67 Sheep/Brick vs. 2.4 minimum for profit).  \n  - Brick surplus allows risk-free experimentation; gain sustains even if only partially accepted later.  \n  - Tests Player 1\u2019s Sheep valuation\u2014rejection could signal Sheep scarcity, guiding future Ore-targeted trades.  \n\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 8 Sheep]",

This helps determine which resources you prefer to give up and which you prefer to acquire.\n3.  **Identify Surplus/Deficit:** While not explicitly stated what constitutes a surplus or deficit in this game, having higher quantities of lower-value items (Wheat, Sheep) might make them more expendable if you can trade them for higher-value items. Conversely, large quantities of high-value items (Ore) are good bargaining chips but should be traded carefully.\n4.  **Objective: Increase Total Value:** Every trade should aim to increase your total resource value.

(Value of resources received) - (Value of resources given).\n5.  **Calculate Offer Value:** For the current offer: Player 0 is offering 3 Brick (3*21=63) and requesting 8 Sheep (8*12=96). This is a loss of 33 value for Player 1.\n6.  **Negotiation Posture:** Player 0's offers have been unfavorable so far. This trade is a significant loss. I need to be firm in rejecting bad offers and propose counter-offers that benefit me.\n7.  **Consider Player 0's Needs (Implicit):** Player 0 is offering Brick and requesting Sheep. This might indicate they have a surplus of Brick and a need for Sheep. This can be used to my advantage if I want to acquire Brick but not at a loss, or if I want to offload Sheep.\n8.  **Strategic Counter-Offering:** If I want to acquire Brick, I should propose a trade where I give up less value than I receive, or at least break even, while still providing Player 0 with the Sheep they seem to want. Conversely, if I want to offload Sheep, I need to ensure the exchange rate is favorable.\n\nThe current offer is: Offered items: 3 Brick -> Requested items: 8 Sheep.\nValue of 3 Brick = 3 * 21 = 63\nValue of 8 Sheep = 8 * 12 = 96\nThis trade results in a net loss of 96 - 63 = 33 for Player 1.

Player 0 seems to want Sheep and has Brick. I could aim to exchange Sheep for Brick, but only if the value is favorable to me.\n\nI will reject this offer. I should make a counter-offer that reflects my desire to increase my total value, potentially capitalizing on Player 0's apparent need for Sheep and willingness to part with Brick. If I aim to offload Sheep, I want more value in return. If I want Brick, I want it at a good price.\n\nLet's consider getting Brick for Sheep.\nPlayer 0 offered 3 Brick for 8 Sheep (63 value for 96 value).\nWhat if I offer 3 Brick for 5 Sheep? (3*21 = 63 value for 5*12 = 60 value). This gives me +3 value.\nOr 4 Brick for 7 Sheep? (4*21 = 84 value for 7*12 = 84 value). This is value neutral, which isn't ideal for increasing wealth, but could be a stepping stone.\nGiven Player 0's previous offers, they might be persistent. I need to propose something that generates value for me.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick for fewer Sheep.\nPlayer 0 offering 3 Brick for 8 Sheep. This implies they value 1 Brick at 8/3 ~ 2.67 Sheep.\nMy value of 1 Brick is 21. My value of 1 Sheep is 12. So 1 Brick is worth 1.75 Sheep to me (21/12).\nPlayer 0's implied ratio (2.67 Sheep/Brick) is much higher than my internal ratio (1.75 Sheep/Brick). This means Player 0 overvalues Sheep relative to Brick, in terms of trade. This works in my favor if I'm trading *Sheep for Brick*.\n\nI want to acquire higher value resources, like Ore or Brick, by giving up lower value resources, like Sheep or Wheat.\n\nLet's counter with an offer that favors me.\nI will consider trades where I acquire Brick.\nCurrent offer: 3 Brick (63) for 8 Sheep (96) = -33 value.\nI will offer to give less Sheep for the same Brick, or more Brick for the same Sheep.\n\nLet's target getting 3 Brick. I should offer less than 5 Sheep (which is 60 value, giving me +3).\nHow about 3 Brick for 4 Sheep? (3*21=63) for (4*12=48). This is +15 value for me. This might be too aggressive given previous rejections.\n\nLet's consider giving up some Wheat or Wood, which have the lowest values.\nIf I give up 3 Sheep (36) and 2 Wheat (10) = 46. For 3 Brick (63). Value +17.\nThis might be too complex for a first counter.\n\nLet's stick to the Brick for Sheep trade, but make it beneficial.\nPlayer 0 has offered 3 Brick for 8 Sheep.\nMy counter: Offer getting 3 Brick for 5 Sheep.\nValue gained: 3 Brick (63)\nValue given: 5 Sheep (60)\nNet gain: +3\n\nDeny\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 3 Brick]",

Exploit this by pushing for better Sheep-to-Brick ratios in future trades.  \n   - Reject any offer that reduces your total value.

Net +3.\nPlayer 0's implied counter to my 5 Sheep for 3 Brick was 8 Sheep for 3 Brick earlier.\nThis means Player 0 values 3 Brick as being worth somewhere between 5-8 Sheep.\nI need to find a point that's attractive to Player 0 but also significantly beneficial to me.\n\nPerhaps offering a combination of less valuable resources and some Sheep for higher value Brick?\nNo, the goal is to increase my own value. Pure resource swaps are easier to calculate.\n\nLet's try another offer with Sheep for Brick, but adjust the quantity to be more appealing to Player 0 while still offering a gain for me.\nConsider offering more Sheep for more Brick.\nWhat about offering 6 Sheep (72) for 4 Brick (84)? Net gain for me: 12. This is a better gain than the last offer.\nValue for Player 0: If they value Sheep less, and Brick more, 4 Brick for 6 Sheep could be attractive. This is a ratio of 1.5 Sheep/Brick, better than their 3 Sheep/Brick offer for me.\n\nI currently have 18 Sheep. Parting with 6 is significant but leaves me with 12.\n\nLet's stick to the high value resources.\nMy lowest value resource is Wheat. Player 0 isn't asking for it.\n\nConsidering player 0 always made negative offers when they initiated, and rejected my slightly positive one, I need to be careful.\nThey need Sheep. This is my leverage.\nMy current total value: 1511.\n\nLet's rethink the 5 Sheep for 3 Brick from last turn. It was a +3 for me. Player 0 rejected it.\nPlayer 0's offer of 3 Brick for 8 Sheep was a -33 for me.\n\nPlayer 0 offers 3 Brick for 8 Sheep, meaning they price 1 Brick at 2.66 Sheep.\nI offered 5 Sheep for 3 Brick, meaning I price 1 Brick at 1.66 Sheep.\nThe gap is between 1.66 Sheep and 2.66 Sheep per Brick for Player 0.\nMy new offer should be closer to Player 0's side of the 1 Brick value, but still net positive for me.\nLet's try to price 1 Brick at 2 Sheep. So, 3 Brick for 6 Sheep.\nIf I offer 6 Sheep (72) for 3 Brick (63), it's a net loss of 9 for me. This is bad.\n\nI need the trade to be profitable for me.\nIf Player 0 wants Sheep, I will give Sheep, but only for a good price.\nMy last good offer was 5 Sheep for 3 Brick (+3 value). Player 0 rejected.\nWhat if I offer slightly more Sheep for the same 3 Brick? Let's say 6 Sheep for 3 Brick, but then it's a loss for me. I can't do that.\n\nI should try to get *more* value than the 3 Brick if I'm giving more Sheep.\nWhat if I offer 7 Sheep for 4 Brick?\n7 Sheep value: 7 * 12 = 84\n4 Brick value: 4 * 21 = 84\nThis is a neutral trade for me in terms of value. I need to *increase* my value.\n\nSo, I need to find something that is obviously good for me, and also for Player 0.\nPlayer 0 needs Sheep. Player 0 is stingy with Brick.\n\nWhat if I try to get Ore instead of Brick using Sheep, as Ore is my highest value resource?\nOre is 35, Sheep is 12.\n1 Ore for 3 Sheep: 35 vs 36. Slight loss of 1 value. No.\n1 Ore for 2 Sheep: 35 vs 24. Significant gain of 11 value. Player 0 likely wouldn't accept.\n\nLet's go back to the Sheep/Brick trades because that's where the prior negotiation was.\nMy best offer was 5 Sheep for 3 Brick (+3 value). It was rejected.\nWhat if Player 0 needs a *quantity* of Sheep, rather than just a specific exchange rate? Maybe they want to get to a certain number quickly.\nIf I offer a larger quantity of Sheep, I should expect a larger gain.\n\nConsider 10 Sheep for 6 Brick.\n10 Sheep: 120\n6 Brick: 126\nNet gain of 6. This is double my previous gain (+3). It's also a larger quantity, which might incentivize Player 0.\nPlayer 0 might see this as a good deal if they are desperate for Sheep. They get a good chunk of Sheep (10), and give 6 Brick. Their previous offer of 3 Brick for 8 Sheep means they value 1 Brick at ~2.66 Sheep. Here I am asking about 1.66 Sheep per Brick (10/6). This is much better for me. It's likely they will reject this.\n\nWhat about a smaller, more frequent trade type? My initial 5 Sheep for 3 Brick was close.\nWhat if I try to offer a smaller amount of my lowest value (Wheat), potentially combined with Sheep? Probably too complex for now.\n\nLet's try to offer a slightly more favorable (to Player 0) version of my last rejected offer that still gives me a good gain.\nMy last offer: 5 Sheep (60) for 3 Brick (63). (+3 value for me) - Rejected.\nMaybe Player 0 wants the trade to be profitable for them too, or at least break-even?\nIf I offered 5 Sheep (60) for 3 Brick AND 1 Wood (10)? Total value 73. Then net gain 13. Player 0 unlikely to sell Wood.\n\nI have 18 Sheep. I can part with some. Player 0 keeps asking for it.\nRe-evaluate the 3 Brick for 8 Sheep offer from Player 0. It was a -33 for me. So 3 Brick is valued by Player 0 as more than 8 Sheep.\n\nMaybe Player 0 sees Brick as much more valuable than I do.\nIf Player 0 sees Brick as having higher value, they will not give me 3 Brick for just 5 Sheep.\nPerhaps I need to adjust my perception of what I can *get* for my Sheep.\n\nLet's try a small loss for Player 0, but a clear gain for me.\nMy internal valuation:\n1 Brick = 21\n1 Sheep = 12\nSo, 1 Brick is roughly 1.75 Sheep (21/12).\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (24) for 1 Brick (21), it is a loss of 3 for me. Fail.\nIf I offer 1 Sheep (12) for 1 Brick (21), it is a gain of 9 for me. Player 0 will never accept.\n\nI have 18 Sheep.\nLet's make a new offer that still means a net gain for me, but is a bit more attractive to Player 0 if their goal is to acquire Sheep.\nWhat about offering 7 Sheep for 4 Brick? As calculated before, this is value-neutral. I can't do neutral.\n\nI need a *net increase* in total value.\nMy current offer of 5 Sheep for 3 Brick (+3 value) failed.\nI have a lot of Ore. Player 0 wants Sheep. Can I acquire more high-value resources by giving Sheep?\nI have 24 Ore (35 value each), 18 Sheep (12 value each).\n\nLet's consider going for Ore.\nIf Player 0 has Ore and wants Sheep, they might trade.\nOffer: 3 Sheep (36) -> 1 Ore (35). This is -1 for me. No.\n\nIf I consistently make offers that are only slightly profitable for me, Player 0 will keep rejecting them if they are only thinking of their own profit.\nI need to find a trade that offers a decent profit for me, but maybe a slight loss or neutral for Player 0, given their evident need for Sheep.\n\nWhat if I offer a larger number of Sheep for a proportionately larger amount of Brick/Ore, such that the net gain for me is significant?\nFor example, offering a lot of Sheep for just a bit of Ore.\nI have 24 Ore. Perhaps Player 0 has less Ore and needs it, or is abundant in it.\n\nLet's look at the valuations again:\nSheep: 12\nBrick: 21\nOre: 35\n\nI need to get more value than I give.\nConsider offering a lot of Sheep to get a high-value resource like Ore.\nIf I give 4 Sheep (48) for 1 Ore (35)? This is a loss of 13 for me. No.\nIf I give 2 Sheep (24) for 1 Ore (35)? This is a gain of 11 for me. This is a very good deal for me. Player 0 might reject.\n\nLet's try 3 Sheep for 1 Ore. That was -1 value. Still no.\n\nLet's go back to Brick. Player 0 keeps offering Brick *for* Sheep.\nMy last offer: 5 Sheep -> 3 Brick (value: 60 -> 63) was +3 for me. Rejected.\nPlayer 0's last rejected offer: 3 Brick -> 8 Sheep (value: 63 -> 96) was -33 for me. Rejected.\n\nThis means Player 0 expects *more* Sheep for 3 Brick than 5, but *less* than 8.\nSo, for 3 Brick, Player 0 would accept something between 6 and 7 Sheep.\nIf I give 6 Sheep (72) for 3 Brick (63), it's a value loss of 9 for me. I cannot accept this unless I get something else, or if the value of Brick is actually higher for future builds (which I don't know).\nIf I give 7 Sheep (84) for 3 Brick (63), it's a value loss of 21 for me. I cannot accept.\n\nSince my profit of +3 (5 Sheep for 3 Brick) was rejected, Player 0 is not interested in trades where they incur a slight loss or are neutral/small gain for them. They want to profit, or at least break even, and get Sheep.\n\nWhat if I offer something else *in addition* to Sheep to get Brick?\nMaybe 5 Sheep + 1 Wheat (60+5=65) for 3 Brick (63). This is +2 for me, but now I'm giving multiple resources.\nAnd if Player 0 only wants Sheep, adding Wheat makes it less attractive.\n\nI have an abundance of Wheat (18) and Sheep (18). Wood (5) is low.\nWhat if I try to get rid of Wheat for something more valuable?\nI could offer a large amount of Wheat for a small amount of Sheep, Wood, Brick, or Ore.\nOffer: 10 Wheat (50) -> 3 Sheep (36). Loss of 14 for me. Bad.\nOffer: 10 Wheat (50) -> 2 Brick (42). Loss of 8. Bad.\n\nThe consistent request from Player 0 is Sheep.\nI need to leverage this.\n\nMy options are:\n1.  **Modify existing Sheep for Brick negotiations:** Try a different quantity or ratio.\n2.  **Propose Sheep for a different resource (Ore):** See if Player 0 has Ore and is willing to part with it for Sheep.\n3.  **Propose divesting low-value resources:** Though Player 0 has not shown interest in Wheat or Wood.\n\nLet's go with option 1, as there's a clear history here.\nPrevious negotiation indicates 3 Brick is worth between 5 and 8 Sheep for Player 0.\nMy valuation: 3 Brick (63) is worth 5.25 Sheep (63/12).\nIf I want to gain value, I need to get 3 Brick for <5.25 Sheep.\nIf Player 0 accepts 5 Sheep for 3 Brick, it's a positive trade for me. But it was rejected.\n\nThis implies that Player 0 wants a profit from me for their Brick, or at least equal value, when they trade for Sheep.\nThey are willing to offer 3 Brick for 8 Sheep. If they value 3 Brick at 63, and 8 Sheep at 96, this is a 33 point gain for Player 0. That's a huge profit margin.\n\nI need to offer a trade where *I* make a profit.\nIf 5 Sheep for 3 Brick was rejected, I need to either:\na) Ask for more Brick for 5 Sheep - Unlikely to be accepted.\nb) Offer fewer Sheep for 3 Brick - But 5 Sheep is already a stretch for Player 0.\nc) Offer the same amount of Sheep (or slightly more) for *more* value.\n\nHow about 6 Sheep for 4 Brick?\nValue: 6 Sheep = 72. 4 Brick = 84.\nNet gain for me: +12. Much better than +3.\nAnd the ratio of Sheep/Brick for Player 0 is 6/4 = 1.5. This means Player 0 is giving 1.5 Sheep for 1 Brick.\nTheir earlier rejected offer to me (3 Brick for 8 Sheep) was 2.66 Sheep per Brick for me.\nMy rejected offer (3 Brick for 5 Sheep) was 1.66 Sheep per Brick for me.\n\nMy new offer of 6 Sheep for 4 Brick is 1.5 Sheep per Brick for me.\nThis is better for me than the previous 1.66 Sheep/Brick (less Sheep given per Brick obtained).\nPlayer 0 rejected 1.66 Sheep/Brick (5 Sheep for 3 Brick). Will they accept 1.5 Sheep/Brick (6 Sheep for 4 Brick)?\nIt's possible. It means for the same amount of Sheep, they would get more Brick.\nWait, my ratio calculation is reciprocal to theirs.\nMy offer: (offered sheep) / (requested brick)\nPrevious: 5 Sheep / 3 Brick = 1.66\nNew offer: 6 Sheep / 4 Brick = 1.5\n\nThis means I am asking for *more* Brick per Sheep. For Player 0, they are *giving up* 1.5 Sheep for each Brick.\nMy previous offer of 5 Sheep for 3 Brick meant Player 0 would give away 1.66 Sheep for each of their Brick. This was rejected.\nSo, my *new* offer is *more* favorable to me, and thus *less* favorable to Player 0.\nThis is likely to be rejected.\n\nI need to find a sweet spot where Player 0 feels like they are achieving their goal (getting Sheep) at a reasonable cost, and I am increasing my value significantly.\n\nLet's try a counter-offer that bridges the gap between my 5 Sheep for 3 Brick and their 8 Sheep for 3 Brick.\nPlayer 0 wants Sheep. I have Sheep.\nWhat if I offer something like 7 Sheep for 4 Brick?\nValue: 7 Sheep = 84. 4 Brick = 84. Net 0. Cannot do.\n\nOkay, let's look at it from Player 0's side of profit.\nTheir offer of 3 Brick for 8 Sheep was +33 value for them.\nMy offer of 5 Sheep for 3 Brick was -3 value for them.\nI need to make an offer that is slightly negative for them, or neutral, but clearly positive for me.\nIf Player 0 is giving out 3 Brick for 5 Sheep, they lose 3 value.\nIf Player 0 gives out 3 Brick for 6 Sheep (72), they GAIN 9 value (72-63=9).\nIf I offered 6 Sheep for 3 Brick: I lose 9 value. Bad.\n\nThis is a tough negotiation. Player 0 seems to want a very profitable deal for themselves and is not willing to concede much for Sheep, despite their repeated requests.\n\nMy priority is *increasing my total value*.\nI have 1511 value.\nI have a lot of Sheep. Can I use it to get Ore?\nWhat if I offer 3 Sheep (36) and 1 Wheat (5) = 41 for 1 Ore (35). Loss of 6 for me. No.\n\nI must make a trade that increases my value.\nThe consistent play from Player 0 is \"we want Sheep, we give Brick, but we want a lot of Sheep for it.\"\n\nWhat if I offer a *higher* amount of Sheep for slightly more Brick, still aiming for value gain?\nLet's try to get more than 3 Brick.\nIf I offer 7 Sheep for 4 Brick: Value 84 vs 84 (neutral). Failed objective.\n\nI need to make a move. The previous negotiations show a clear disagreement on the value of Sheep/Brick.\nMy priority: increase value. My abundance: Sheep, Ore, Wheat.\n\nWhat if I made a really strong value gain offer even if it's likely rejected, to signal my position?\nI could try this: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nValue: 2 Sheep = 24. 1 Brick = 21. Net loss for me of 3. No. I need to gain.\n\nMy profit-making offers are repeatedly rejected.\nI have 18 Sheep. I can spare enough to make a large trade if it's profitable.\nLet's consider going back to an offer that is clearly profitable for me, but maybe less aggressively so than 5 Sheep for 3 Brick.\nNo, 5 Sheep for 3 Brick *is* the lowest I should go for 3 Brick.\n\nMaybe Player 0 doesn't have many Bricks? Or values them extremely high.\nGiven the constant rejections, I should try something slightly different.\n\nI will propose a trade that is value-positive for me, targeting Brick as they seem to have it and want Sheep.\nMy last offer (5 Sheep for 3 Brick, profit +3 for me) was rejected.\n\nWhat if I offer 6 Sheep for 4 Brick? (Value: 6S=72, 4B=84) +12 value for me. This is where I calculated it was less favorable to Player 0.\nThis makes me re-think. How can I structure an offer that they would find appealing to get Sheep, but still gives me value?\n\nI have Wheat (low value, high quantity). I also have plenty of Sheep.\nIf Player 0 is consistently valuing Brick highly and Sheep lowly, I need to try to get *some* value increase.\n\nLet's try to get Ore. Ore is my highest value resource.\nI have 24 Ore. Perhaps Player 0 has less Ore.\nIf I offer: 2 Sheep (24) -> 1 Ore (35). This is a +11 gain for me. A strong gain. Player 0 might reject if they value Ore highly.\nBut Player 0 wants Sheep. They might be willing to pay a high price in Ore for Sheep.\n\nLet's make a clear, simple offer that gives me significant value.\nIf Player 0 sees this as a good chance to gain Sheep, they might accept.\n\nIf I propose 2 Sheep (24) for 1 Ore (35), this is a solid +11 gain for me.\nThe ratio is 2 Sheep for 1 Ore. (24/35 = ~0.68)\nPlayer 0 is interested in Sheep. I am offering a decent quantity (2), for a high-value resource.\n\nMy total current value: 1511. If this trade goes through:\nResources before: Sheep 18, Ore 24\nResources after: Sheep 16, Ore 25\nValue before: (18*12) + (24*35) = 216 + 840 = 1056 (partial value)\nValue after: (16*12) + (25*35) = 192 + 875 = 1067 (partial value)\nNet gain: 11.\n\nThis is a clear profit.\nIf Player 0 is desperately seeking Sheep, they might take this.\n\nFinal decision: I will offer 2 Sheep for 1 Ore.\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge:\n1. **Value-Based Trading**: Prioritize trades where the received resources' total value exceeds the given resources' value to ensure a net gain. My current valuations are critical for decision-making:\n   - Wheat: 6, Wood: 8, Sheep: 12, Brick: 29, Ore: 38.\n   - Brick has the highest per-unit value (29) and my largest surplus (25). Sheep\u2019s value is modest (12), but trades involving Brick must account for its high worth.\n\n2. **Trade Calculus**:\n   For any trade:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Value Change} = \\sum (\\text{Received Qty} \\times \\text{Value}) - \\sum (\\text{Given Qty} \\times \\text{Value})\n   \\]\n   - Avoid net losses unless a strategic necessity exists (e.g., acquiring scarce Ore). No current urgency justifies a loss.\n   - Opponent\u2019s offers (e.g., 5 Sheep for 3 Brick: net loss of 27 for me; 2 Sheep for 1 Brick: net loss of 5) are unfavorable and must be denied.\n\n3. **Surplus Leverage**: \n   - Offset Brick\u2019s high value by bundling trades for proportional gains. Aim for \u2265 2.5 Sheep per Brick to ensure profit (since 2.5\u00d712 = 30 > 29). Past offers (1 Brick for 3 Sheep \u2192 rejected) suggest the opponent resists a 3:1 ratio; a compromise like 2 Brick for 5 Sheep (2.5 Sheep/Brick, net gain +2) is worth reattempting.\n\n4. **Opportunity for Ore**: \n   - Ore is scarce (Qty: 5) and high-value (38). An offer like 1 Brick for 1 Ore would net +9 value. Given the opponent hasn\u2019t engaged Ore trades, however, Sheep remains the pragmatic focus based on their offers.\n\n5. **Negotiation Dynamics**: \n   - Opponent\u2019s actions indicate Brick demand but at overly discounts. Deny unfavorable offers but counter with marginally improved decks (e.g., reducing ask from 3:1 to 2.5:1 Sheep per Brick) to incentivize deal closure.\n\n### Trading Decision:\nThe incoming offer from Player 1: **Offered: 2 Sheep \u2192 Requested: 1 Brick** yields a net value loss of **5** (calculated: 2\u00d712 - 29 = -5). Decline this detrimental trade. Instead, propose a counter-offer to increase total value:\n\n#### Offer Structure:\n- **Given**: 2 Brick (cost: 2\u00d729 = 58)  \n- **Requested**: 5 Sheep (gain: 5\u00d712 = 60)  \n- **Net Value Change**: +2 (profitable)  \n- **Rationale**: Meets the 2.5 Sheep/Brick threshold. It\u2019s less aggressive than prior asks but mutually closes the gap while adhering to value-based principles.\n\n### Action:\n- **Response to incoming offer**: `[Deny]`  \n- **New offer to Player 1**: `[Offer: 2 Brick -> 5 Sheep]`",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. **Value Assessment:** Before any trade, quickly calculate the total value of your current resources. This provides a baseline.\n2. **Marginal Value Analysis:** When considering an offer, calculate the per-unit value of resources. Understand which resources are \"cheap\" for you to give away and which are \"expensive\" for you to acquire based on your current holdings and their intrinsic value.\n3. **Profit Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of your resources. This means trying to give away resources that are low value to you (or you have in abundance) for resources that are high value to you (or you need).\n4. **Strategic Reserves:** Be mindful of resource quantities. Don't trade away too much of a high-value resource if it leaves you with very little, as it might limit future trading options or reduce your ability to meet other game objectives (if any, though not specified here).\n5. **Understanding Opponent's Needs (Inferred):** While not directly known, past offers from Player 0 can give clues about what they might value or need. For example, Player 0 has consistently offered Brick for Sheep, suggesting they might value Sheep more than Brick, or have an abundance of Brick.\n6. **Anchoring and Counter-Offers:** The first offer often sets an anchor. If an offer is bad, a counter-offer should move in a direction that's more favorable to you.\n7. **Patience vs. Urgency:** The game has 10 turns. This allows for iteration. It's not necessary to accept the first profitable trade if better ones might emerge, but also don't be so rigid that no trades happen.\n8. **Opportunity Cost:** What are you giving up by not making a different trade?\n9. **Current Situation Analysis:**\n    *   **My Resources & Values:**\n        *   Wheat: 18 * 5 = 90\n        *   Wood: 5 * 10 = 50\n        *   Sheep: 18 * 12 = 216\n        *   Brick: 15 * 21 = 315\n        *   Ore: 24 * 35 = 840\n        *   Total Value: 1511\n    *   **Player 0's Offer:** 2 Brick (42 value) -> 5 Sheep (60 value)\n    *   This is an attempt by Player 0 to gain 5 Sheep for 2 Brick. From Player 0's perspective, they want to give 42 value to get 60 value. From my perspective, I would lose 60 value to gain 42 value, resulting in a net loss of 18 value. This is a bad trade for me.\n    *   Player 0 has consistently offered Brick for Sheep, and I have consistently rejected. My previous counter-offer was 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick which was rejected. Player 0 previously offered 3 Brick -> 8 Sheep. My current offer was 5 Sheep -> 3 Brick.\n\nTrading Decision:\nThe current offer from Player 0 (2 Brick for 5 Sheep) is a loss for me (I give 60 value and receive 42 value). I have consistently rejected such offers where I lose value. Player 0 has also rejected my offers where I gain value. Player 0 appears to value Sheep highly. I have a good quantity of Sheep (18) and a good quantity of Brick (15). I previously offered 2 Sheep for 1 Brick, which means I valued 1 Brick at 2 Sheep (24 value). Player 0 wants 5 Sheep for 2 Brick (42 value). The difference is still significant. I need to make an offer that is profitable for me, but maybe closer to what Player 0 might eventually accept without incurring a huge loss.\n\nLet's re-evaluate value for Sheep and Brick:\nMy Brick value: 21\nMy Sheep value: 12\n\nPlayer 0's offer: Give 2 Brick (42 value) for 5 Sheep (60 value). Value loss for me: 18.\nMy previous offer: Give 2 Sheep (24 value) for 1 Brick (21 value). Value gain for me: -3 (negligible loss, effectively a desperate attempt to get rid of sheep for something of similar value).\nMy more profitable offer (rejected by Player 0): Give 5 Sheep (60 value) for 3 Brick (63 value). Value gain for me: 3.\n\nPlayer 0 continues to offer trades where I lose significant value. I won't accept this offer. I need to make a counter-offer that slightly benefits me and might be acceptable to Player 0 given their apparent need for Sheep.\n\nI currently have 18 Sheep and 15 Brick.\nLet's try to get 1 Brick for less than 2 Sheep.\nMy last accepted offer from P1 was \"2 Sheep -> 1 Brick\" (was rejected by P0). This suggests Player 0 wants more Sheep for their Brick.\nIf I give 3 Sheep (36 value) for 2 Brick (42 value), I gain 6 value. This might be a stretch for P0.\nIf I give 4 Sheep (48 value) for 2 Brick (42 value), I lose 6 value. Not good for me.\n\nPlayer 0 offered 2 Brick for 5 Sheep. (I give 60, get 42; I lose 18)\nI will counter with an offer that still values my Sheep highly but shows some flexibility.\nMy previous profitable offer (5 Sheep -> 3 Brick) was rejected. This was a direct counter to a larger offer from P0.\n\nI need to make an offer that is profitable for me and might be tempting for Player 0 given their desire for Sheep.\nPlayer 0 is continuously trying to get Sheep from me. I have 18 Sheep.\nLet me propose a trade where I get more value for my Sheep.\nIf I give 4 Sheep (48 value) for 3 Brick (63 value), I gain 15 value. This is a very good trade for me, but might be too much for P0.\n\nLet's consider a smaller increment.\nPlayer 0 offered 2 Brick for 5 Sheep.\nHow about 1 Brick for 2 Sheep plus 1 Wheat (Wheat is cheap for me: 5 value)?\n[Offer: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick] gives me (21 value) and costs me (24+5 = 29 value). This is a loss. Not good.\n\nI need to gain value.\nCurrent offer is 2 Brick for 5 Sheep. I lose 18 value.\nThis indicates Player 0 values Sheep highly.\n\nLet me try to exchange more of my lower value resources for high value ones.\nWheat: 5, Wood: 10, Sheep: 12, Brick: 21, Ore: 35.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat and Sheep. I want more Ore and Brick.\n\nGiven Player 0's consistent offers for Sheep, they clearly want Sheep. I have 18 Sheep. I can afford to give some if the price is right.\nPlayer 0 offered 2 Brick for 5 Sheep.\nI will counter by offering fewer Sheep for the same 2 Brick, or more Brick for the same Sheep.\n\nLet me try for 2 Brick (42 value) for 3 Sheep (36 value). This gives me +6 value.\nThis reverses Player 0's requested value. My previous offer was 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick.\n\nI'll propose a trade that gives me a net positive, but is aggressive enough to signal my unwillingness to be fleeced.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",

Calculate net value change (received value minus given value) for every offer.  \n2. **Marginal Utility**: Resources with high quantity (e.g., Brick at 25) have lower marginal utility. Trading surplus high-value resources for multiple lower-value resources can yield net gains if values align.  \n3. **Negotiation Leverage**: Repeated rejected offers signal the other player's valuation. Player 1 consistently rejects Brick-for-Sheep deals but counteroffers with Sheep/Wheat, indicating they value Brick highly but seek lower ratios.  \n4. **Incremental Gains**: Small positive net gains (+1 or more) are acceptable, especially in late game stages, as opportunities diminish.  \n5. **Resource Liquidity**: Wheat and Sheep have moderate values (6 and 12) but higher trade flexibility; accumulating them may enable future advantageous trades.  \n\n### Trade Analysis  \nPlayer 1's current offer:  \n- **Receive**: 2 Sheep (Value: 2 \u00d7 12 = 24) + 1 Wheat (Value: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6) \u2192 **Total Received Value: 30**  \n- **Give**: 1 Brick (Value: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29)  \n- **Net Gain**: 30 \u2212 29 = **+1**  \n\nThis yields a **positive net gain**, leverages Brick surplus, and aligns with history (Player 1's counteroffers trend toward lower Brick ratios).

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade should ideally result in receiving resources whose value is greater than the value of the resources I give up.\n2.  **Scarcity and Demand:** Resources with higher individual values (like Ore, Brick, Sheep) are generally more desirable. Understanding which resources the opponent might need (even if their value is lower to me) can open up trading opportunities.\n3.  **Relative Value Comparison:** Calculate the per-unit value of each resource.\n    *   Wheat: 5\n    *   Wood: 10\n    *   Sheep: 12\n    *   Brick: 21\n    *   Ore: 35\n4.  **Identifying Undervalued/Overvalued Resources:** Look for opportunities to trade away resources I have in abundance and value less for resources I have less of and value more. Currently, Wheat and Wood have the lowest per-unit value. Ore and Brick have the highest. Sheep is mid-range but I have a lot of it.\n5.  **Small Incremental Gains:** Even small value gains per trade accumulate over 10 turns. Don't wait for massive \"perfect\" trades.\n6.  **Understanding Opponent's Offers:** Analyze the opponent's past offers. Player 0 has consistently tried to trade Brick for Sheep. This indicates Player 0 might value Brick less than Sheep, or has an abundance of Brick and a need for Sheep. Player 0 seems to be giving 1 Brick for 2.5-3 Sheep (value 21 for 30-36). This is a bad deal for me.\n7.  **Leveraging Abundance:** I have significant quantities of Wheat, Sheep, and Ore. I can afford to trade some of these, especially Sheep, for higher-value resources like Brick, as long as the value exchange is in my favor.\n8.  **Past Successful Trade:** My last trade (2 Sheep, 1 Wheat for 1 Brick) was accepted. This implies Player 0 valued 1 Brick as greater than or equal to (2*12 + 1*5 = 29), and I gained 21 for 29, which was a loss from a pure value perspective. However, it successfully got me Brick, which is a higher-value resource by unit. I should aim for better value exchange. The previous rejection of 5 Sheep -> 3 Brick (60 -> 63) indicates Player 0 thought my gain was too high. The acceptance of 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick (29 -> 21) was actually a loss for me, so I need to be careful not to make trades that outright lose my value. The game goal is to increase *total* value.\n\nCurrent Resources and Values:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 18 (Value: 90)\n*   [Wood] Qty: 5 (Value: 50)\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 16 (Value: 192) - *Correction from previous turn's successful trade: 18 - 2 = 16*\n*   [Brick] Qty: 16 (Value: 336) - *Correction from previous turn's successful trade: 15 + 1 = 16*\n*   [Ore] Qty: 24 (Value: 840)\nTotal Value: 90 + 50 + 192 + 336 + 840 = 1508\n\nMy last trade: I gave 2 Sheep (24) and 1 Wheat (5) for 1 Brick (21). This was a trade where I gave up 29 value to get 21 value. This decreased my total value. My primary goal is to increase value. I need to be more careful. The previous acceptance of this trade indicates Player 0 needs Sheep/Wheat or values Brick low.\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 2 Brick -> 5 Sheep (Value: 42 vs 60) - Rejected. This was a good rejection. Player 0 still wants Sheep.\nMy last accepted trade was a net *loss* for me. I need to flip this.\n\nMy observation: Player 0 offered (1 Brick -> 3 Sheep), then (3 Brick -> 8 Sheep), then (2 Brick -> 5 Sheep). These are all attempts to get Sheep for Brick at a loss for me. Player 0 *accepted* my offer of (2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick).\n\nThis indicates Player 0 *really* wants Sheep, and is willing to give Brick for it, but not at a rate that is too advantageous for me. The past accepted trade shows Player 0 is willing to give 1 Brick (21) for 2 Sheep (24) and 1 Wheat (5), which is 29 value. Player 0 *gained* 8 value from that trade, and I *lost* 8 value. This is the opposite of my goal.\n\nI need to offer a trade where I gain value. Player 0 clearly wants Sheep. I have a lot of Sheep. I want more high-value items, especially Ore or Brick.\n\nLet's try to get more than 1 Brick, or trade away my low-value Wheat.\nPerhaps: I offer a small amount of low-value resources for a small amount of high-value resources.\nOr: I offer Sheep, but for a better ratio than before.\n\nPlayer 0's persistence in getting Sheep suggests they value it highly or need it. I have a good quantity of Sheep (16). Brick is good, but Ore is best.\n\nLet's capitalize on Player 0's apparent need for Sheep.\nIf Player 0 was willing to give 1 Brick for 2 Sheep and 1 Wheat (value 21 for 29), let's try to get a better deal for Brick.\nWhat if I try to get a higher-value resource, like Ore? Player 0 has not offered Ore.\n\nLet's offer a combination of resources that are less valuable to me for a more valuable one, while ensuring I gain value.\nI have a significant amount of Ore. Maybe Player 0 wants Ore? No indication.\n\nGiven Player 0's past offers, they seem to be trying to get Sheep for their Brick.\nI want to increase my value.\n\nConsider 1 Brick = 21. Player 0 offered 2 Brick -> 5 Sheep (42 -> 60). Bad for me.\nMy previous successful trade: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick (29 -> 21). Bad for me.\n\nI need to shift this pendulum.\nI will try to trade Sheep for Brick, but ensure I come out ahead on value.\nIf I give 1 Sheep (12), I want more than 12 value in return.\nIf I give 2 Sheep (24), I want more than 24 value in return.\n1 Brick (21) is less than 2 Sheep (24). So 2 Sheep for 1 Brick is a bad trade for me.\n\nMy goal: total value increase.\nResources I want more of: Brick (21), Ore (35).\nResources I have a lot of/value less: Wheat (5), Wood (10), Sheep (12).\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Wheat and 1 Wood for 1 Brick? (5+10 = 15 value for 21 value). This is a gain of 6 value. It's a small gain, but strategic. It gets rid of my lowest value items for a higher value item. Player 0 has accepted higher losses before.\n\nLet's propose: 1 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick.\nValue given: 10 + 5 = 15. Value received: 21. Net gain: 6.\nThis directly addresses my goal of increasing total value, and offloads low-value resources.\n\nFinal decision for the trade:\n[Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "### Knowledge Generation\n- **Value-Based Trading Principle**: Prioritize trades that increase your total value. Calculate the net value gain/loss by comparing the value of offered vs. requested resources using your fixed valuations. Accept only if net gain is positive.\n- **Resource Scarcity and Opportunity Cost**: \n  - Brick is your highest-value resource (29 per unit) but abundant (24 units after the last trade). Protect it for high-return trades.\n  - Ore is your most valuable resource (38 per unit) but scarce (5 units). Prioritize acquiring it if possible.\n  - Wheat (value 6) and Wood (value 8) are low-value and relatively plentiful (15 Wheat, 13 Wood). Trades giving these for Brick result in high losses.\n- **Counteroffer Strategy**: If a received offer is unfavorable, consider making a counteroffer targeting resources like Ore or a better Sheep/Wood ratio to improve value gain.\n- **Negotiation Context**: Player 1 values Brick (as seen in all offers), but they offer decreasing compensation. Avoid \"lowball\" offers\u2014only accept if value justifies it. Given game length (10 turns), focus on decisive gains.\n\n### Application to Current Situation\n- **Current Received Offer**: \n  - Player 1 offers: 1 Wood (value 8) + 1 Wheat (value 6) = total **14 value**.\n  - You give: 1 Brick (value **29**).\n  - **Net loss**: 14 - 29 = **-15 value**. This decreases your total.\n- **Strategy Alignment**: The massive net loss from giving 1 Brick for low-value resources violates core principles. Brick (29) should be traded only for high-value returns (e.g., Ore) or bundles exceeding its value (e.g., Sheep at 12 each). Accepting would waste resources.\n- **Alternatives**: If denying, consider a counteroffer for Ore or Sheep (e.g., offering Brick for Ore at favorable ratios). Prioritize deals that increase value by 15+ to offset past minor gains.\n\n### Trading Decision\n[Deny]  \n*// Reasoning: Accepting would lose 15 value. Hold Brick for trades aligning with value-based principles\u2014e.g., targeting Ore or higher Sheep bundles.*",
