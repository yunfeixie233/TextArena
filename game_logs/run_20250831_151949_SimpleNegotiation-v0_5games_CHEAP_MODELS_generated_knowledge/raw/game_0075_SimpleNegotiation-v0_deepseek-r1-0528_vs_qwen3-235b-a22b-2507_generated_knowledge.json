      "response": "### Generated Knowledge: Key Principles and Strategies for Resource Trading\n\n1. **Value Maximization Principle**: Prioritize trades where the total value gained exceeds the value given. Trade low-value resources (per unit) for high-value ones to increase overall portfolio value.  \n   - *Current resource values per unit*: Wheat(5) < Wood(11) < Sheep(13) < Brick(30) < Ore(37).  \n   - **Strategy**: Target gaining Brick or Ore, as they offer the highest value per unit. Sacrifice Wheat/Wood/Sheep when feasible.\n\n2. **Resource Scarcity and Surplus**: Leverage abundant resources (Wheat: 20, Ore: 16) to acquire scarce, high-value resources (Brick: only 7). Avoid depleting critical high-value stock (e.g., limit Ore trades unless return is highly favorable).  \n   - **Risk**: Over-trading Sheep (low quantity: 6) could reduce flexibility.  \n\n3. **Negotiation Leverage**: Start with moderately aggressive offers to test opponent\u2019s valuation. Bundle low/mid-value resources to \"sweeten\" deals for high-value targets. Expect counteroffers\u2014aim for win-win to sustain exchanges.  \n   - **Caution**: Opponent\u2019s valuation is unknown\u2014offers should balance self-gain with plausibility.  \n\n4. **Efficiency Over Quantity**: A few high-value trades are better than multiple low-impact deals. Focus on Brick trades (gain 30/unit) using Wheat/Wood (cost 5\u201311/unit). Small Ore trades may be viable if return \u22652x value (e.g., 1 Ore \u2192 2 Brick).  \n\n5. **Turn Optimization**: With 10 turns total, prioritize high-value-per-trade actions. Avoid [Deny]/[Accept] unless incoming offers align with value goals.\n\n### Trading Decision\nApplying the above, I propose a trade that offloads low/mid-value surplus (Wheat/Sheep) for high-value Brick.  \n- **Offer**: Give 10 Wheat (value: 50) and 1 Sheep (value: 13) to request 4 Brick (value: 120).  \n  - **Net gain**: 120 - 50 - 13 = **+57 value**.  \n  - **Rationale**: Uses abundant Wheat and minimal Sheep (retaining 5 Sheep) for maximum Brick gain. Initially tests opponent\u2019s Brick valuation while incentivizing acceptance.  \n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 4 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Resource Value Assessment**: Each resource has an intrinsic value (Wheat: 5, Wood: 10, Sheep: 17, Brick: 28, Ore: 32). The goal is to increase the total value of my holdings. Therefore, any trade should ideally result in a net positive gain in total value, or position me for higher-value trades later by acquiring scarce or highly valuable resources.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost and Scarcity**: I currently have high quantities of Sheep (25) and Ore (24), which are high-value resources. Brick (value 28) is also valuable, and I have 9 units. Wheat (value 5) is low-value, and I already have 6, so acquiring more is less desirable unless traded for much higher value in return.\n\n3. **Trade Leverage**: Player 0 offered 10 Wheat (10 \u00d7 5 = 50 total value) and 1 Sheep (17) \u2192 total offered value = 67. Requested: 4 Brick (4 \u00d7 28 = 112). This is a losing trade for me\u2014offering only 67 value to take 112 value. I rejected wisely.\n\n4. **Counteroffer Strategy**: To maximize value, I should consider offering surplus resources (like Sheep or Ore) in exchange for higher-value resources like Brick or Wood, or even build toward a bundle that could be used in future synergistic trades. However, I should avoid giving away too much high-value stock (e.g., Ore) for lower-value returns.\n\n5. **Negotiation Power**: Having surplus of high-value resources (Sheep, Ore) gives me strong negotiation power. I can selectively offer moderate amounts of Sheep or Ore to acquire Brick or Wood at favorable rates.\n\n6. **Incremental Gains**: Since the game lasts 10 turns, I can afford to wait, but should not be passive. Making one strong, value-positive offer now could initiate a productive trading chain.\n\n7. **Trade Ratios**: I should aim for trades where the value of resources received is strictly greater than the value of resources given, or where the trade improves flexibility for future high-value exchanges.\n\nApply Knowledge:  \nMy current total value:  \n(6 \u00d7 5) + (5 \u00d7 10) + (25 \u00d7 17) + (9 \u00d7 28) + (24 \u00d7 32) =  \n30 + 50 + 425 + 252 + 768 = **1,525**\n\nPlayer 0\u2019s initial offer was unfavorable. I should now make a strategic counteroffer using my surplus Sheep and/or Ore to acquire Brick, which is valuable and may be in demand.\n\nPotential Offer:  \nOffer: 5 Sheep (5 \u00d7 17 = 85) and 2 Ore (2 \u00d7 32 = 64) \u2192 total offered: 149 value  \nRequest: 5 Brick (5 \u00d7 28 = 140) \u2192 total received: 140  \nSlight value deficit? Wait\u2014better to offer slightly less or request more.\n\nAlternatively:  \nOffer: 3 Sheep (51), 2 Ore (64) \u2192 total 115  \nRequest: 5 Brick (140) \u2192 net gain 25 value. That\u2019s favorable.\n\nBut is Brick worth 28? Yes. Do I want more Brick? Yes\u2014high value.\n\nPlayer 0 just tried to get 4 Brick, so they likely value Brick highly.

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\n- **Value Maximization Principle**: Prioritize trades that increase total portfolio value. Calculate net gain/loss by comparing the value of resources given vs. received.  \n- **Resource Valuation**: Use given per-unit values (Wheat=5, Wood=11, Sheep=13, Brick=30, Ore=37). High-value resources (Brick, Ore) should be traded cautiously unless the net gain is substantial.  \n- **Leverage Surplus Resources**: Offload low-value surplus (20 Wheat) to acquire high-value assets (Brick) but adjust offers if rejected (e.g., add moderate-value Wood).  \n- **Counteroffer Strategy**: If an offer is unfavorable, counter with a mutually beneficial proposal. Focus on your strong positions (abundant Ore) to propose asymmetric gains (Ore \u2192 Brick).  \n- **Risk Management**: Avoid depleting high-value/low-quantity resources (Brick only 7).

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\nBefore making a trade, I'll outline key principles and strategies relevant to my situation, derived from negotiation and trading fundamentals:\n\n1. **Resource Valuation Priority**:\n   - Focus on **net value gain**. Trade resources where I have lower intrinsic value (e.g., Wheat at 5) for higher-value resources (e.g., Brick at 30). Avoid trading high-value resources (Ore at 37) unless the return significantly outvalues the cost.\n   - Brick and Ore are my highest-value resources. Acquiring more Brick is ideal since I have fewer (Qty: 7) versus Ore (Qty: 16).\n\n2. **Surplus Utilization**:\n   - Leverage abundant low-value resources (Wheat: 20) to offload excess while targeting scarce high-value resources. Wheat trades are low-risk due to its low value and high quantity.\n   - Ore is high-value but abundan\u2014trading it can be strategic if I receive disproportionate Brick returns, but over-trading risks diminishing returns.\n\n3. **Opponent Behavior Analysis**:\n   - Player 1 rejected past offers involving Wheat and Ore. They covet Brick (attempted to acquire 5 Brick via a prior unfair offer) and avoid losing it. They may undervalue Sheep (offered 3 Sheep in their proposal).\n   - Player 1 likely prioritizes Brick and Ore, but their rejection of my reasonable offers (e.g., 2 Ore \u2192 3 Brick) suggests they value Brick more than I do.\n\n4. **Risk Mitigation**:\n   - Propose unbalanced offers favoring me, using surplus resources to incentivize acceptance. Avoid \"fair\" trades\u2014exploit valuation differences.\n   - Sheep (Value: 13) is a viable bargaining chip; it\u2019s mid-value and less critical to hoard.\n\n5. **Counteroffer Strategy**:\n   - Reject offers that cause net loss (e.g., Player 1\u2019s 3 Sheep + 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick: cost me 150 value, gained 113). Craft counteroffers using Wheat/Sheep to preserve Ore/Brick.\n\n---\n\n### Trading Decision\nI plan to **propose a new trade** targeting Brick using my surplus Ore and Wheat.  \n**Rationale**:  \n- **Offering**: 1 Ore (Value: 37) + 1 Wheat (Value: 5). *Total Cost: 42*.  \n- **Requesting**: 2 Brick (Value: 60). *Total Gain: +18 value*.  \nWhy this works:  \n- Low cost to me (Wheat is expendable; Ore surplus mitigates loss).  \n- Appeals to Player 1\u2019s focus on Ore while demanding fewer Brick than before (reducing rejection risk).  \n- Opponent may accept since they prioritized Ore in their historical offer.  \n\nIf rejected, I\u2019ll pivot to Sheep-based offers next turn.  \n\n**Action**:  \n[Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick]",

Avoid trades that deplete high-value resources unless the return is significantly favorable.\n   \n2. **Resource Scarcity and Leverage**: \n   - Brick is highly valuable (30) but scarce (only 7 units). Acquiring more Brick is optimal but challenging, as Player 1 has consistently rejected Brick-focused offers.\n   - Ore is abundant (16 units) and high-value (37). Trading surplus Ore can be strategic if it secures Brick or other high-value returns, but avoid undervaluing it.\n   - Wheat is low-value (5) and abundant (20 units). Use it as a \"sweetener\" in offers to absorb rejection risk without significant loss.\n\n3. **Negotiation History Insights**:\n   - Player 1 values Brick highly, rejecting all offers requesting it (e.g., 10Wheat+1Sheep\u21924Brick, 2Ore\u21923Brick, 1Ore+1Wheat\u21922Brick). \n   - Player 1 previously offered to trade Sheep and Ore for Brick (3Sheep+2Ore\u21925Brick), indicating they may undervalue Ore or Sheep relative to Brick. Capitalize on this by offering Ore-acquisition deals.\n   - Rejected offers suggest Player 1 requires better value ratios. Propose trades with clear net gains for them (e.g., bulk low-value resources for fewer high-value ones).\n\n4. **Risk Mitigation Strategy**: \n   - Avoid overcommitting scarce resources (Brick, Sheep). Focus on Wheat/Wood offers to preserve high-value stockpiles.\n   - If Brick acquisition fails, target Ore to compound value gains incrementally. Ore trades can yield high returns due to its value (37) and abundance.\n\n5. **Optimal Trade Structure**: \n   - **Target Ore**: Player 1 may accept Wheat-for-Ore trades, as Ore was offered previously. Wheat has minimal value loss (5) vs. Ore's high gain (37). A ratio of 6\u20137 Wheat per Ore ensures Player 1 profits while you gain net value.\n   - **Avoid Brick Requests**: Shift focus from Brick to Ore until Player 1 shows flexibility. Revisit Brick later if opportunities arise.\n\n### Trading Decision\nGiven the history and principles above, I propose an **Ore-focused trade** using surplus Wheat.  \n- **Offer**: 11 Wheat \u2192 2 Ore  \n  - **Value Calculation**:  \n    - Give: 11 Wheat \u00d7 5 = 55 value.  \n    - Receive: 2 Ore \u00d7 37 = 74 value.  \n    - **Net Gain**: 74 - 55 = +19 value.  \n- **Rationale**:  \n  - Wheat is low-value and abundant (20 units \u2192 9 left after trade). No risk to critical resources.  \n  - Player 1 previously offered Ore (indicating willingness to trade it), and this offer provides them with a large Wheat quantity at a favorable ratio (5.5 Wheat per Ore).  \n  - If accepted, this significantly boosts my total value with minimal downside.  \n\n**Action**: [Offer: 11 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: \n\n1. **Resource Valuation and Opportunity Cost**  \n   - Each resource has a fixed value: Wheat (5), Wood (10), Sheep (17), Brick (28), Ore (32).  \n   - Trading should aim to increase the total value of my holdings. I must ensure that the value of resources received > value of resources given.  \n   - Current inventory is heavy in Sheep (25) and Ore (24), with moderate Brick (9) and Wood (5), and lower Wheat (6).  \n   - Brick and Ore are the highest-value resources, so acquiring more of them is generally favorable if possible.\n\n2. **Surplus and Scarcity Strategy**  \n   - I have an abundance of Sheep (25) \u2014 possibly more than immediately useful. This makes Sheep a good candidate for trading away.  \n   - I have relatively high Ore (24), so giving up small amounts may be acceptable depending on return.  \n   - Brick is highly valuable (28), and I only have 9 \u2014 not excessive. I should be cautious about giving up Brick unless receiving significantly higher value in return.  \n   - Wheat is low in value and I only have 6 \u2014 I should avoid giving away Wheat unless receiving high-value resources (e.g., Ore or Brick).\n\n3. **Incremental Offers and Concession Management**  \n   - The opponent (Player 0) has made increasingly generous offers for Brick: first 10 Wheat + 1 Sheep for 4 Brick (poor for me), then 2 Ore for 3 Brick (still bad, as 3\u00d728=84 vs 2\u00d732=64 \u2014 I lose value), then 1 Ore + 1 Wheat for 2 Brick (value: give 37, get 56 \u2014 favorable), and finally 11 Wheat for 2 Ore (value: give 55, get 64 \u2014 slightly favorable).  \n   - Earlier, I offered 3 Sheep + 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick: value given = 3\u00d717 + 2\u00d732 = 51 + 64 = 115; value received = 5\u00d728 = 140. This would have been profitable (net +25), but Player 0 rejected it \u2014 likely because it was too favorable for me.\n\n4. **Counteroffer Strategy**  \n   - To make a compelling but profitable offer, balance value gained with what the other player might accept.  \n   - Player 0 seems to value Brick highly (they keep requesting them) and is willing to trade Wheat/Ore for them.  \n   - I can leverage my surplus Sheep to acquire Brick or Ore.  \n   - A revised offer could use slightly more Sheep (low opportunity cost) and minimal Ore, in exchange for 4\u20135 Brick.\n\n5. **Value-Based Trade Filtering**  \n   - Only accept trades where value received > value given.  \n   - When offering, ensure positive net value or strategic benefit (e.g., acquiring critical high-value resources).\n\nCurrent Situation:  \nPlayer 0 just offered: 11 Wheat \u2192 2 Ore  \nValue given by them: 11\u00d75 = 55  \nValue received by me: 2\u00d732 = 64  \nNet value for me: +9 \u2192 slightly favorable.\n\nBut I must compare this with better possible trades. I have Sheep to spare. Could I get more value by offering, say, Sheep + minimal Ore for multiple Brick?\n\nBest move: Improve my previous offer slightly to make it more acceptable while still profitable.\n\nNew offer idea:  \nOffer: 4 Sheep + 1 Ore \u2192 Request: 5 Brick  \nValue given: 4\u00d717 + 1\u00d732 = 68 + 32 = 100  \nValue received: 5\u00d728 = 140  \nNet gain: +40 \u2014 excellent for me.\n\nBut might be too generous on my side? Wait \u2014 140 vs 100, so I profit by 40, but Player 0 gives 140 value for 100 \u2014 they might not accept. Need balance.\n\nTry a more balanced one:  \nOffer: 5 Sheep \u2192 Request: 3 Brick  \nValue given: 5\u00d717 = 85  \nValue received: 3\u00d728 = 84  \nNet: -1 \u2014 almost even, slightly in my favor.\n\nBut previous offers were rejected \u2014 need to make it attractive.\n\nAlternatively:  \nOffer: 6 Sheep \u2192 4 Brick  \nValue given: 6\u00d717 = 102  \nValue received: 4\u00d728 = 112 \u2192 net +10 \u2014 good.\n\nBut I have 25 Sheep \u2014 can afford to trade some.\n\nAlternatively, accept Player 0\u2019s current offer?  \nThey offer 11 Wheat \u2192 2 Ore  \nI give nothing. Receive 2 Ore (value 64).  \nWait \u2014 no: for me, this is *receiving* 2 Ore and *giving* 11 Wheat. But I only have 6 Wheat \u2014 cannot give 11.\n\nCritical: I only have 6 Wheat. Cannot accept any offer requiring more than 6 Wheat from me.\n\nPlayer 0's current offer: \"Offered items: 11 Wheat -> Requested items: 2 Ore\" \u2014 this is **them offering 11 Wheat**, **requesting 2 Ore from me**.\n\nSo: they give 11 Wheat, I give 2 Ore.\n\nBut I only have 24 Ore \u2014 can afford to give 2.\n\nValue to me:  \n- Receive: 11\u00d75 = 55 (Wheat)  \n- Give: 2\u00d732 = 64 (Ore)  \nNet loss: -9 \u2014 **unfavorable trade**.\n\nSo I should **reject**, which I already did implicitly.\n\nNow, I must make a new offer.\n\nBest strategy: use my Sheep surplus to get Brick.\n\nTry: Offer 4 Sheep \u2192 Request 3 Brick  \nValue give: 4\u00d717=68  \nValue get: 3\u00d728=84 \u2192 net +16 \u2014 good profit.\n\nI have 25 Sheep \u2014 can spare 4.\n\nBrick is valuable \u2014 3 Brick = 84 value.\n\nLikely acceptable as it's close to fair (not heavily skewed).\n\nAlternatively, Offer 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick  \nValue: 51 vs 56 \u2192 net +5 \u2014 safe but small gain.\n\nBut prior offers were for more \u2014 so aim higher.\n\nBest offer: 5 Sheep \u2192 4 Brick  \nValue: give 85, get 112 \u2192 net +27 \u2014 excellent.\n\nDoable? I have 25 Sheep \u2014 yes.\n\nPlayer 0 might accept since they have excess Wheat and possibly find Sheep useful.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 4 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge for Resource Trading and Negotiation:\n\n1. **Value Maximization Principle**: Prioritize trades that increase your total resource value. Calculate net gain by valuing resources per unit: Wheat(5), Wood(11), Sheep(13), Brick(30), Ore(37). A favorable trade requires:  \n   *(Value of received resources) > (Value of given resources)*.\n\n2. **Strategic Focus**:  \n   - **High-Value Resources**: Brick (30) and Ore (37) are your most valuable. Accept trades only if net value gain is significant; avoid trading them for lower-value items.  \n   - **Low-Value Resources**: Wheat (5) has high surplus (20) and low value\u2014trade aggressively for better returns.  \n   - **Scarcity Awareness**: Brick stock is low (7)\u2014preserve it unless gaining high-value/Ore. Sheep (13) is medium-value; trade if net gain exceeds opportunity cost.\n\n3. **Negotiation Dynamics**:  \n   - Player 1 values Brick (consistently requests it) but rejects unbalanced offers. Ore may be undervalued by them (offered at loss in prior moves).  \n   - Past failures suggest Player 1 won\u2019t accept Wheat-centric trades. Focus offers on Ore or surplus Wheat for Brick/Ore.  \n   - Endgame leverage: Final turn\u2014prioritize deals ensuring clear gains; reject unfavorable proposals.\n\n4. **Optimal Trade Structure**:  \n   - **Target**: Trade Wheat (low value) for Brick/Ore (high value) or Sheep trades must yield +20% net value gain to justify.  \n   - **Avoid**: Trading Brick (30) for Sheep (13)\u2014value loss is unacceptable.\n\n### Trading Decision:\n- **Current Offer Analysis (from Player 1)**:  \n  Offer: Receive 5 Sheep (Value: 5 \u00d7 13 = 65), Give 4 Brick (Value: 4 \u00d7 30 = 120).  \n  **Net Change**: 65 \u2013 120 = **\u201355 value**.  \n  **Verdict**: Harmful\u2014reduces total value sharply.  \n\n- **Decision Rationale**:  \n  Brick is high-value and scarce (only 7 left); trading 4 for Sheep would irreversibly devalue inventory.
