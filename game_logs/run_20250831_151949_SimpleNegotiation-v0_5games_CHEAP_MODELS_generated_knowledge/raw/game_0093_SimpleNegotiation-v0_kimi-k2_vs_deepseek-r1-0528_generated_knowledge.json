Prioritize acquiring resources with higher individual values (Ore:40, Brick:30) while offloading lower-value ones (Wheat:5, Wood:11), adjusting for relative scarcity.\n2. **Resource Quantity Analysis**: Leverage abundant resources (e.g., Wheat:24, Sheep:22) for trades to minimize opportunity cost. Preserve scarce high-value resources (Ore:5) unless trading for even greater value.\n3. **Opponent Offer Evaluation**: Assess an incoming offer by calculating net value change. If the received value is less than what is given away (factoring in your valuations), the trade is disadvantageous.\n4. **Strategic Counter-Offering**: When denying an offer, propose an alternative that aligns with your value goals. Target high-value resources (Ore, Brick) by offering surplus lower-value ones (Wheat, Sheep) to create net gains.\n5. **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid trades that erode value or compromise resource diversity.

This indicates Player 0 may value Brick highly.\n5. **Negotiation Tactics**:  \n   - Bundle low-value resources to make offers more appealing (e.g., Wheat + Wood for Ore).  \n   - Avoid trading Brick/Ore unless receiving disproportionate value.  \n   - Target incremental gains; small net-positive trades accumulate over turns.\n\n### Trading Decision\n**Analysis**:  \n- **Goal**: Increase total value by offloading low-value Wheat/Wood for high-value Ore.  \n- **Opportunity**: Player 0 rejected 7 Wheat for 1 Ore (+5 gain).

      "response": "Generate Knowledge  \n1. Marginal-utility lens: The higher your stock of any resource, the lower the relative value of each additional unit and the less pain you feel giving it up. Therefore, I should be most willing to trade away the resources where I am deepest.  \n   - Ore is currently 20 units (highest stock), and its listed value-per-unit (34) is the highest, but because consecutive ore cards still count only 34 each, each marginal ore I possess is a good bargaining chip.  \n   - After Ore, Brick (18) is the thickest stack. Wheat (7) and Wood (13) sit much lower; Sheep (15) is moderate.  \n\n2. \u201cValue arithmetic\u201d rule: An acceptable deal must increase my aggregate \u201cpoint-buy\u201d worth (sum of quantity \u00d7 listed value for each resource after the trade). For me to propose a trade, the immediate net gain must appear favourable to me without the opponent correctly perceiving it as negative for them (otherwise they will simply reject).  \n\n3. Scarcity signalling: Players repeatedly try to pry Ore from me (offers containing Ore requests keep coming). That signals Ore is scarcer for them. Knowing this, I can safely demand a small premium when unloading Ore, but not so much that the gap looks exploitative.  \n\n4. Multiples-of-four heuristic: Sheep and Wheat are often thresholded cards in many games (e.g., development-card buys), so chunks of four are mentally attractive to opponents. Offering or asking in blocks of four tends to reduce counter-party framing bias against the trade.  \n\nApply the above:  \n\n- Target: Convert 4 high-stock Ore (4\u00d734 = 136 points) into a mix of lower-stock resources to spread risk and raise future leverage, while ensuring the package reaches at least 137 points of value for me so the deal is strictly positive.  \n- Best appetite of opposing player has repeatedly been Wheat (>1:1 Wheat-to-Ore already offered), so bundled Wheat plus Wood (of which I have 13) offers synergy.  \n- Offer: 4 Ore \u2192 5 Wheat, 2 Wood. If accepted my gain is (5\u00d75 + 2\u00d712) = 49 vs 136 going out. That\u2019s negative! Need richer ratio.  \n- Recalc: 3 Ore \u2192 5 Wheat, 4 Brick. (5\u00d75 +4\u00d723)=117 vs 3\u00d734=102.

Calculate net value changes (received value - given value) to ensure gains.\n\n2. **Resource Priorities**:\n   - **Ore (40)** is highest-value/lowest-quantity.

Trade only if net gain justifies it, as it anchors portfolio value.\n   - **Sheep (17)**/***Wood (11)**: Moderate value; Wood is riskier to trade due to lower quantity (9 after recent trade).\n\n3. **Opponent Behavior**:\n   - Player 0 covets **Wheat** (offered Ore for it in 3/4 trades) and now **Brick**, suggesting they undervalue Ore or need commodities. Exploit their demand.\n   - They rejected unbalanced offers (e.g., 4 Wheat + 1 Wood for 1 Ore) but accepted 5 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore last turn. Repeating favorable terms may succeed.\n\n4. **Negotiation Strategy**:\n   - **Reject losing deals**: Player 0's current offer (-25 value) is exploitative.
