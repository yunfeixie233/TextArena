      "response": "Generate Knowledge \u2013 most relevant insights for my current situation:\n\n1. Marginal-value bursts and trade-offs  \n   - My **Brick** is the scarcest and most valuable resource in my portfolio (26 points). Losing even one brick has a large marginal cost.  \n   - My **Ore** (32) is slightly more valuable to me than Brick per-unit, but I currently own 23 units, so its marginal unit value has diminished (holding extra copies has little payoff).  \n   - My **Sheep** (15) is abundant (13 units) and has moderate value. Traded away sheep will not hurt me unless I go below my immediate usage.  \n   - Open-ended games like Catan-like negotiations usually reward **\u201cexpanding infrastructure\u201d**: converting surplus low-yield resources (sheep/wood) into higher-return resources unless a building requires them.  \n\n2. ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement)  \n   - I should accept an offer only if the **value I receive exceeds the value I give away** (using my own per-unit valuations).  \n   - Inversely, I should propose terms that benefit me at least as much as they hurt the other player (net positive valuation shift for me and ideally benefit the other player moderately).  \n\n3. Reverse engineering Player 0\u2019s needs  \n   - Player 0 has already made two consecutive trades seeking **Brick** (requested 5 brick first, then 4 brick). This signals a **strong need for Brick**\u2014either to build something or because they are very short.  \n   - They offered **Ore** in the last proposal, suggesting they value Brick over Ore.  \n\n4. Opportunity-cost pruning  \n   - Rejecting any offer doesn\u2019t incur a direct penalty; failure to trade wastes the turn. I must therefore formulate a **counter-offer every turn** unless an incoming offer provides a net gain.  \n\nApplying the knowledge:\n\nStep A \u2013 Re-evaluate Player 0\u2019s final offer \u201c3 Ore \u2192 4 Brick\u201d with my valuations in points:\n\nMy current valuations per unit:  \nBrick 26, Ore 32.\n\nTrading 4 Brick costs me 4\u00d726 = 104 points.  \nReceiving 3 Ore gains me 3\u00d732 = 96 points.  \nNet change = 96 \u2013 104 = \u20138 points. Rejecting is correct.\n\nStep B \u2013 Design a profit-maximizing counter-offer  \nBecause Player 0 needs Brick badly and I can afford to give up some Wood or Sheep, I can **demand a premium on Brick** while offering something I consider less valuable.  \n\nI have excess **Wood (22 units valued at 8)** and excess **Sheep (13 units valued at 15)**; on the other hand, I already have \u226520 Ore and Brick.  \nMy goal: **acquire more Brick or Ore while off-loading low-value surplus**.\n\nOffer proposition:  \nGive: 4 Wood + 2 Sheep (value to me = 4\u00d78 + 2\u00d715 = 32 + 30 = 62)  \nReceive: 2 Brick + 3 Ore (value to me = 2\u00d726 + 3\u00d732 = 52 + 96 = 148)  \n\nNet gain = 148 \u2013 62 = +86 value points for me.  \nFor Player 0, this would give them 4 Wood + 2 Sheep (needs unknown), but my surplus is their extra.

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\n\n1. **Understanding Resource Value**: Each resource has a different value based on its quantity and demand. In this case, Ore (value 33) is the most valuable, followed by Brick (value 20), Wheat (value 6), Wood (value 8), and Sheep (value 17).\n\n2. **Supply and Demand**: Traders typically aim to acquire resources they lack or need for future trades. It is important to assess the needs of the other player while making an offer.\n\n3. **Negotiation Strategy**: When trading, gradually increasing the value of the offer or including a balanced mix of resources can often result in more successful trades. It's useful to make offers that provide clear value for both parties.\n\n4. **Leverage Quantity**: Having a larger quantity of specific resources can allow for better trades. For example, Player 0 holds a significant amount of Sheep and Brick, which should be utilized in negotiations.\n\n5. **Flexibility**: Being open to adjusting offers based on the other player's responses can aid in achieving a successful negotiation. If an offer is rejected, it\u2019s prudent to analyze what aspects may have been unappealing to propose an improved alternative.\n\n### Trading Decision\n\nGiven that previous offers have been rejected and considering the resources Player 1 has shown interest in (mostly Brick and Ore), it would be beneficial to offer a trade that balances valuable resources while trying to acquire some of necessary resources like Brick for expansion and structure development.\n\nI'll try to make a more enticing offer with more attractive resources while still maintaining value. \n\nCurrent Offer:\n- Offer 4 Sheep and 3 Wheat \n- Request 4 Brick and 2 Wood\n\nThe hope is that this offer is sufficiently attractive due to the amount of resources and offers a good exchange ratio, given that I hold a large quantity of Sheep and Wheat.\n\n#### Making the Offer\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 4 Brick, 2 Wood]",
