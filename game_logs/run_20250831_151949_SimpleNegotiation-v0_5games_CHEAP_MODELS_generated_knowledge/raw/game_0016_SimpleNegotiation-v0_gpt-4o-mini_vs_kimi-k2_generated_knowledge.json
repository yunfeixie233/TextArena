      "response": "### Relevant Knowledge on Resource Trading and Negotiation\n\n1. **Value Assessment**: Always assess the value of your resources compared to others in the game. Resources have varying quantities and values, and trading should aim to maximize value retention and growth.\n\n2. **Scarcity and Demand**: Understand which resources are scarce and which are in higher demand among other players. Resources that are high in demand can often be traded for more valuable commodities.\n\n3. **Trade Ratios**: Be aware of standard trade ratios for resources. Common trades often involve a balance where 2 or 3 units of a less valuable resource can yield 1 unit of a more valuable resource.\n\n4. **Diversification**: Keep a balanced portfolio of resources. This helps in negotiating since you can offer a variety of trades instead of relying on a limited few.\n\n5. **Long-Term Strategy**: Think beyond immediate gains. Consider how your trades affect your position in future turns. Sometimes it may be beneficial to hold onto certain resources to leverage in later turns for better trades.\n\n6. **Negotiation Tactics**: Use persuasive language and good communication skills. Being friendly and cooperative can lead to favorable deals, while aggressive tactics can build animosity.\n\n7. **Counter Offers**: Be prepared to counter offers. Often, the initial offer can be modified to reach a more advantageous deal.\n\n### Trading Decision\n\nGiven the current resources and their values, I have 14 Wheat, 20 Wood, 5 Sheep, 14 Brick, and 15 Ore. My most valuable resources are Ore and Sheep, while Brick has a high value, especially compared to other resources at the moment. \n\nI will assess the value propositions:\n\n- **Brick** is highly valuable at 30. I can trade some Ore, which has significant value (32) in exchange for Brick to further increase my total value. \n\nTherefore, I'll make an offer that seems beneficial based on the current situation:\n\n**Trade Offer**:  \n- Offer: 3 Sheep (value 54) and 2 Ore (value 64)  \n- Request: 5 Brick (value 150) and 2 Sheep (value 36)\n\nThis trade maximizes my value since I'm trading resources that I still have in abundance (Sheep and Ore) for a highly valuable resource (Brick).\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]",

Marginal value vs. average value  \n   In trading, consider the marginal value of the last unit you keep vs. the marginal value of the first unit you receive.  Moving exact quantities so that relative marginal value increases is the way to raise total value.\n\n4.

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge: Key Principles and Strategies for Resource Trading and Negotiation\n\n1. **Understanding Resource Value**: It's crucial to assess the value of the resources at hand. Each resource has a different value associated with it, and understanding these values can help make better trade decisions.\n\n2. **Balancing Quantities and Values**: When trading, the quantities offered should ideally match or exceed the value of the requested resources. A good balance between quantity and perceived value can lead to more favorable trades.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics**: Being flexible and open to varying trade combinations increases the chances of reaching a consensus. It may be beneficial to compromise on some resources to make the trade more attractive for the other player.\n\n4. **Assessing Need**: Understanding what the other player may need is vital. It can help tailor offers that are more likely to be accepted.\n\n5. **Iterative Offers**: Since the game is iterative, it's important to continuously adapt strategies and offers based on the responses received from other players.\n\n### Current Situation Analysis\n- I currently have:\n  - 14 Wheat (Value: 5)\n  - 20 Wood (Value: 9)\n  - 5 Sheep (Value: 18)\n  - 14 Brick (Value: 30)\n  - 15 Ore (Value: 32)\n\n- The last offer from Player 1 (3 Wheat, 3 Ore for 4 Wood, 2 Sheep) seems to undervalue the resources I'm giving away, as Ore is higher in value than Wood and Sheep. \n\n### Trading Decision\nI need to formulate a counter-offer that aligns better with the values of the resources while still appealing to Player 1's needs.

I can offer something that satisfies their need without undervaluing my resources.\n2. Aim for Wood specifically, as it\u2019s of lower value, to maximize my value gain.\n\n### Final Counter Offer\nI suggest an offer that gives them lower value resources in exchange for higher values.\n\n**Offer**: \n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Ore, 2 Sheep] \nThis aligns with my goal to maximize the value I gain while maintaining certain resources for flexibility in future trades.",

Marginal Values & Gains:\n   - I\u2019d happily trade 3 Wheat (value 15) for 1 Wood (11) because a 5:1 surplus Wheat >>> need for Wood.\n   - 3 Wheat + 3 Ore (value 15+114=129) for 4 Wood + 2 Sheep (44+28=72) is \u201357 value and explains why P0 rejected it. That offer was terrible for me; I over-valued what I was giving.\n\n3. Interpreting P0\u2019s Offers:\n   - P0 keeps trying to dump mid-return items (Sheep/Ore to me; Wheat/Wood to me) while trying to pull my Brick (second-highest value 22). \n   - They appear \u201cSheep & Ore-biased\u201d (value 14,38) and \u201cBrick-starved\u201d.\n\n4. Trade-Worthiness Rules:\n   Only accept trades where my total received value strictly exceeds total surrendered value (strict gain).\n   Same for offers I make: must give the other side at least perceived value parity, but still net myself a gain.\n\n5. Surplus Wheat & Strategic Need:\n   - With 24 Wheat I have 19 units I could trade freely while still retaining 5 for any contingency.\n   - My Wood count is critically low; every extra Wood yields disproportionate utility (marginal utility per unit is highest for Wood then Brick). Therefore Wood should be actively acquired.\n\nDecision:\n\nAccept Player 0\u2019s latest offer: \u201c3 Wheat, 2 Wood offered for 3 Ore, 2 Sheep\u201d\n\nAssess this from MY perspective:\n\n- Me give: 3 Wheat (3\u00d75 = 15) + 2 Wood (2\u00d711 = 22)  \u2192 37 value lost  \n- Me get: 3 Ore (3\u00d738 = 114) + 2 Sheep (2\u00d714 = 28) \u2192 142 value gained  \nNet gain = 142 \u2013 37 = +105.

Scarcity & Marginal Value  \n   \u2013 Each additional unit of a resource you already have is usually worth less than a unit you lack (diminishing marginal utility). Therefore high-quantity resources are the best trade-fodder, low-quantity targets the best gains.  \n\n3. Price Awareness  \n   \u2013 Internal \u201cprices\u201d are fixed at the stated values; external market prices from opponents can diverge. Treat any trade whose unit-price exceeds your internal price as favorable.  \n\n4. Negotiator\u2019s Surplus  \n   \u2013 If you can create surplus for your opponent without hurting yourself, deals are more likely to close. Look for win-win trades (you get a low-quantity, high-value resource while giving up low-value excess).  \n\n5.

      "response": "**Knowledge Generation:**\n\n1. **Resource Value Analysis**: Understanding the value of resources is critical.

Making trades that fulfill another player's needs while offering them excess resources can create a favorable negotiation situation.\n\n3. **Volume vs. Value**: Trading in quantities can be beneficial. Sometimes multiple lower-value resources can be traded for fewer higher-value resources if the other player has a need for them.\n\n4. **Win-Win Approach**: Successful negotiations often create benefit for both parties. Offering trades that enhance both players\u2019 resource setups can lead to better acceptance rates.\n\n5. **Adaptability**: Since trades have been rejected multiple times, one must be ready to adapt their strategy and offerings based on the responses received previously.\n\n**Current Resource Status After the Last Accepted Trade**:\n- Wheat: 11\n- Wood: 18\n- Sheep: 3\n- Brick: 0\n- Ore: 17\n\n**Trading Decision**:\nGiven the current status, I have a surplus of Ore which has a high value (32), and there is a need for Brick (value 30) which can help increase my overall resource advantage.

Objective = move resources only if the **post-trade value** increases, not just symmetry.  \n3. Opponent profile: Player 0 repeatedly tries to get **high-ratio Ore / low-ratio packages** off me; they value Ore > me, and undervalue Brick/Wheat. They **offer 1 good Ore for 2-3 lesser goods**.  \n4. Static stock check:  \n   \u2022 I have excess Brick (17 units), marginal-marginal Wheat (24).  \n   \u2022 Sheep & Wood are both medium, with decent value (14,11).  \n   \u2022 Ore is **scarce vs Player 0\u2019s desire**, so treat it as high-leverage.  \n5.
