Resources can have vastly different values based on scarcity and demand in the game. For instance, Ore has a very high value (37), while Wheat has a lower value (5). Trading off higher-value resources for a better quantity of lower-value resources can help accumulate overall value.\n\n2. **Scarcity and Demand**: Keep track of which resources may be more valuable as the game progresses. If you notice other players are gathering specific resources, those may demand higher trades.\n\n3. **Offer Value Alignment**: When making trade offers, ensure that the resources you are offering are less valuable compared to what you are requesting. A good rule of thumb is to aim for trades that have at least a 1.5 to 2x difference in value favoring the resources you want.\n\n4. **Look for Synergies**: Sometimes, resources work well together. For example, combining Wheat and Brick can help in building or crafting tasks, making them more desirable collectively.\n\n5. **Negotiation and Diplomacy**: Build relationships with other players as favorable trades can emerge from mutual trust and understanding. Avoid aggressive trading that may lead to retaliatory strategies from others.\n\n**Trading Decision:**\n\nEvaluating the situation and considering the values, I will propose the following trade:\n\nI will offer 3 Sheep (total value of 36, as 12 each) and 2 Ore (value of 74) for 5 Brick (value of 110) and 2 Sheep (value of 24).\n\nThis makes a fair trade from a value standpoint, allowing me to acquire more Brick which can be critical for future trades or strategy deployments.\n\n**Action:** \n'[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]'",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \nIn resource-based negotiation games, several key principles apply to optimize value:\n\n1. **Resource Valuation**: Each resource has a fixed individual value. Trading should aim to increase the total net value of one\u2019s inventory. Total value = sum of (quantity \u00d7 value) for each resource.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost**: Before trading, evaluate what you gain versus what you give up. Sacrificing high-value resources should only be done if greater value or strategic advantage is acquired in return.\n\n3. **Net Value Change**: Always calculate the value difference:\n   - Value given = sum of (offered resources \u00d7 their values)\n   - Value received = sum of (requested resources \u00d7 their values)\n   - Aim for positive net value (received > given), unless trading for strategic scarcity or future advantage.\n\n4. **Scarcity and Surplus Management**: Holding excess of a high-value resource may make it a good trade asset, while low-quantity, high-value resources should be conserved unless excellent value is returned.\n\n5. **Trade Efficiency**: Avoid trades that give more than they receive in value, especially when offering high-value items like Ore (value 39) or Sheep (17).\n\nNow, analyze Player 0\u2019s offer:\n- Offered to Player 1: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore  \n- Requested from Player 1: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\n\nCompute value of what Player 1 would receive:  \n3 Sheep \u00d7 17 = 51  \n2 Ore \u00d7 39 = 78  \nTotal received value = 51 + 78 = 129\n\nCompute value of what Player 1 would give up:  \n5 Brick \u00d7 20 = 100  \n2 Sheep \u00d7 17 = 34  \nTotal given value = 100 + 34 = 134\n\nNet value change = 129 (received) - 134 (given) = **-5**\n\nThis trade results in a net loss of 5 value units for Player 1.\n\nAdditionally, Ore is the highest-value resource (39), and giving away 2 units is costly.

In this case, Ore (value 37) is significantly higher than other resources, while Wheat and Wood (values 5 and 10) are lower.\n\n2. **Scarcity and Supply**: The quantity of resources available influences their trade value. If a resource is abundant (like Wheat and Wood), it may not be as valuable in negotiations.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \nIn resource-based negotiation games, maximizing value involves evaluating the relative scarcity, utility, and market value of resources. Key principles include:\n\n1. **Value Asymmetry**: The foundation of successful trades is differing valuations between players. A trade is beneficial only if you value what you receive more than what you give, considering both current needs and future opportunities.\n\n2. **Resource Scarcity and Opportunity Cost**: Rare or high-value resources (e.g., Ore valued at 39) should be traded cautiously. Giving up high-value items for lower-value ones is generally disadvantageous unless strategic positioning compensates.\n\n3. **Net Value Change**: Each trade should be assessed by calculating the net change in total resource value. A positive net gain increases your position.\n\n4. **Redundancy and Surplus**: Resources in excess of immediate use can be profitably traded. Conversely, scarce resources should be retained or acquired.\n\n5. **Trade Efficiency**: Avoid trades that result in net loss or minimal gain, especially when they involve high-value resources.\n\n6. **Strategic Positioning**: Consider not just immediate value, but how resources enable future actions (e.g., building, development).\n\nApplying this to current situation:\n- My current highest-value resource is Ore (value 39), followed by Brick (20), Sheep (17), Wood (11), Wheat (6).\n- I have 12 Ore \u2014 likely scarce and high-opportunity.\n- Brick: 25 \u2014 relatively abundant.\n- Sheep: 17 \u2014 mid-abundant.\n- The previous offer from Player 0:  \n  Offered: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore \u2192 Requested: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep  \n  Net effect for me: -2 Ore, -3 Sheep +5 Brick +2 Sheep \u2192 net: -2 Ore, -1 Sheep, +5 Brick  \n  Value change: -(2\u00d739) - (1\u00d717) + (5\u00d720) = -78 -17 +100 = +5 \u2192 slight gain, but gives up high-value Ore.\n\nI rejected it \u2014 possibly wisely, as giving up Ore is costly and may be needed later.\n\nNew offer:  \nPlayer 0 offers: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood \u2192 Requests: 2 Brick  \nFor me: +2 Wheat, +2 Wood, -2 Brick  \nValue change: +(2\u00d76) + (2\u00d711) - (2\u00d720) = +12 +22 -40 = -6 \u2192 net loss of 6.\n\nThis is a bad trade: I'm giving up high-value Brick (20 each) for low-value returns (Wheat 6, Wood 11).  \nEven though I have many Bricks (25), trading them for lower-value items without gaining strategic advantage reduces total value.\n\nStrategy: Reject disadvantageous offers.

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\n\n1. **Value Assessment**: Understand the values of your resources and your opponent's needs. This is crucial since trading is beneficial when you can secure higher value in exchange for lower-valued items.\n\n2. **Resource Supply and Demand**: Determine what resources are abundant for you and what are scarce for others. Resources that are in higher demand from your opponent can yield better trades.\n\n3. **Strategic Offerings**: When proposing trades, offer combinations that may seem advantageous for the other player while ensuring that your needs are met. Consider both quantity and overall value in your negotiations.\n\n4. **Flexibility and Multiple Proposals**: Be willing to adjust your offers based on the responses from others. If an initial offer is rejected, think about what resources you can afford to trade that may still satisfy both parties.\n\n5. **Trading Goals**: Your main goal should be to increase the total value of your resources. Always evaluate how any trade will move you closer to that goal.\n\n### Trading Decision\n\nAfter assessing Player 1's responses and considering my resources' values, I will make a new trade offer that focuses on what I can give up without significantly impairing my position while appealing to Player 1's potential interest in other resources. I need to be strategic about the quantities and values involved to encourage acceptance.\n\n**New Offer**:\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]\n\n- This offer utilizes resources that I have in excess (Wheat and Wood) while requesting Brick, which seems valuable based on recent acceptance preferences by Player 1.\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds:\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. Resource Valuation and Total Value:\n   - Each resource has a fixed value: Wheat (6), Wood (11), Sheep (17), Brick (20), Ore (39).\n   - The value of any trade should be evaluated by computing the net change in total value of resources.\n   - Always compare the total value of resources given away versus received.\n\n2. Surplus and Scarcity Analysis:\n   - Ore: High value (39), but you have only 12 \u2192 relatively scarce. Trade cautiously.\n   - Brick: High value (20), and you have 25 \u2192 plenty; can be used strategically in trades.\n   - Wheat: Low value (6), you have 22 \u2192 surplus; good to offload for higher-value returns.\n   - Wood: Medium-high value (11), you have 22 \u2192 relatively abundant; potentially useful to trade.\n   - Sheep: High value (17), you have 17 \u2192 moderate stock; valuable in trades.\n\n3. Trade Efficiency:\n   - Aim for trades where the total value received > total value given.\n   - Be cautious of \"break-even\" or negative-value trades, even if they adjust quantities.\n   - Offers that request high-value resources (like Ore) should give high-value returns.\n\n4. Counterparty Patterns:\n   - Player 0 is consistently requesting Brick (high value), offering Wheat, Wood, and sometimes Ore.\n   - They are trying to acquire Brick in bulk, possibly because it's scarce for them.\n   - They have offered Wheat and Wood (lower and medium value) for higher value Brick \u2014 potentially favorable for us if giving excess Brick.\n\n5. Trade Leverage:\n   - Since you have surplus Brick (25), and Brick is in demand, you can use it to acquire underpriced high-value resources.\n   - Avoid trading away Ore unless receiving significant value in return.\n\n6. Past Trade Analysis:\n   - Previous accepted trade: Gave 6 Brick (value: 6\u00d720 = 120), received 1 Ore (39) and 5 Wheat (5\u00d76 = 30) \u2192 total received: 69.\n     - Net loss: 120 - 69 = -51 \u2192 unfavorable. This was a poor trade.\n   - Therefore, be more cautious: ensure value-in >= value-out.\n\n7. Current Offer Evaluation:\n   - Incoming offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood \u2192 3 Brick\n     - Value given by you: 3 Brick \u00d7 20 = 60\n     - Value received: 4 Wheat \u00d7 6 = 24; 2 Wood \u00d7 11 = 22 \u2192 total 46\n     - Net change: 46 - 60 = -14 \u2192 value loss\n   - This trade reduces your total resource value.\n\n8. Strategic Implication:\n   - You should not accept a trade that results in net value loss unless it corrects a critical surplus or serves a future goal (e.g., setting up a combo).\n   - Here, Brick is in surplus, but trading it must still return fair value.\n   - Since this offer undervalues your Brick and you already have sufficient Wheat and Wood, no strategic benefit outweighs the loss.\n\nDecision:\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge:\n1. **Resource Value Evaluation**: Each resource has a different value, which can fluctuate based on demand. Understanding the relative value helps in formulating competitive offers.\n2. **Scarcity and Abundance**: Resources that are abundant for you but scarce for others can be used to your advantage in negotiations. For instance, if a certain resource is readily available to you but not to other players, it may justify a higher trade value.\n3. **Mutual Benefit**: Successful negotiations should aim for win-win situations. Trade offers should be framed to illustrate how both parties benefit, making it more likely for the other player to accept.\n4. **Incremental Trading**: Makes smaller offers to gauge interest or establish a baseline for negotiation. It can lead to eventual acceptance of larger trades.\n5. **Observation of Trading Patterns**: After observing how Player 1 has responded to trades, understand their preferences and how desperate they appear for different resources to adjust future offers accordingly.\n\n### Current Resources After Trades:\n- Wheat: 23 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 23 (Value: 10)\n- Sheep: 20 (Value: 12)\n- Brick: 26 (Value: 22)\n- Ore: 3 (Value: 37)\n\n### Trading Decision:\nTo improve the total value of my resources, I want to assess what resources Player 1 may need. Given that they rejected the previous trades focused on bricks, it may be more strategic to shift my offer to focus on resources they may need more. Since Player 1 did not accept the sheep or brick as requested, I suggest an offer involving wood or wheat, both of which I have in abundance. \n\nLet\u2019s formulate a new offer:\n- I will offer 5 Wood and 2 Wheat in exchange for 4 Sheep. \n\nThis trades resources that I have in excess, potentially appealing to Player 1\u2019s needs for sheep while I build up my brick quantity.\n\n### Final Trade Offer:\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 4 Sheep]",
