      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Value Maximization**: The goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Therefore, every trade should aim to receive resources with higher total value than those given, or at least align with a strategy of improving future trade efficiency or enabling high-value conversions (e.g., for building development cards or settlements in a broader context, though not explicitly stated here).\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost & Scarcity**: Resources with higher individual value (Ore at 40, Brick at 29) are more valuable. Giving them up should be compensated with equal or greater value. Ore is both high-value and high-quantity (22), which may make it a powerful bargaining chip, but also risky to deplete if it limits future gains.\n\n3. **Abundance vs. Need**: I have surplus Wheat (18), Sheep (18), and Ore (22), which could be used in trades. Wood is relatively low in quantity (10) and of medium value (9), so acquiring more Wood might be beneficial, though not at excessive cost.\n\n4. **Trade Efficiency**: A good trade increases total inventory value or improves flexibility. Since all values are static, the focus is on net value gain. For example, trading 3 Sheep (3\u00d715=45) and 2 Ore (2\u00d740=80), total 125, for 5 Brick (5\u00d729=145) and 2 Sheep (2\u00d715=30), total 175, would yield a net gain of 50 \u2014 highly favorable.\n\n5. **Avoid Circular or Redundant Trades**: Giving Sheep to get Sheep is inefficient unless net value gain occurs. But getting higher-value resources (like Brick or Ore) in return for lower-value ones (like Wheat or Wood) is ideal.\n\n6. **Strategic Timing**: Over 10 turns, early trades can compound gains. Holding high-value resources may allow better negotiation leverage later, but surplus lower-opportunity-cost resources (e.g., Wheat) can be traded early.\n\n7. **Asymmetric Valuations**: Other players may value resources differently. I can exploit this by offering resources I have in surplus that they may value more, such as Sheep or Wheat, in exchange for high-value resources like Ore or Brick.\n\n8. **Marginal Value Principle**: The more of a resource I have, the lower its marginal value to me. With 22 Ore, each additional Ore is less useful \u2014 I should consider trading surplus Ore for undervalued (by others) but useful resources.\n\n9. **Avoid Over-Trading Out Critical Resources**: Even with high quantities, depleting Ore too much may reduce future negotiating power, since it's the highest-value resource.\n\n10. **Initiative in Offers**: Since no incoming offer is present, I should make a strategic offer to maximize value using my surplus.\n\nGiven my surplus in Sheep (18) and Ore (22), but also relatively high value of these, I must balance. However, Brick is also high-value (29) and I already have 15 \u2014 acquiring more at a profit is good if possible.\n\nOptimal strategy: Offer a combination of mid-value surplus (Sheep, Wheat) to acquire high-value Brick or Ore.\n\nBut note: I already have high Ore \u2014 maybe target Brick, which is valuable and slightly lower stock than Ore.\n\nLet me construct an offer with positive net value gain.\n\nExample:  \nOffer: 3 Sheep (3\u00d715=45) and 5 Wheat (5\u00d75=25) \u2192 total 70  \nRequest: 3 Brick (3\u00d729=87) \u2192 profit of 17 value units.\n\nAlternatively, target Wood if undervalued, but Wood is only value 9 \u2014 not ideal unless in a package.\n\nBetter: Use Sheep and Wheat surplus to get Brick.\n\nBut another idea: Perhaps another player needs Sheep for development cards? Use that.\n\nI propose:\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood]  \nValue out: 5\u00d715 + 3\u00d75 = 75 + 15 = 90  \nValue in: 3\u00d729 + 1\u00d79 = 87 + 9 = 96 \u2192 net +6\n\nAcceptable, but let's do better.\n\nAlternative:  \n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 4 Wheat -> 4 Brick]  \nOut: 4\u00d715 + 4\u00d75 = 60 + 20 = 80  \nIn: 4\u00d729 = 116 \u2192 gain 36 \u2014 very good.\n\nBut will another player accept giving 4 Brick for that?\n\nPerhaps too optimistic.\n\nAdjust: Offer more value.\n\nBut I want to gain, not break even.\n\nUse the most favorable example from earlier:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]  \nWait \u2014 this gives 3 Sheep and 2 Ore (value 45 + 80 = 125)  \nReceives 5 Brick and 2 Sheep (145 + 30 = 175) \u2192 gain of 50\n\nBut I get back 2 Sheep\u2014so net Sheep out: 1  \nOre out: 2  \nBrick in: 5\n\nStill, net resource change: +5 Brick, -1 Sheep, -2 Ore \u2192 total value change: +145 -15 -80 = +50\n\nVery favorable.\n\nBut why would another player give me 5 Brick for only 3 Sheep and 2 Ore when they are losing value?\n\nAlternatively, reverse perspective: maybe someone has excess Brick and needs Ore, which is high value.\n\nBut I already have a lot of Ore \u2014 trading a little may be worthwhile for large Brick gain.\n\nBut such an offer seems too good to be true \u2014 likely to be denied.\n\nBetter: make a balanced or slightly favorable offer that is more likely to be accepted.\n\nReassess.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep (18). Value 15. Good to trade.\n\nBrick value 29 \u2014 high. Want more.\n\nWood is low (10), value 9 \u2014 could use more.\n\nOre high, but valuable \u2014 trade sparingly.\n\nSo: offer Sheep and Wheat for Brick and Wood.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 6 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 2 Wood]  \nOut: 4\u00d715=60, 6\u00d75=30 \u2192 90  \nIn: 3\u00d729=87, 2\u00d79=18 \u2192 105 \u2192 gain 15\n\nStill good.\n\nBut let's make it more attractive to the other player.\n\nWait \u2014 goal is to increase *my* value, not theirs. But offer must be acceptable enough to possibly be accepted.\n\nBest: make an offer where the other player perceives value or has different abundance.\n\nBut no information \u2014 so aim for slight advantage with plausible desirability.\n\nAnother idea: trade Ore for Brick, but I have a lot of Ore.\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick]  \nOut: 80 + 30 = 110  \nIn: 87 \u2192 I lose 23 \u2014 bad.\n\nNo.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Wood]  \nOut: 25 + 30 = 55  \nIn: 58 + 9 = 67 \u2192 gain 12 \u2014 good.\n\nBut maybe too conservative.\n\nBetter offer:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 4 Brick]  \nOut: 45 + 25 = 70  \nIn: 116 \u2192 gain 46 \u2014 excellent if accepted.\n\nIs 4 Brick worth that to another player? Maybe not \u2014 because they lose value.\n\nBut if they are flush with Brick and need Sheep or Wheat for development, yes.\n\nGiven that Sheep are used in many trades, this could be realistic.\n\nAlternatively, accept that I should receive a mix.\n\nBut let's go for high value.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 5 Wheat -> 4 Brick]",

I have a lot of Wheat and Brick, and a decent amount of Sheep. My Wood and Ore are scarcer.\n    *   Consider the other player's likely needs or surpluses. Since they are offering Wheat and Sheep, they might have a surplus of these or need Brick and Wood.\n\nApplying Knowledge:\nPlayer 0's offer is 5 Sheep (65), 3 Wheat (15) -> 3 Brick (81), 1 Wood (12).\nMy perspective: Give 3 Brick (81) + 1 Wood (12) = 93. Receive 5 Sheep (65) + 3 Wheat (15) = 80.\nThis is a net loss of 13 value for me. I will not accept it.\nI need to counter-offer to make this favourable for me.\nPlayer 0 seems to want Brick and Wood. I have a lot of Brick. I have less Wood.\nI want to get rid of my lower value resources (Wheat, Sheep) for higher value resources (Ore, Brick, but I have a lot of Brick already).\nLet's try to improve the offer to make it positive for me.\nThe original offer is MINE: 3 Brick (81), 1 Wood (12) = 93. THEIRS: 5 Sheep (65), 3 Wheat (15) = 80.\nTo make it profitable for me, I need my received value > my given value.\nIf I give 3 Brick, 1 Wood (93 value), I need to receive more than 93 value. Receiving 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat (80 value) is not enough.\nPerhaps I can give less, or request more.\nPlayer 0 needs Brick and Wood. I have 22 Brick and 8 Wood.\nLet's try to adjust the quantities slightly to make it positive.\nConsider asking for 1 Ore instead of some Sheep/Wheat. Ore is high value.\nAlternative: Give 2 Brick (54) + 1 Wood (12) = 66. Request 5 Sheep (65). This is 65 (received) vs 66 (given) - still slightly negative.\nLet's offer to give a little less Brick or Wood (if I'm giving them) or ask for more of what they're offering.\nIf I give less (say, 2 Brick, 1 Wood = 66) but still get 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat (80). This would be +14 for me.\nSo my offer: I give 2 Brick, 1 Wood. I receive 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat.\nThis would mean original:\nP1 gives (3 Brick, 1 Wood) = 93. P1 receives (5 Sheep, 3 Wheat) = 80. My loss 13.\nMy counter:\nP1 gives (2 Brick, 1 Wood) = 66. P1 receives (5 Sheep, 3 Wheat) = 80.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This means any trade must result in a net positive value gain for me.\n2.  **Current Resources and Values:** I have varying quantities and values. My most valuable resources per unit are Ore (32) and Brick (27). My least valuable are Wheat (5) and Wood (12). Sheep is mid-range (13).\n3.  **Identify Surplus/Deficit:** I have large quantities of Wheat (24), Brick (22), and Sheep (11). I have fewer Wood (8) and Ore (8). While having many of a low-value item (Wheat) is a surplus, having many of a high-value item (Brick) is not necessarily a surplus if I can still gain value by trading it for something even more valuable.\n4.  **Prioritize High-Value Acquisition:** My goal is to acquire more high-value resources (Ore, Brick) or trade low-value resources for higher-value ones.\n5.  **Evaluate Opponent's Needs (Inferred):** Player 0 just offered 5 Sheep (value 65) and 3 Wheat (value 15) for 3 Brick (value 81) and 1 Wood (value 12).\n    *   Player 0 offered: Total Value 80 (Sheep + Wheat)\n    *   Player 0 requested: Total Value 93 (Brick + Wood)\n    *   This implies Player 0 valued Brick and Wood more than Sheep and Wheat in that specific exchange. They *wanted* Brick and Wood, and were willing to give up Sheep and Wheat.\n    *   Their offer was a *loss* for them if accepted (80 value given, 93 value received from my perspective, meaning 93 value given by them, 80 value received by them). This seems like a calculation error on their part if they were trying to gain value, or they have a specific need overriding pure value. *Correction*: No, Player 0's offer: \"Offered items: 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> Requested items: 3 Brick, 1 Wood\". This means they *give* Sheep/Wheat and *get* Brick/Wood. So they are giving up 80 value (5*13 + 3*5) to get 93 value (3*27 + 1*12). This is a net gain of 13 value for them. They clearly want Brick and Wood.\n6.  **My Last Offer:** My last offer was \"2 Brick, 1 Wood -> 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat\".\n    *   I offered: Value 66 (2*27 + 1*12)\n    *   I requested: Value 80 (5*13 + 3*5)\n    *   This offer was a gain of 14 value for *me* if accepted (80 received, 66 given). Player 0 rejected it, likely because it was a loss for them (giving 80, getting 66).\n7.  **Finding a Mutually Beneficial Trade Space:** Player 0 wants Brick and Wood. I want to increase my value. If I trade Brick and Wood, I must receive *more* value than I give. Player 0 previously wanted 3 Brick and 1 Wood (total value 93). I have 22 Brick and 8 Wood. I can afford to trade some of these, but only if the exchange is favorable.\n8.  **Leverage Knowledge of Opponent's Needs:** Since Player 0 rejected an offer where they would lose value, I need to propose an offer where *they* also gain value, or at least break even, while I gain value. This is the core of negotiation.\n9.  **Evaluate Resource Ratios:**\n    *   Wheat: 5\n    *   Wood: 12 (approx 2.4 Wheat)\n    *   Sheep: 13 (approx 2.6 Wheat, approx 1.1 Wood)\n    *   Brick: 27 (approx 5.4 Wheat, approx 2.25 Wood, approx 2.1 Sheep)\n    *   Ore: 32 (approx 6.4 Wheat, approx 2.6 Wood, approx 2.4 Sheep, approx 1.18 Brick)\n    *   Trading low-value for high-value is key. For example, trading Wheat or Wood for Brick or Ore.\n10. **Consider Small Incremental Trades vs. Large Trades:** Since the last two offers were rejected, maybe a smaller, more balanced offer is needed, or one that directly addresses Player 0's implied desire for Brick and Wood but at a more equitable rate.\n11. **Player 0 made no new offer.** This means it's my turn to initiate. I should respond to their past expressed interest.\n\nDecision:\nPlayer 0 wants Brick and Wood. I have a good quantity of Brick. I can give them Brick if I get something significantly more valuable or get enough quantity of other resources to make a larger future trade. My current low-value resources are Wheat and Wood. My high-value resources are Brick and Ore. I want more Ore.\n\nPlayer 0's last rejected offer from me was 2 Brick, 1 Wood (value 66) for 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat (value 80). Player 0 rejected this because they lost 14 value.\nPlayer 0's original offer was 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat (value 80) for 3 Brick, 1 Wood (value 93). Player 0 would gain 13 value. I rejected this. *Correction:* The instructions specified \"Player 1 rejected the trade offer.\" of \"5 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood\". My value calculation of Player 0's offer: I *receive* 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat (value 80). I *give* 3 Brick, 1 Wood (value 93). This is a loss of 13 value for *me*. So, I was correct to reject it.\n\nGiven Player 0 wants Brick and Wood, and my goal is to gain value (ideally Ore), perhaps I can offer Brick but for something valuable like Ore. However, Player 0 hasn't signalled an interest in giving Ore. They have signaled interest in giving Sheep and Wheat.\n\nLet's try to find a trade that might be profitable for me and *less* painful for Player 0 (or even profitable for both if possible). Player 0 wanted 3 Brick, 1 Wood for 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat. Let's try to adjust the ratios.\n\nWhat if I offer a smaller quantity of Brick, for their Sheep/Wheat, but at a more favorable ratio for me?\nOr, what if I try to offload some of my high quantity/low value Wheat?\n\nI have 24 Wheat (Value 5). I have 22 Brick (Value 27). Brick is 5.4 times more valuable than Wheat.\nLet's propose trading some low-value Wheat for some of Player 0's Sheep.\nPlayer 0 offered 5 Sheep (value 65) for 3 Brick, 1 Wood (value 93). This implied they heavily desired Brick/Wood.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore or more Brick. I have plenty of Brick so I should try to trade my lower value items for higher value items.\nWhat if I try to trade Wheat for Brick? Player 0 seems to want Brick.\nIf I offer 10 Wheat (value 50) for 1 Brick (value 27). This is a bad trade for me.\n\nMy goal is to increase value. I have plenty of Wheat and a good amount of Sheep. I want more valuable items like Ore.\nLet's try to acquire Ore by using my quantities of Wheat or Sheep.\nI don't know Player 0's resources, only their stated offers.\n\nSince Player 0 wants Brick, let's offer them a slightly adjusted deal where they still get Brick, but I also get more value.\nPerhaps I can offer a combination of lower value items (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) for Brick or Ore from them.\nOr, trade Brick *from my surplus* for other valuable items.\n\nLet's look at my resources:\n[Wheat] Qty: 24 Value: 5 (Total 120)\n[Wood] Qty: 8 Value: 12 (Total 96)\n[Sheep] Qty: 11 Value: 13 (Total 143)\n[Brick] Qty: 22 Value: 27 (Total 594)\n[Ore] Qty: 8 Value: 32 (Total 256)\nTotal perceived value: 1209\n\nPlayer 0 offered 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat (80 value) for 3 Brick, 1 Wood (93 value). I rejected this as it was a -13 value trade for me.\nMy counter offer was 2 Brick, 1 Wood (66 value) for 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat (80 value). Player 0 rejected this as it was a -14 value trade for them.\n\nThe difference in perceived value for both parties is too large. Player 0 still signaled a strong desire for Brick.\nI have a lot of Brick. What if I offer Brick at a rate that's slightly favorable to me, but not too penalizing for Player 0, especially if they desperately need it?\n\nLet's try to trade Brick for Ore or a lot of Sheep.\nIf I offer 1 Brick (27) for 2 Sheep (26), it's a slight loss for me.\nIf I offer 1 Brick (27) for 3 Wood (36), it's a gain for me. However, I have enough Wood.\n\nLet's consider a trade where Player 0 gets Brick and I get high value for it.\nMy Brick (27) vs Player 0's Sheep (13) or Wheat (5).\n1 Brick for 2 Sheep (26) is close.\n1 Brick for 5 Wheat (25) is close.\n\nWhat if Player 0 needs Brick more than anything? I can leverage that.\nOffer: 1 Brick (27) for 1 Ore (32). Good for me (+5). But Player 0 didn't offer Ore.\n\nLet's try to re-engage with Player 0's stated interest in Brick, but at a more even exchange, perhaps even slightly beneficial to them, in the hope that it opens up future better trades, or allows me to offload excess.\nIf Player 0 is giving 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat (value 80), and wants 3 Brick, 1 Wood (value 93).\nTheir offer: Give 80, Get 93 (Gain 13)\n\nMy rejected counter: Give 2 Brick, 1 Wood (66); Get 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat (80). I gave too little; they lost 14 value.\n\nHow about a trade where both *could* gain slightly, or at least one is flat and the other gains, to get the ball rolling.\nTheir desire is 3 Brick, 1 Wood.\nWhat if I offered 2 Brick for 4 Sheep?\nMy give: 2 Brick (54)\nMy get: 4 Sheep (52) -> Loss of 2. Not good.\n\nWhat if I offer a smaller amount of Brick for a more balanced quantity of Sheep/Wheat?\nI have 22 Brick. I can spare some.\nMaybe 1 Brick (27) for 2 Sheep (26) + 1 Wheat (5)? Total 31. This is a gain of 4 for me.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat]\nMy gain: (2*13 + 1*5) - (1*27) = 31 - 27 = +4. This seems like a reasonable offer. It is a smaller sum than the previous rejected large offers. Player 0 gets Brick, which they explicitly wanted.\n\nLet's re-evaluate their desire. Player 0 wanted a lot of Brick (3) and a bit of Wood (1).\nIf I give 1 Brick, it's 27 value. If they give me 2 Sheep and 1 Wheat, it's 31 value.\nThis is a positive value trade for me. It's a negative value trade for them (-4). They will likely reject it.\n\nI need to offer something where Player 0 also *gains* or at least breaks even to facilitate a trade.\nLet's consider their original desired items: 3 Brick (81), 1 Wood (12), for a total of 93 value.\nThey offered: 5 Sheep (65), 3 Wheat (15) for a total of 80 value.\n\nPlayer 0 wants value 93 and offers value 80. So they are *attempting* to gain 13 value.\nI rejected it because I would give 93 and get 80, a loss of 13 value.\n\nI offered to give 66 value and get 80 value, for a gain of 14 value. Player 0 rejected it because they would give 80 and get 66, a loss of 14 value.\n\nThe offers are currently mirrored losses for the other party. I need an offer where *both* sides gain or at least one side gains and the other is neutral.\n\nWhat if I reduce the quantity of Brick they *give* me a lot compared to what they *want* from me, but I make it a value-neutral trade for them?\nLet's try to get Ore. Ore is my highest value item.\nI have 8 Ore. My goal is to get more Ore.\nWhat if I gave 2 Brick (54) for 1 Ore (32) and 2 Wheat (10)? Total 42. Bad for me.\n\nI need to trade my abundant, low-value items. Wheat (24) is my most abundant, lowest value item.\nCan I trade 10 Wheat (50) for 1 Brick (27)? Bad for me.\n\nThe simplest approach now might be to make a small, genuinely mutually beneficial trade or one that is balanced, to establish a trading relationship and gain a slight edge.\nLet's try a trade for Ore, as it's my highest value.\nIf I give 2 Sheep (26) and 2 Wheat (10) for 1 Ore (32).\nMy give: 36 value. My get: 32 value. Loss of 4. Bad trade.\n\nI have ample Brick. What if I use some Brick to get Ore?\nWhat if I give 1 Brick (27) for 1 Ore (32)?\nMy Give: 27. My Get: 32. Gain: +5.\nThis is a positive trade for me. What about from Player 0's perspective? They would be giving their most valuable resource (if they have it), for a resource that's less valuable for them. This is unlikely to be accepted if they apply the same valuation.\n\nGiven Player 0's demonstrated interest in Brick, let's make an offer on Brick that allows *them* to gain value, but still allows me to offload surplus or get something else useful.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (81) for 5 Sheep (65) and 3 Wheat (15)? This is the reverse of Player 0's original offer.\nA trade of 3 Brick, 1 Wood (93 value for them) for 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat (80 value for them). Player 0 wanted to give 80 and receive 93. So they wanted to gain 13 value.\nI rejected it because I would give 93 and receive 80, a loss of 13 value.\n\nHow about I offer 2 Brick (54 value) for 4 Sheep (52 value) and 1 Wood (12 value).\nMy give: 2 Brick (54)\nMy get: 4 Sheep (52) + 1 Wood (12) = 64.\nMy gain: +10.\nWhat about Player 0? They would give 64 value (4 Sheep, 1 Wood) and get 54 value (2 Brick).\nPlayer 0 would lose 10 value. They would likely reject this.\n\nI need to offer a trade where Player 0 also benefits.\nLet's make a trade where Player 0 receives slightly more value than they give, and I still receive slightly more value than I give. This is only possible if there's a difference in valuation (which there isn't, based on the fixed resource values), or if one player is willing to break even to offload resources.\n\nLet's consider trading my Wheat (low value, high quantity) for whatever other resources Player 0 might give.\nWhat if I give 5 Wheat (25) for 1 Sheep (13) + 1 Wood (12)?\nMy give: 25. My get: 25. Net 0.\nThis helps me consolidate low-value Wheat into fewer pieces of other low-value items. It slightly reduces my quantity of items. Is this good? Only if it allows future, more profitable trades. This is neutral for me. What about for Player 0? If they have a surplus of Sheep or Wood, and a deficit of Wheat, it could be appealing. They didn't signal this.\n\nLet's reconsider Player 0's strong want for Brick.\nWhat if I offer a trade where Player 0 clearly gains some Brick, and I get something else valuable, even if less than a 1:1 value exchange, but it moves inefficient resources?\n\nConsider a trade that is approximately even in value for both parties, but results in me receiving more valuable items (like Ore) or reducing quantities of my least valuable (Wheat).\nTheir original offer was to give 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat (80 value) for 3 Brick, 1 Wood (93 value). Player 0 wanted to gain 13 value and I would lose 13 value.\nMy goal is to gain value.\n\nLet's assume Player 0 is strictly looking for positive value trades.\nIf I offer 1 Brick (27) for 2 Sheep (26). This is -1 for me. Bad.\nIf I offer 1 Brick (27) for 3 Wood (36). This is +9 for me. Player 0 would give 36, get 27, lose 9. They might reject.\nBut Player 0 indicated they *wanted* Wood from me. So perhaps they have a high internal value for Wood.\n\nWhat if I offer: [2 Wood -> 1 Brick]?\nMy give: 2 Wood (24)\nMy get: 1 Brick (27)\nMy gain: +3.\nPlayer 0's perspective: They get 1 Brick (27 value) from me, they give 2 Wood (24 value). They gain +3 value.\nThis is a *positive value trade for both players*. This is the ideal scenario for a negotiation. Player 0 also expressed a desire for Wood (in their earlier requested items, 3 Brick and 1 Wood), which is contradictory if they have a surplus of Wood to give.\nHowever, if they have an abundant amount of Wood and really need Brick, this could work.\nThis trade is low quantity, which might be a good way to test the waters after two rejected offers.\n\nCurrent Resources:\n+ [Wheat] Qty: 24 Value: 5\n+ [Wood] Qty: 8 Value: 12\n+ [Sheep] Qty: 11 Value: 13\n+ [Brick] Qty: 22 Value: 27\n+ [Ore] Qty: 8 Value: 32\n\nProposed: [Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]\nThis reduces my Wood to 6. Increases my Brick to 23.\nValue change for me: +3.\nValue change for Player 0: +3.\nThis is a small, mutually beneficial trade, leveraging Player 0's stated interest in Brick, and my desire to gain value. The only potential issue is that Player 0 previously *requested* Wood, so them *offering* Wood might be contradictory to their \"needs\". However, sometimes players have internal resource goals irrespective of simple value. They might have a specific building plan that requires X amount of Wood, and they have an abundance of it. Or perhaps their previous offer was for *me* to give Wood, not for them to receive it, so my interpretation of \"Player 0 valued Brick and Wood more than Sheep and Wheat\" might mean they desired Wood to complete something.\n\nLet's re-read Player 0's original offer: \"[Offered items: 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> Requested items: 3 Brick, 1 Wood]\". This means they wanted to *receive* 3 Brick and 1 Wood. So they *wanted* Wood. My proposed offer of me *receiving* Brick but *offering* Wood implies Player 0 *gives* Wood. This is the opposite of them wanting Wood. This would mean they would be giving up something they want.\n\nOkay, let's assume Player 0 still wants Brick and Wood from *me*.\nAnd I want to offload Wheat or Sheep, and get Ore or Brick.\n\nGiven my abundance of Brick, and Player 0's desire for Brick, I should try to trade Brick for something high value.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (81) for 2 Ore (64) and 1 Wood (12). Total 76. Bad for me.\n\nThe negotiation is stuck because the other player wants to exploit me, and I refuse. I need to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me, but also understandable why Player 0 might accept.\nPlayer 0 explicitly offered to give 5 Sheep (65), 3 Wheat (15) for a total of 80 value.\nThey wanted 3 Brick (81), 1 Wood (12) for a total of 93 value.\n\nWhat if I target the Wheat they want to give? I have 24 Wheat.\nWhat if I offer: 10 Wheat (50) for 1 Brick (27) and 1 Wood (12). Total 39. Bad for me.\n\nLet's make an offer that leverages my surplus of Brick, but extracts a clear value gain for me, and isn't *too* much of a loss for Player 0.\nPlayer 0 wants Brick. I have 22 Brick.\nWhat if I offer: 2 Brick (54) -> 1 Ore (32) + 2 Sheep (26)?\nMy give: 54. My get: 58. My gain: +4.\nPlayer 0's perspective: Give 58, Get 54. Loss: -4. They will likely reject.\n\nLet's try to focus on trading away my high quantity, low value items for something better, while giving Player 0 something they actively want (Brick).\nIf I give up low value resource (Wheat, Wood, Sheep), I want a high value resource (Brick, Ore).\nIf I give up high value resource (Brick, Ore), I want an even higher value in return.\n\nLet's go back to Player 0's rejection of my offer and their initial stated needs.\nTheir initial request (3 Brick, 1 Wood) implies high value or strong need for Brick/Wood.\nMy previous counter-offer: 2 Brick, 1 Wood (66 value) -> 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat (80 value). I wanted to gain 14. They would lose 14. This was too greedy.\n\nTo make a trade happen, I need to reduce my gain, or increase their perceived gain from their side.\nIf Player 0 is looking for 3 Brick and 1 Wood.\nWhat if I give Player 0 *less* Brick than they need, but for a good deal for me?\nOr give them *some* Brick, and they give me a mix of stuff, from which I derive net value.\n\nLet's offer a trade where the requested resources match the \"given\" resource value, perhaps with a slight edge to me.\nPlayer 0 wanted: 3 Brick (81), 1 Wood (12) = 93.\nThey offered: 5 Sheep (65), 3 Wheat (15) = 80.\nThe difference they wanted was 13 value.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (27) for 2 Wheat (10) and 2 Wood (24)? Value 34. This is a gain of 7 for me.\nPlayer 0 would give 34 value, get 27 value. Loss of 7. Rejected.\n\nI need to craft an offer that Player 0 might accept. They want Brick.\nLet's try to offer 1 Brick and get a mix of their stuff that's only slightly higher value.\nOffer: 1 Brick -> 1 Sheep, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat\nMy give: 1 Brick (27)\nMy get: 1 Sheep (13) + 1 Wood (12) + 1 Wheat (5) = 30.\nMy gain: +3.\nPlayer 0's perspective: Give 30, Get 27. Loss of 3. Still a loss for them.\n\nLet's make an offer that results in a net-zero or even a slight gain FOR THEM, while still letting me consolidate or offload high quantities.\nIf I want to get rid of Wheat, what can I get for it?\nWhat if I offer 5 Wheat (25) for 1 Sheep (13) + 1 Wood (12). This is a 0 value change for me (25 for 25).\nPlayer 0 gives 1 Sheep, 1 Wood (25). Gets 5 Wheat (25). This is 0 for them too.\nThis is a completely value-neutral trade for both players. This might be accepted if Player 0 needs to offload Sheep or Wood, or simply needs Wheat. But it doesn't increase my *total* value. It just changes the composition of my resources. It reduces my highest quantity item.\n\nThis is a strategy: Proposing a truly fair (value-neutral) trade to build trust or re-engage, then follow up with value-gaining trades.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep, 1 Wood]\n\nWhat if I target *acquiring* Ore specifically because it's valuable.\nCan I trade 1 Brick (27) + 1 Wheat (5) for 1 Ore (32)?\nMy give: 32. My get: 32. Net 0.\nThis helps me change composition from a low value item (Wheat) and an ample item (Brick) to a high value item (Ore).\nPlayer 0 would give 1 Ore (32) and get 1 Brick, 1 Wheat (32). Net 0 for them.\nThis is a neutral trade for both. Player 0 gets Brick, which they wanted. I get Ore, which I want. This seems like the *best* next move. It explicitly ties into Player 0's stated desire for Brick, while allowing me to gain a highly desirable unit (Ore) without losing value.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis consumes 1 Brick (was 22, now 21) and 1 Wheat (was 24, now 23).\nIt adds 1 Ore (was 8, now 9).\nTotal value change: +0 for me.\n\nMy primary objective is increasing total value.\nA neutral trade doesn't achieve my primary objective directly. However, it converts a low-value resource (Wheat) and a plentiful resource (Brick) into a high-value resource (Ore). This can improve my position for future trades, or for potential game-end scoring if the individual value of resources matters more than raw quantity. If I need a specific resource for a project, this type of trade is excellent. But my current goal is total value *increase*.\n\nSo I need to ensure a net positive for me.\nLet's try to get +5 value for me, which seems like a small profit margin.\nIf I offer: 1 Brick (27) + 1 Wheat (5) = 32. I want 37 value back.\nCan I get 1 Ore (32) and something else small? Like 1 Wheat (5)? No, they probably don't want to give Wheat.\n1 Ore (32) + 1/2 Sheep (would need to be 1 Sheep = 13).\nThis doesn't seem easy if they are also aiming for positive trades.\n\nLet's rethink: My total value is 1209. I need to increase this.\nPlayer 0 wants Brick and Wood. I have 22 Brick and 8 Wood.\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (27) for 3 Sheep (39)?\nMy give: 27. My get: 39. My gain: +12.\nPlayer 0 gives 39, gets 27. Loss of 12. They would reject this.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (27) for 2 Sheep (26) and 1 Wheat (5)? Total 31.\nMy gain: +4.\nPlayer 0's loss: -4. They would mostly reject.\n\nThe challenge is when both players are rational and want to gain value, they clash unless there is a difference in resource perception, or one offers a \"loss\" trade for other reasons (e.g., getting rid of surplus quickly).\n\nI have a lot of Wheat (24). Let's use Wheat aggressively to gain value.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (25) for 1 Brick (27)\nMy give: 25. My get: 27. My gain: +2.\nPlayer 0: Gives 27, Gets 25. Loss of 2. They will reject. But maybe they *really* need Wheat.\n\nSince Player 0 rejected my last value-gain offer (14 value), I need to propose one with less gain for me, or one that has a smaller loss for them, hoping they accept given their desire for certain resources.\n\nLet's try a very small value gain for me, but using my large quantities.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 4 Sheep]\nMy give: 10 Wheat (50)\nMy get: 4 Sheep (52)\nMy gain: +2.\nPlayer 0 perspective: Give 52, Get 50. Loss of 2. They will reject.\n\nI need to make an offer that is profitable for me AND for them, or at least break even for them.\nThe only way for both to profit is if there's an implicit hidden value or specific project goal that makes a resource more valuable for one than its base value.\n\nGiven Player 0's persistence in wanting Brick, I will focus on trading away Brick.\nLet's make a clear profit for me.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]\nMy give: 1 Brick (27)\nMy get: 1 Ore (32)\nMy gain: +5.\nThis means Player 0 will lose 5 value. This is a common sticking point. This is like me asking Player 0 to give their highest value item (Ore) for a lower value item (Brick). They offered to take Brick earlier, but not necessarily give Ore for it.\n\nI will try the [Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore] option, as it is value neutral for *both* sides, and gets me a valuable Ore that I can use in the future. While it doesn't directly increase my total value, it changes the composition in my favor, and builds a trading relationship.\nThis is a risky choice, as the goal is value *increase*. However, repeated rejections mean the current negotiation strategy isn't working if both players are rational. A neutral trade could break the deadlock.\n\nLet's think for a profitable trade carefully. I must get more value than I give.\nPlayer 0 tried to get 3 Brick, 1 Wood (93 value). They offered 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat (80 value).\nI rejected this.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (27) for 1 Ore (32) and 1 Wheat (5)? My get: 37. My give: 27. Gain: +10.\nPlayer 0 gives 37, gets 27. Loss of 10. They will reject.\n\nI will try a trade that is value positive *for me*, and *neutral* for Player 0, by using their desire for Brick.\nPlayer 0 wants Brick.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (39) for 1 Brick (27) + 1 Wood (12). Get 39, Give 39. Net 0.\nMy give: 3 Sheep (39)\nMy get: 1 Brick (27) + 1 Wood (12) = 39.\nMy gain: +0.\nPlayer 0's perspective: Gives 1 Brick, 1 Wood (39 value). Gets 3 Sheep (39 value). Net 0.\nThis is a neutral trade for both.\nThis is excellent for me because I have 11 Sheep, so it reduces a mid-value item, and gains me valuable Brick (my top priority along with Ore). It also gives Player 0 Brick.\n\nSo, this option:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick, 1 Wood]\nMy current resources: 24 Wheat, 8 Wood, 11 Sheep, 22 Brick, 8 Ore\nAfter trade if accepted: 24 Wheat, 9 Wood, 8 Sheep, 23 Brick, 8 Ore\nValue change: From 11*13 = 143 to 8*13=104 (give 39)\nFrom 22*27 = 594 to 23*27=621 (get 27)\nFrom 8*12 = 96 to 9*12=108 (get 12)\nTotal value change for me: -39 + 27 + 12 = 0.\n\nStill a 0 value trade for me based on the fixed valuations. This doesn't meet the \"increase total value\" objective directly.\nThe goal is to increase my *total value*.\n\nI need a trade where my `value received > value given`.\nI need to be profitable. Player 0 also wants to be profitable. This is the core issue.\nThe only way a trade can increase value for both is if there's a difference in their *personal valuation* from the fixed value, which isn't modeled.\n\nTherefore, I must insist on value gain for me, knowing Player 0 might reject.\n\nI will offer a small, consistent gain for me.\nPlayer 0 wants Brick. I have plenty of Brick.\nTarget Player 0 need for Brick.\nOffer 1 Brick (27). What do I want?\nI want Ore (32).\nIf I give 1 Brick (27) and get 1 Ore (32), I gain +5.\nThis implies Player 0 gives 32, gets 27, loses 5.\nThis is a small loss for Player 0, but they get the desirable Brick. It's possible they accept if their need for Brick is high enough.\n\nThis seems like the most reasonable profitable trade for me that they *might* accept, given past offers:\n1. It deals in Brick, which Player 0 indicated a strong desire for.\n2. It gives me my most valuable resource, Ore.\n3. The loss for Player 0 (5 value) is smaller than the losses in previous failed negotiations (13 and 14). This might be within their \"acceptable loss for critical resource\" threshold.\n\nMy most plausible next offer is this, as it adheres to \"increase total value\" for me and responds to Player 0's indicated needs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"offer\": {\n    \"from_player\": \"Player 1\",\n    \"to_player\": \"Player 0\",\n    \"offered_items\": [\n      {\"resource\": \"Brick\", \"quantity\": 1}\n    ],\n    \"requested_items\": [\n      {\"resource\": \"Ore\", \"quantity\": 1}\n    ]\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"Player 0's previous offers and requests indicate a strong desire for Brick (they wanted 3 Brick). My current inventory has a good quantity of Brick (22). I aim to increase my total resource value. Trading 1 Brick (value 27) for 1 Ore (value 32) results in a net value gain of +5 for me. This is a profitable trade for Player 1. While it results in a -5 value for Player 0, it provides them with a highly sought-after resource (Brick) at a relatively small loss compared to the large value losses in previously rejected offers between us. This small loss might be acceptable if their need for Brick is high, allowing for a mutually beneficial exchange in terms of meeting specific resource requirements, breaking the negotiation deadlock.\"\n}\n```",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Value Maximization**: The goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I should prioritize acquiring high-value resources (like Ore and Brick) and offloading lower-value resources that I have in abundance, especially if they provide diminishing returns for me.\n\n2. **Resource Valuation**: My current inventory has:\n   - Wheat: 18 units \u00d7 5 = 90\n   - Wood: 10 units \u00d7 9 = 90\n   - Sheep: 18 units \u00d7 15 = 270\n   - Brick: 15 units \u00d7 29 = 435\n   - Ore: 22 units \u00d7 40 = 880  \n   Total current value: 1,755.  \n   Ore and Brick dominate my portfolio. Sheep, while moderate in value, are held in high quantity.\n\n3. **Opportunity Cost and Surplus**: I have large quantities of Sheep (18) and Wheat (18). These may be less critical to hold in surplus. Trading excess Sheep and Wheat for higher-value resources (especially Brick or Ore) can boost total value.\n\n4. **Trading Psychology**: Reciprocity and fairness matter. Offers should appear balanced to increase acceptance likelihood. Extreme offers are likely rejected. Since Player 1 previously offered 1 Brick (value 29) for 2 Sheep (2\u00d715=30) and 1 Wheat (5), the proposed trade slightly favors me in value (29 vs 35), but the quantities are small and asymmetric.\n\n5. **Incremental Gains**: Even small profitable trades can compound over 10 turns. Low-risk, value-positive trades should be accepted if they align with surplus/deficit strategy.\n\n6. **Strategic Positioning**: If I can trade Sheep and Wheat for Brick or Ore, I increase total value. However, I already have substantial Brick and large Ore. So, I must assess whether marginal utility of more Brick/Ore is higher than diversifying or gaining Wood.\n\n7. **Current Offer Evaluation**:  \n   Player 1 offers: 1 Brick (value 29) \u2192 requests 2 Sheep (30) + 1 Wheat (5) \u2192 total value requested: 35  \n   They are offering 29 for 35 \u2014 a net loss of 6 value for me. This trade **decreases** my total value. Accepting would be disadvantageous.\n\nConclusion: The incoming offer from Player 1 is unfavorable. It asks for more total value than it provides. I should deny it unless it helps balance for a future strategic trade (no such indication yet).\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\nMy current resources and their values are: Wheat (24 @ 5), Wood (8 @ 12), Sheep (11 @ 13), Brick (22 @ 27), Ore (8 @ 32).\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I should aim to trade away lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or trade resources I have in abundance for resources I need.\nCalculating the value of each unit:\nWheat: 5\nWood: 12\nSheep: 13\nBrick: 27\nOre: 32\n\nObservations:\n- Brick (27) and Ore (32) are my highest value resources per unit.\n- Wheat (5) is my lowest value resource per unit.\n- I have a significant quantity of Wheat (24) and Brick (22), followed by Sheep (11). Wood (8) and Ore (8) are my scarcest resources.\n\nNegotiation Principles:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** Always aim to receive greater total value than you give up in a trade.\n2.  **Scarcity and Abundance:** Leverage resources you have in abundance (e.g., Wheat, Brick) to acquire more valuable or scarcer resources. Be cautious about giving up too much of your scarce, high-value resources.\n3.  **Understanding Opponent's Needs (Implicit):** While I don't know the opponent's exact inventory, past rejected offers (e.g., my offer of 2 Brick, 1 Wood for 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat) suggest they might value Sheep and Wheat less or Brick and Wood more than I do, or simply don't have enough to offer.\n4.  **Incremental Offers / Compromise:** If offers are consistently rejected, try smaller, more favorable (to the opponent) offers while still maintaining a profit margin for myself. My previous offers have been rejected, indicating my proposed value exchange isn't appealing enough to Player 0.\n5.  **Identify \"Good Deals\":** A good deal involves trading a resource where `(your value of resource out) < (your value of resource in)`. For example, trading 1 Wheat (5) for 1 Sheep (13) is a net gain of 8.\n6.  **Recalibrate based on rejections:** Player 0 rejected my offer (1 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat). Value of my offer: 27. Value of their offer: 2*13 + 1*5 = 31. This was a *loss* for me, which means I should not have offered it. I need to be more careful. Player 0 also rejected their own proposal of (5 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood) from earlier, which implies they might not have had those resources, or the values did not align for them.\n\nCurrent State:\nMy previous offer (1 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat) was a bad deal for me (27 vs 31), so it's good that it was rejected *for me*. Player 0 rejecting it is puzzling from their perspective (unless they didn't have the Sheep/Wheat).\nI need to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me in terms of value.\n\nLet's look for combinations:\n- Trading Wheat (5) for anything else is generally good.\n- Trading Wood (12) for Brick (27) or Ore (32) is good.\n- Trading Sheep (13) for Brick (27) or Ore (32) is good.\n\nI have 24 Wheat. It's my lowest value resource and I have the most of it. Can I trade a lot of Wheat for a higher value resource?\nExample:\n- 3 Wheat (15) for 1 Wood (12) - Bad for me.\n- 3 Wheat (15) for 1 Sheep (13) - Bad for me.\n- 5 Wheat (25) for 1 Brick (27) - Good for me (+2 value).\n- 6 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (32) - Good for me (+2 value).\n\nI also have 22 Brick, which is high value but I have a lot. I might be able to trade some Brick if I get something even more valuable, or a large quantity of something else.\nTrading Brick (27) for Ore (32) is good (+5 value). But I have the same quantity of Ore as Wood.\n\nI have been trying to acquire Sheep and Wheat in past turns, which are lower value items for me. This suggests I *don't* want them. My memory of previous turns might be confused. Let's re-read the negotiation history.\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> Requested: 3 Brick, 1 Wood.\n  - My side: Gaining (5*13 + 3*5) = 65+15 = 80. Giving up (3*27 + 1*12) = 81+12 = 93. *This was a bad deal for me (-13), good I rejected it.*\nMy offer: 2 Brick, 1 Wood -> Requested: 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat\n  - My side: Giving up (2*27 + 1*12) = 54+12 = 66. Gaining (5*13 + 3*5) = 65+15 = 80. *This was a good deal for me (+14)! Player 0 rejected it.* This tells me P0 values 5S/3W *less* than I do, or 2B/1W *more* than I do, or they simply didn't have 5S/3W.\n\nPlayer 0 made no new offer.\nMy offer: 1 Brick -> Requested: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat\n  - My side: Giving up (1*27) = 27. Gaining (2*13 + 1*5) = 26+5 = 31. *This was a good deal for me (+4)! Player 0 rejected it.* This strengthens the idea that P0 values Sheep/Wheat low OR Brick high.\n\nSince P0 is consistently rejecting my offers which are beneficial to me, it might mean they don't have the requested resources, or they value the resources I'm offering higher than I value them myself. I need to make an offer that might be *more* appealing to them, while still being beneficial to me.\n\nPerhaps offering *more* of my lower value items for their higher value items.\nI'm extremely rich in Wheat and Brick. Wheat is my lowest value.\nLet's try to trade a large amount of Wheat for a Brick or Ore.\n\nOption 1: Trade huge amount of Wheat for something small and valuable.\nOffer: 6 Wheat (Value 30) -> Request: 1 Ore (Value 32)\nNet Gain: +2. This is a small gain, but if P0 is desperate for Wheat, it might work. I have 24 Wheat.\n\nOption 2: Trade Wheat for Brick.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (Value 25) -> Request: 1 Brick (Value 27)\nNet Gain: +2. Also a small gain. I have 24 Wheat, 22 Brick.\n\nOption 3: Trade a little Brick for Ore.\nI have 22 Brick and 8 Ore. While 1 Brick (27) for 1 Ore (32) is a good trade for me (+5), I don't want to deplete my Ore. I want *more* Ore.\nOffer: 1 Brick (27) -> Request: 1 Ore (32) - Net gain +5. This is the best value per item. The opponent rejected \"1 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat\". Maybe they *don't* want Brick.\n\nGiven that Player 0 rejected my offer of `2 Brick, 1 Wood -> 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat` (a +14 value trade for me) and `1 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat` (a +4 value trade for me), it implies:\n1. Player 0 doesn't have 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat, or 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat (unlikely, but possible for exact quantities).\n2. Player 0 values Brick and Wood (what I offered) very highly, and Wheat and Sheep (what they would give) very lowly, even lower than my own low valuation. This makes sense for them to reject.\n\nIf Player 0 rejected my previous advantageous offers, I need to either:\na) Offer something Player 0 *needs* badly, even if it's less advantageous for me, and hope to get a better return later. (Risk losing value)\nb) Offer a *smaller* value proposition that is still positive for me, trying to test what they *will* accept.\n\nLet's re-evaluate their last *successful* rejection.\nP0 rejected no new offer. This is confusing. P0 implies they made no offer if it states \"Player 0 made no new trade offer\".\nThe last thing that happened was:\nP1: Offered items: 1 Brick -> Requested items: 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat (P0 rejected).\n\nI need to make an offer that is slightly more appealing to Player 0, while still remaining profitable.\nIf P0 values Brick highly and Sheep/Wheat low, they will definitely reject my offers of Brick for Sheep/Wheat.\n\nSo I need to *take* Brick from them, or give them Sheep/Wheat.\nI have a ton of Wheat.\nLet's try to offload some Wheat for something better.\n\nOffer: 8 Wheat (Value 40) -> Request: 1 Brick (Value 27) (Bad for me, -13) - No.\nThis highlights I need to *receive* higher value items.\n\nWhat if Player 0 needs a high quantity of a low-value resource?\nI have 24 Wheat.\nLet's try a bulk trade of low value for potentially useful higher value.\n\nConsider my values:\nWheat: 5 (Abundance: 24)\nWood: 12 (Scarcity: 8)\nSheep: 13 (Medium: 11)\nBrick: 27 (Abundance: 22)\nOre: 32 (Scarcity: 8)\n\nGoal: Increase total value. Ideal trades:\n- Exchange Wheat for anything else (especially Brick/Ore).\n- Exchange Brick for Ore.\n\nThe opponent *rejected* my previous offers where I was *gaining* value (2B, 1W -> 5S, 3W AND 1B -> 2S, 1W). This implies Player 0 either:\n1. Values Brick/Wood *much* higher than I do, making my offer unattractive to *them*.\n2. Does not have the Sheep/Wheat to trade.\n3. Values Sheep/Wheat *much* lower than I do.\n\nIf 1 or 3 is true, then I should *not* offer Brick/Wood, and I should *want* Sheep/Wheat even less.\nIt seems like Player 0 consistently undervalues Sheep and Wheat. This means I should not be trying to get Sheep or Wheat. And if they value Brick highly, I should be trying to get Brick *from* them.\n\nLet's reverse the thought. If P0 values Brick highly, I should *offer* Brick sparingly, or only for something more valuable.\nIf P0 undervalues Sheep and Wheat, I should try to *give them* Sheep and Wheat and recieve something else highly. I have 24 Wheat and 11 Sheep.\n\nLet's try to trade away my most abundant, lowest value resource (Wheat).\nMy best targets are Brick and Ore.\nTo get 1 Brick (27), I need to offer at least 6 Wheat (30) for a gain. This is good for me.\nTo get 1 Ore (32), I need to offer at least 7 Wheat (35) for a gain. This is good for me.\n\nLet's consider the opponent's previous offer: 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood (Rejected by me, a -13 value trade for me)\nThis indicates P0 wants Brick and Wood (valuing them highly) and is willing to give up Sheep and Wheat (valuing them low). This is consistent with my analysis.\n\nSo, I should *offer* Sheep/Wheat to get Brick/Wood/Ore.\nI should *not* offer Brick/Wood/Ore, unless the return is significantly higher for me.\n\nMy last offer was 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat. This was a +4 trade for me, but P0 rejected it. This supports the idea that P0 values Brick *very* highly, and my offer wasn't good *for them*. This means P0 will probably not give me Brick unless my offer is *very* good for them.\n\nLet's try to offer a large quantity of a low-value resource (Wheat), for a higher value resource (Brick/Wood/Ore).\nThe goal is to get more total value.\n\nSince P0 wants Brick and Wood, and is willing to give Sheep and Wheat:\nI should:\n- Give Sheep/Wheat generously.\n- Ask for Brick/Wood (and Ore, if possible).\n\nLet's try to get Brick. I still have 22 Brick. But if P0 wants Brick, then I should try to get even more Brick from them.\nOr maybe Wood, since I only have 8 Wood.\n\nOffer: 6 Wheat (value 30) -> Request: 1 Brick (value 27). This is a bad trade for me. (Losing 3)\nMy earlier math: 5 Wheat (25) for 1 Brick (27) is a gain of +2. This is a good trade for *me*.\nLet's offer this. It gives P0 a Brick, which they may want.\nThe value for me: -25 (Wheat out) + 27 (Brick in) = +2 total value.\nThis is a small, but positive gain. And it helps move my highest quantity, lowest value asset (Wheat).\n\nA similar trade for Ore:\n6 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (32) is a gain of +2. Also good for me.\nOre is my highest value resource, so getting Ore is great.\n\nWhich one is P0 more likely to accept?\nP0 has offered *5 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood*. This shows they *want* Brick and Wood, and are willing to give Sheep and Wheat.\nSo, offering them Wheat should be attractive if they have Brick/Wood/Ore to give me.\n\nLet's try to get a more valuable resource, Ore.\nMy current Ore is 8 units. Value 32.\nMy current Wheat is 24 units. Value 5.\n\nOffer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore\nValue for me: Out 6 * 5 = 30. In 1 * 32 = 32. Net gain: +2.\nThis is a small gain, but sustainable. P0 *wants* Wheat, so this should appeal to them. And giving 1 Ore might be acceptable if they have a decent amount (I don't know their inventory).\n\nConsider the quantity of Wheat I'm offering. 6 Wheat is a lot.\nIf I offer too much, P0 might reject because they don't value my incoming too much.\nIf I offer too little, it is not appealing enough for them.\n\nLet's try to bundle low value resources.\nFor example, a mix of Wheat and Sheep for something better.\nValue of 1 Sheep (13) + 1 Wheat (5) = 18.\nIf I could trade 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat for 1 Wood (12) \u2013 this is bad for me (-6).\nIf I could trade 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat for 1 Brick (27) \u2013 this is good for me (+9).\nIf I could trade 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat for 1 Ore (32) \u2013 this is good for me (+14).\n\nPlayer 0 rejected 3 previous offers from me (all good for me). I need to make one that is good for *both* sides, or extremely good for them while still positive for me.\nThe \"5 Wheat for 1 Brick\" trade: I lose 25 value, gain 27 value.\nThe \"6 Wheat for 1 Ore\" trade: I lose 30 value, gain 32 value.\n\nBoth offers are small positive changes for me. These should be easier for P0 to accept, especially if they are low on Wheat and I'm offering a lot.\n\nI will prioritize getting the highest value resource (Ore).\nOffer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore.\nThis is a large quantity of my lowest value item, for one unit of my highest value item.\nThis seems like a reasonable offer to test the waters.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \nIn this negotiation game, the goal is to increase the total value of my resources through strategic trades. Key principles and strategies relevant to my current situation include:\n\n1. **Resource Valuation**: Each resource has a fixed value: Wheat (5), Wood (9), Sheep (15), Brick (29), Ore (40). I must assess trades based on value flow \u2014 aiming to gain higher total value than what I give up.\n\n2. **Current Inventory Analysis**:\n   - I have large amounts of Wheat (18), Sheep (18), Brick (15), and especially Ore (22).\n   - Ore is the most valuable resource (40), but excess may be leveraged if I can trade it for mid-value resources to balance portfolio or increase count in higher-demand ones.\n   - Brick is also high value (29), and I have a healthy stock.\n   - Wood is my lowest quantity (10), and moderately valuable (9).\n   - Sheep and Wheat are mid-to-low value, but Sheep is worth 15 \u2014 making it valuable to trade selectively.\n\n3. **Opportunity Cost**: Holding too much of a high-value resource like Ore may limit trading leverage if others need it. But since Ore is most valuable, I should only trade it for favorable returns.\n\n4. **Trade Efficiency**: Aim for trades where requested resources have higher total value than offered. For example, giving 1 Ore (40) should ideally get >40 in return.\n\n5. **Player Behavior Patterns**:\n   - Player 1 has repeatedly offered trades valuing Ore and seeking Wheat and Sheep.\n   - Their latest offer: Give 6 Wheat (6\u00d75 = 30 value) for 1 Ore (40 value) \u2014 *they are offering 30 to get 40*. This is bad for me \u2014 I\u2019d lose value.\n   - Previous offers showed they are willing to trade Brick and Wood for Sheep and Wheat \u2014 suggesting they may be low on Sheep/Wheat or high on Brick/Wood.\n\n6. **Strategic Positioning**:\n   - I have surplus Sheep (18) and Wheat (18). I can afford to trade some away for higher value returns.\n   - I should aim to *acquire* more Ore or Brick if possible, but I already have a lot of both.\n   - Alternatively, trading excess Ore for Wood could balance my portfolio, as Wood is low.\n\n7. **Offer Design Principle**:\n   - Make offers that are slightly favorable to me but acceptable to the other player \u2014 increasing chance of acceptance.\n   - Example: Offer mid-value goods (Wheat, Sheep) to acquire high-value (Ore) or balanced-value (Wood, Brick) as needed.\n\n8. **Negotiation Leverage**:\n   - Since Player 1 keeps making offers, they likely want something I have (Sheep, Wheat, Ore).\n   - I can use this to propose a counter-offer that rebalances value flow in my favor.\n\nCurrent offer on table:  \nPlayer 1 offers: 6 Wheat \u2192 Request 1 Ore  \nValue to me: gain 30, lose 40 \u2192 net loss of 10 \u2192 **Unfavorable**\n\nI should **not** accept.\n\nInstead, I should make a strategic counter-offer that exploits Player 1\u2019s apparent need for Wheat/Sheep while acquiring something useful for me \u2014 perhaps Wood or Brick.\n\nGiven I have lower Wood (10), a good trade would be to offer excess (Wheat or Sheep) in exchange for Wood, or even extra Ore if possible.\n\nBut Player 1 undervalues Ore \u2014 they offered 6 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (40). So they may not pay fairly.\n\nAlternative: Flip their offer. I could *offer 1 Ore* if I get at least 8-9 Wheat (to match or exceed 40 value) \u2014 but they only offer 6.\n\nBetter counter: Use Sheep (value 15) \u2014 high enough to be attractive, and I have surplus.\n\nExample: Offer 2 Sheep (30) + 2 Wheat (10) = 40 value \u2192 Request 1 Wood (9) \u2014 no, too good for them.\n\nWait \u2014 I want to *gain value*. So instead, aim to get high-value return.\n\nBut if Player 1 values Wheat/Sheep, I can charge a premium.\n\nTry: Offer 1 Ore (40) \u2192 Request 3 Wood (3\u00d79 = 27) \u2014 still less value, but improves my low Wood stock. But net loss.\n\nBetter: Don\u2019t give away Ore. Instead, use Sheep/Wheat to get Wood or Brick.\n\nI have good Brick, but maybe trade some Sheep to get more Wood.\n\nBest idea: Exploit Player 1's desire for Wheat/Sheep. Offer a bundle they want, in exchange for Wood \u2014 something I need.\n\nProposed offer:  \nOffer: 5 Sheep (5\u00d715 = 75) and 3 Wheat (15) = 90 value \u2192 Request: 3 Brick (87) and maybe 1 Wood \u2192 total 96 \u2014 too much requested.\n\nAdjust:  \nOffer: 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat \u2192 Request: 3 Brick, 1 Wood \u2192 total offered 90, requested 87+9=96 \u2192 net gain 6 \u2014 good, but tried before, rejected.\n\nPlayer 1 made a symmetric counter-offer: 2 Brick, 1 Wood \u2192 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat \u2014 fair, but I rejected.\n\nPerhaps they want symmetry. Try a smaller, more attractive trade.\n\nNew idea: Use high Sheep to get Ore? But I already have 22 Ore \u2014 do I need more? Probably not.\n\nI should protect Ore, trade surplus Sheep/Wheat for Wood.\n\nTry:  \nOffer: 3 Sheep (45) \u2192 Request: 2 Wood (18) \u2014 too favorable for me, but may be acceptable.\n\nBut better offer:  \nOffer: 2 Sheep (30), 2 Wheat (10) = 40 \u2192 Request: 1 Wood (9) and 1 Brick (29) = 38 \u2192 I gain 38, lose 40 \u2192 minor loss, but diversifies.\n\nWait \u2014 I already have 15 Brick. Do I need more?\n\nPrioritize Wood.\n\nBetter: Offer 1 Sheep (15) and 3 Wheat (15) = 30 \u2192 Request 1 Wood (9) \u2014 bad for them.\n\nThey might accept giving 1 Wood for 1 Sheep \u2014 15 vs 9.\n\nSo offer: 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Wood\n\nOr to increase appeal: Offer 2 Wheat and 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Wood\n\nTotal value: 15+10 = 25 offered, gain 9 \u2192 not good for me.\n\nI must *gain* net value or at least balance.\n\nReverse: I have low Wood, but high Sheep and Wheat. Perhaps Wood is scarce for me \u2014 worth paying a small premium.\n\nBut ideally, design offers where total value in \u2265 value out.\n\nWait \u2014 their latest offer: 6 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore  \nThey are clearly willing to trade high quantity of low-value goods.\n\nExploit that.\n\nNew idea: I can **request more than 1 Ore in exchange for even more Wheat**, but I don't want to lose value.\n\nBut I already have 22 Ore \u2014 probably too much.\n\nAlternate strategy: **Convert surplus Ore into Wood or Brick**, but only if profitable.\n\nBut 1 Ore = 40. 4 Wood = 36 \u2014 close.\n\nSo offer: 1 Ore \u2192 Request 4 Wood\n\nBut I have 10 Wood \u2014 could use more.\n\nBut Player 1 may not have 4 Wood.\n\nTry a balanced offer using Sheep and Wheat, which I have surplus of, to get Wood.\n\nBest decision:\n\nDesign an offer where I trade some Sheep/Wheat \u2014 which I have plenty of \u2014 for Wood, even if slightly value-negative, to improve balance and future trading power.\n\nBut better: Since Player 1 wants Wheat, and I have 18, I can make an offer giving *some* Wheat in exchange for *Ore*? But I already have 22 Ore.\n\nI should avoid increasing Ore.\n\nInstead, trade Wheat for Wood.\n\nBut Player 1 might not want Wheat unless in bulk.\n\nThey offered 6 Wheat for 1 Ore \u2014 so they value bulk Wheat.\n\nSo I could **offer 6 Wheat** (they clearly want it) \u2192 but ask for 1 Wood and 1 Sheep back? I don\u2019t need Sheep \u2014 I have 18.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nWait \u2014 I want to increase total value. So any trade must either:\n- Gain high-value resources (Brick, Ore), or\n- Offload surplus low/mid-value (Wheat, Sheep) for slightly better return.\n\nBut my Sheep is worth 15 \u2014 higher than Wood (9) and Wheat (5). So trading Sheep for Wood is value-negative.\n\nSo **don\u2019t trade Sheep for Wood**.\n\nBest: Trade Wheat (5) for Wood (9) \u2014 but must give more Wheat.\n\nExample: Give 2 Wheat (10) \u2192 want at least 1 Wood (9), which is fair.\n\nBut who would accept giving 1 Wood for 2 Wheat? I wouldn\u2019t.\n\nBut Player 1 might, since they want Wheat.\n\nThey offered 6 Wheat for 1 Ore \u2014 so they clearly assign higher subjective value to Wheat.\n\nSo I can exploit that.\n\nI can *offer 1 Wood -> Request 10 Wheat*.\n\nBut I only have 10 Wood \u2014 and low stock.\n\nBut if I can get 10 Wheat (50) for 1 Wood (9), that\u2019s huge value gain.\n\nBut unlikely to be accepted.\n\nMore plausible: Offer 1 Wood \u2192 Request 5 Wheat\n\nValue: I gain 25, lose 9 \u2192 net +16 \u2014 good if accepted.\n\nBut do I want more Wheat? I already have 18.\n\nNo \u2014 I have surplus Wheat.\n\nSo that\u2019s bad.\n\nReal goal: Convert excess Wheat and Sheep into Wood or Brick, without losing value.\n\nBut Brick is 29 \u2014 so 6 Wheat is 30 \u2014 could trade 6 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick.\n\nThat\u2019s near-fair: lose 30, gain 29 \u2014 acceptable.\n\nAnd I have 18 Wheat \u2014 can spare 6.\n\nAnd Brick is high value \u2014 even though I have 15, one more is better.\n\nBetter: 5 Wheat (25) \u2192 1 Brick (29) \u2014 gain 4 value.\n\nPlayer 1 may accept if they want Wheat.\n\nBut do they have Brick to give?\n\nTheir prior offers suggest they do (offered 2 Brick earlier).\n\nSo try: Offer 6 Wheat \u2192 Request 1 Brick\n\nValue: I lose 30, gain 29 \u2192 net -1 \u2014 almost fair.\n\nOr better: Request 1 Brick and 1 Sheep? Too much.\n\nStick to small gain.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nAlternative: Offer 2 Sheep (30) \u2192 Request 1 Brick (29) \u2014 lose 1 value.\n\nStill fair.\n\nBut I have 18 Sheep \u2014 could spare 2.\n\nBut no real gain.\n\nIs there a way to gain Ore? Not needed.\n\nPerhaps do nothing \u2014 but I should act.\n\nAnother idea: Player 1 rejected when I tried to trade 5 Sheep + 3 Wheat for 3 Brick + 1 Wood.\n\nThey made a counter offering the same terms.\n\nSo they might be willing to accept if offer is repeated? But game says I made no new offer.\n\nBut same offer may be rejected again.\n\nInstead, adjust slightly.\n\nNew idea: Improve offer for them slightly to increase chance of acceptance, but still aim for net value gain.\n\nCurrent situation: Player 1 just offered 6 Wheat for 1 Ore \u2014 very bad for me.\n\nSo I **deny**.\n\nThen make my own offer.\n\nBest choice:\n\nUse surplus **Wheat (value 5)** to acquire **Brick (29)** or **Wood (9)**, but Wood is not worth much.\n\nBrick is best target.\n\nI already have 15 Brick \u2014 but each is 29 \u2014 good to have more.\n\nSo: Offer 6 Wheat \u2192 Request 1 Brick (they gain 30 in value, I gain 29 \u2014 fair trade)\n\nBut I lose 1 value \u2014 not ideal.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nHow about: Offer 1 Sheep \u2192 Request 1 Wheat and 1 Wood\n\nValue: I lose 15, gain 5+9=14 \u2014 close.\n\nBut not gain.\n\nOr: Offer 1 Wheat \u2192 Request 1 Wood \u2014 lose 5, gain 9 \u2014 **I gain 4 value** \u2014 excellent!\n\nBut who would give 1 Wood for 1 Wheat? Unlikely.\n\nPlayer 1 clearly wants Wheat \u2014 maybe they\u2019d do it?\n\nUnlikely \u2014 Wood is more useful for building.\n\nBut try a bundle.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nI will **make an offer** that leverages Player 1\u2019s revealed preference for Wheat by offering a quantity they seem to value (6 Wheat), in exchange for a high-value return.\n\nBut they offered 6 Wheat for 1 Ore \u2014 so they *really* want Wheat.\n\nSo I can **ask for something valuable in return for 5 or 6 Wheat**.\n\nBest: Request 1 Brick (29) for 5 Wheat (25) \u2192 I gain 4 value.\n\nAnd I have 18 Wheat \u2014 can spare 5.\n\nSo: [Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\n\nThat\u2019s efficient.\n\nOr even: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood? But 1 Wood = 9 \u2014 I\u2019d lose 16 value \u2014 bad.\n\nNo.\n\nSo 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick is good.\n\nOr 3 Wheat + 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick: 15+15=30 vs 29 \u2014 lose 1.\n\nBut 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick is better for me.\n\nPlayer 1 may accept since they like Wheat.\n\nAlternatively, to increase chance: 6 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick + 1 Sheep? Too much.\n\nStick to value-positive.\n\nBut 5 Wheat (25) \u2192 1 Brick (29) is **value-positive for me**.\n\nYes!\n\nAnd for them: they gain 25 value, lose 29 \u2014 lose 4. Might not accept.\n\nSo perhaps offer 6 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick\n\nThen I lose 30, gain 29 \u2014 net -1\n\nThey gain 30, lose 29 \u2014 net +1 for them \u2014 they might accept.\n\nAnd I get more Brick \u2014 which is good.\n\nGiven that I have 18 Wheat, losing 6 is fine.\n\nAnd I improve total value? Slightly down, but increases Brick count \u2014 might help future trades.\n\nBut goal is to increase total value.\n\nCurrent total value:\n- Wheat: 18\u00d75 = 90\n- Wood: 10\u00d79 = 90\n- Sheep: 18\u00d715 = 270\n- Brick: 15\u00d729 = 435\n- Ore: 22\u00d740 = 880  \nTotal: 90+90+270+435+880 = 1765\n\nAfter trading 6 Wheat \u2192 gain 1 Brick:\n- Lose 6 Wheat: -30\n- Gain 1 Brick: +29\n- New total: 1765 -30 +29 = 1764 \u2014 slight decrease.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nCan I trade 1 Sheep (15) for something worth more?\n\nOr 1 Ore (40) for 9 Wheat (45)? But I don\u2019t want more Wheat.\n\nOr for 2 Wood and 1 Brick: 18+29=47 \u2014 yes!\n\nSo: Offer 1 Ore \u2192 Request 2 Wood and 1 Brick\n\nValue: I lose 40, gain 47 \u2014 **+7 net gain**\n\nAnd I have 22 Ore \u2014 can spare 1.\n\nHave 10 Wood \u2014 can use more.\n\nHave 15 Brick \u2014 one more would be good.\n\nAnd Player 1 has offered Brick before \u2014 may have supply.\n\nEven if they give 2 Wood and 1 Brick, they lose 47, gain 40 \u2014 lose 7 \u2014 but if they need Ore, they might accept.\n\nPlayer 1 previously wanted Ore \u2014 they requested 1 Ore for 6 Wheat.\n\nSo they value Ore.\n\nSo this offer is reasonable.\n\nI should make it.\n\nBut is it the best?\n\nAnother option: Offer 1 Sheep (15) \u2192 Request 3 Wheat (15) \u2014 fair, but no gain, and I have too much Wheat.\n\nNo.\n\nOr: Offer 2 Sheep (30) \u2192 Request 1 Ore (40) \u2014 want to gain 10.\n\nBut unlikely.\n\nBest value-positive trade: give Ore to get Wood+Brick.\n\nSo: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Wood, 1 Brick]\n\nLet\u2019s compute:\n- I give: 1 Ore\n- I get: 2 Wood and 1 Brick\n\nYes.\n\nThis increases my total value by 7.\n\nAnd improves resource balance.\n\nPlayer 1 may accept if they need Ore.\n\nGiven their behavior, they do.\n\nSo I make this offer.\n\n[Deny] for current offer (6 Wheat for 1 Ore) \u2014 because it\u2019s bad for me.\n\nThen make new offer.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Wood, 1 Brick]",

This trade would decrease my total value. Reject.\n\n4.  **Strategic Principles for My Offers:**\n    *   **Increase Total Value:** Any trade I propose must result in a net gain in value for *me*.\n    *   **Leverage High Quantity/Low Value:** I have a lot of Wheat (24). This is my lowest value resource. I should prioritize trading Wheat for higher-value resources.\n    *   **Acquire High Value Resources:** My goal is to get more Ore, Brick, or potentially Sheep/Wood if the trade is favorable.\n    *   **Maintain Flexibility (Avoid Over-Specialization):** While improving value, ensure I don't deplete one resource so much that it limits future options.\n    *   **Small, Incremental Gains:** Multiple small, positive-value trades are better than waiting for one large perfect trade.\n    *   **Propose Fair-ish Trades (from my perspective):** Offers that benefit me but don't seem outrageously unfair to Player 0 are more likely to be accepted. The \"6 Wheat for 1 Ore\" attempt was probably too steep for Player 0 (30 value for 32 value, asking them to lose 2 value).\n    *   **Adapt to Opponent's Rejections:** Player 0 has rejected several of my offers, suggesting they find them unfavorable. My last offer of \"6 Wheat -> 1 Ore\" was rejected, which meant Player 0 valued their Ore more than 6 Wheat, or they value Wheat less.\n\n5.  **Re-evaluate based on past rejections and current state:**\n    *   Player 0 rejected \"6 Wheat -> 1 Ore\". This implies 1 Ore (32) is worth more than 6 Wheat (30) to them, or they don't value Wheat at my rate, or they simply have enough Wheat.\n    *   Player 0 offered \"5 Wheat -> 1 Brick\". This confirms they value Brick highly (they want it) and are willing to exchange Wheat for it. They offered to lose 2 value. This means they are desperate for Brick or they value their Wheat less than I do.\n\n6.  **Formulate a new offer:**\n    *   I need to increase my value.\n    *   I have plenty of Wheat and Brick. I want more Ore.\n    *   Player 0 wants Brick. I have 22 Brick (high quantity, high value).\n    *   Can I use my excess Brick to get something *more* valuable from Player 0? Or perhaps less valuable but with a significant quantity advantage?\n    *   Given Player 0 wants Brick (they offered for it), I could offer some Brick for something else.\n    *   Let's try to trade Wheat, but make it more appealing. Or trade a small amount of Brick for a higher *net* value gain.\n    *   If I offer my low-value Wheat, it needs to be very appealing.\n    *   If I offer my high-value Brick, it needs to get me something *much* better.\n    *   Consider Player 0's offer of 5 Wheat for 1 Brick. This implies they are willing to *give* 5 Wheat for 1 Brick.\n    *   Let's try to trade some of my lower value resources, perhaps wood or sheep, for ore or brick, if i can get a good deal.\n    *   Alternatively, focus on my plentiful Wheat. My last Wheat offer (6 Wheat for 1 Ore) was rejected. Maybe 7, 8, or even 9 Wheat for 1 Ore could work if Player 0 values Ore highly but also has excess Wheat, or a strong need for one of my resources. 9 Wheat for 1 Ore is 45 value for 32 value, a 13 point loss for me. Not good.\n    *   My objective is to increase total value for myself.\n    *   How about using some of my abundant Brick to get something valuable, with a net gain?\n    *   I reject their offer of 5 Wheat for 1 Brick. I do not want to lose value.\n\n    Let's make a new offer that is clearly beneficial to me:\n    *   Target: Acquire Ore (highest value per unit) or something else I'm low on.\n    *   Offer: My abundant Wheat (lowest value per unit).\n    *   What if I offer a smaller amount of Wheat for a lower value resource from them, but still make a gain? Unlikely to work given the rejections.\n    *   What if I try to get something I need (Ore) for something \"less critical\" for me, but that Player 0 might value?\n    *   My resources: Wheat (5), Wood (12), Sheep (13), Brick (27), Ore (32).\n    *   Player 0 asked for Brick, meaning they need it. I have plenty (22).\n    *   If I offer a small amount of Brick, I need a significant overpay from Player 0.\n    *   Example: Offer 1 Brick (27 value) for 3 Ore (96 value) - this would be amazing but is a -69 value for Player 0, unlikely.\n    *   What about using my abundance of Brick (valued at 27) and hoping Player 0 needs it badly enough to overpay slightly?\n    *   What if I try to get Ore using a different resource than Wheat, perhaps Wood for Ore? 1 Wood (12 value) would be impossible for 1 Ore (32).\n    *   Go back to Wheat.\n    *   Player 0 rejected 6 Wheat for 1 Ore. Maybe 7 Wheat for 1 Ore? That's (7 * 5) = 35 value for 1 Ore (32 value). This is a net gain for Player 0 of +3 value. This might be accepted, and I get a high-value resource. I gain \"high-value\" Ore, giving up \"low-value\" Wheat. However, my total value decreases by 3. This is not my goal.\n\n    My goal is to increase my *total value*.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate the previous offer: Player 0 offered 5 Wheat (25) for 1 Brick (27). Rejected (net -2).\n    This implies Player 0 needs brick.\n    What if I offer Player 0 a small amount of Brick for a significant amount of Wheat? This plays into their perceived need for Brick and would give me more of my lowest value resource, which doesn't directly increase my value.\n\n    The last rejected offer I made was 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore. (30 value -> 32 value). A loss of 2 value for me. Even if accepted, it reduces my value. I should never make an offer that reduces my current total value.\n\n    I need to craft an offer where:\n    Value of (Resources I give) < Value of (Resources I receive)\n\n    What about trading 1 Wood (12 value) for 3 Wheat (15 value)? (Net +3 for me).\n    I have 8 Wood and 24 Wheat. This could work for me. It diversifies my lowest-value resource. It's a small gain.\n\n    What about trading Sheep for Wheat to consolidate? 1 Sheep (13 value) for 3 Wheat (15 value)? (Net +2 for me). I have 11 Sheep.\n\n    Let's try to get Ore.\n    Can I trade something higher value for Ore, but gain a significant amount of Ore?\n    Example: 1 Brick (27) for 1 Ore (32). Net value change +5 for me. (This is asking for Player 0 to lose 5 value, probably reject).\n    This is the core problem: to gain value, Player 0 must *lose* value, or we must have different valuation systems (which we don't, in this game).\n    The only way to consistently gain value is if Player 0 values the resources I'm *giving* more than I do, and values the resources I'm *receiving* less than I do.\n    But the game states \"total value of your resources increases\".\n\n    Let's look at the current resources again: Wheat: 24 (5), Wood: 8 (12), Sheep: 11 (13), Brick: 22 (27), Ore: 8 (32).\n\n    Given Player 0's desperate offer for Brick, maybe I can exploit that.\n    If I trade 1 Brick (27) for 2 Sheep (26). This is a loss of 1 for me. No.\n\n    How about 1 Brick (27) for 2 Wood (24). Still loss.\n\n    What about offering several low-value items for one high-value item that results in a net gain for me?\n    Maybe 1 Wood (12) and 1 Sheep (13) = 25 value. Could I get 1 Brick (27) for that? Yes, a net gain of 2 for me.\n    [Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\n    My current: Wood: 8, Sheep: 11.\n    After trade, if accepted: Wood: 7, Sheep: 10, Brick: 23.\n    Value change: (1 * 27) - (1 * 12 + 1 * 13) = 27 - 25 = +2. This is a net gain for me.\n    Player 0 would lose 2 value. Will they accept? They seem desperate for Brick. This is a mild loss for them.\n\n    Let's try that.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: My resources have varying individual values, with Ore (40) > Brick (29) > Sheep (15) > Wood (9) > Wheat (5). I should aim to acquire more high-value resources (Ore, Brick) and trade away lower-value ones (Wheat, Wood), especially in excess.\n\n2. **Resource Abundance and Opportunity Cost**: I have large quantities of Wheat (18), Sheep (18), and Ore (22). While Ore is high-value, having 22 units may exceed immediate needs, making selective trading for other high-value resources (like Brick) profitable. However, trading Ore should be done judiciously unless receiving significantly higher value in return.\n\n3. **Marginal Utility and Saturation**: Having 15 Brick and 22 Ore suggests I may be close to saturation for these high-value resources. However, since the goal is to *increase total value*, trading down to acquire more medium-value resources in greater volume (e.g., converting excess low-value resources into Brick) can still be beneficial.\n\n4. **Negotiation Leverage**: Player 1 appears interested in Wheat and Sheep (low-to-medium value to me), and is offering Brick (high value). This gives me leverage: they likely need basic resources for production, while I can capitalize by exchanging surplus Wheat/Sheep for Brick.\n\n5. **Balancing Trade Ratios**: I must ensure trade ratios are favorable. For instance, 1 Brick (29) should be worth roughly 6 Wheat (5\u00d76=30) or 2 Sheep (15\u00d72=30). Offers like \"1 Wood + 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick\" (value 9+15=24 \u2192 29) are slightly favorable to the receiver (Player 0), so I should consider accepting such offers if they help me acquire higher-value resources efficiently.\n\n6. **Asymmetric Valuation**: Player 1 may value resources differently due to their own inventory. Their repeated offers for Wheat and Sheep suggest high demand for these. I should exploit this by demanding premium returns (e.g., Brick or Ore) in exchange.\n\n7. **Incremental Gains**: Small, favorable trades can compound over 10 turns. A trade like giving 2 Sheep (30) and 1 Wheat (5) (total 35) for 1 Brick (29) is *unfavorable* (losing 6 value). I should only accept trades where requested resources' total value is equal or higher than offered.\n\n8. **Trade Offer Evaluation**:  \n   - Current offer from Player 1: **1 Wood, 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick**  \n     - Offered to me: 1 Brick (29)  \n     - Requested from me: 1 Wood (9) + 1 Sheep (15) = 24  \n     - Net gain: +5 value (29 - 24) \u2014 a small but positive gain.  \n     - I have 10 Wood and 18 Sheep \u2014 surplus. Losing 1 of each is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, this is a **favorable trade** in terms of value and resource availability.\n\n[Accept]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Optimization:** My primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I should aim to trade away resources that are less valuable to me (or that I have in abundance) for resources that are more valuable.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** Calculate the per-unit value of each resource.\n    *   Wheat: 5\n    *   Wood: 12\n    *   Sheep: 13\n    *   Brick: 27\n    *   Ore: 32\n3.  **Identify Abundance and Scarcity:** I have a lot of Wheat (24) and Brick (22). I have fewer quantities of Wood (8), Sheep (11), and Ore (8). While Brick has a high value, its abundance might make it a good resource to trade if I can get even higher value in return or consolidate other high-value resources. Wheat is low value and abundant, making it a prime candidate for trading away.\n4.  **Target High-Value Resources:** Ore (32) and Brick (27) have the highest per-unit value. I should prioritize acquiring these, especially Ore, or trading less valuable resources for them.\n5.  **Calculate Trade Ratios:** Determine favorable exchange rates. For example, if I offer 6 Wheat (30 value) for 1 Ore (32 value), it's a slight gain. If I offer a low-value resource for a high-value one, even a 1:1 trade might be profitable if the values align (e.g., 1 Wood (12) for 1 Sheep (13) is a slight gain).\n6.  **Analyze Past Trades:**\n    *   Player 0 accepted my offer: 1 Wood (12) + 1 Sheep (13) [Total 25] -> 1 Brick (27). This was a good trade for me, increasing my total value by 2 (27 - 25 = 2). This demonstrates Player 0 might be willing to trade higher-value resources for a combination of moderate-value ones.\n    *   Player 0 rejected 6 Wheat for 1 Ore. This indicates they value Ore highly or don't want that many Wheat.\n    *   Player 0 offered 5 Wheat for 1 Brick. This implies they value Brick more than 5 Wheat (25 value), or they have an excess of Wheat and need Brick. My rejection was correct as I'd be losing value (27 value for 25 value).\n7.  **Formulate Offers:**\n    *   Target: Acquire more Ore, or Brick (if the ratio is good).\n    *   Offer: My abundant, lower-value resources (Wheat, and potentially Wood/Sheep in favorable combos, or even Brick if the return is significant like Ore).\n    *   Consider 2:1 or 3:1 trades if it benefits me (e.g., 2-3 Wheat for 1 Sheep/Wood, or 1 Wood/Sheep for a partial higher-value resource).\n8.  **Patience and Persistence:** The game lasts 10 turns. I don't need to make massive trades every turn. Small, consistent gains add up. Rejections are part of the process.\n\n**Current Resources (after previous trade):**\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 24 (Value: 5) = 120\n*   [Wood]  Qty: 7 (Value: 12) = 84 (Lost 1 Wood)\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 10 (Value: 13) = 130 (Lost 1 Sheep)\n*   [Brick] Qty: 23 (Value: 27) = 621 (Gained 1 Brick)\n*   [Ore]   Qty: 8 (Value: 32) = 256\nTotal Value: 120 + 84 + 130 + 621 + 256 = 1211\n\nMy total value increased from (24*5 + 8*12 + 11*13 + 22*27 + 8*32) = 120 + 96 + 143 + 594 + 256 = 1209 to 1211. Good.\n\nNow, let's look for the next move.\nPlayer 0 accepted the previous trade, suggesting they found 1 Brick to be worth 1 Wood and 1 Sheep. This is useful information. I still have a lot of Wheat and Brick. I still want Ore.\n\nStrategy:\n*   Try trading Wheat for higher-value resources.\n*   Consider trading Brick if I can get a really good deal for Ore.\n*   Avoid trades where my outgoing value is higher than my incoming value.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again. Last time, 6 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (32) was rejected. Maybe a slightly higher offer of Wheat, or a combination.\nHow about a direct trade of an abundant high-value resource for another high-value resource?\nFor example, a Brick for an Ore, if I can make the value work. 1 Brick (27) for 1 Ore (32) would be great. However, Player 0 seems to want Brick.\n\nLet's target Ore, using Wheat or a mix.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (25) + 1 Sheep (13) = 38\nRequest: 1 Ore (32) + 1 Wood (12) = 44 (Maybe too much to ask)\n\nSimpler:\nWhat if I offer a mix of lower-value resources for a high-value target?\nMy high quantity of Wheat (24) is a good target for offloading.\nTry to get Sheep or Wood for Wheat.\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep] (Value: 15 -> 13) Bad for me.\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood] (Value: 10 -> 12) Good for me, but maybe they don't value Wood.\n\nLet's capitalize on the fact that Player 0 might need Brick.\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (27) for 1 Ore (32) and something else small? No, stick to direct value.\n1 Brick (27) for 1 Ore (32) is a win for me.\nGiven Player 0 values Brick, maybe they'd do this? It's a net gain of 5 value.\n\nAlternative: Try to get Sheep or Wood with Wheat, as Wheat is abundant and low value.\nPlayer 0 seemed to want Brick, and they traded 1 Brick for 1 Wood and 1 Sheep. This means they valued 1 Brick >= 25 value.\n\nLet's try a direct trade of my less valuable common resource (Wheat) for their high-value resource (Ore), but adjust the ratio based on the observed rejection (6 Wheat for 1 Ore).\n6 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (32) was rejected.\nMaybe 7 Wheat (35) for 1 Ore (32)? This is a loss for me.\nThis indicates Player 0 values their Ore highly.\n\nLet's try a combination again, using my high quantity of Wheat and something else.\nMy previous successful trade involved giving Sheep and Wood.\nWhat about offering a high quantity of Wheat, for something higher value?\nExample: 8 Wheat (40) for 1 Brick (27) and 1 Wood (12) = 39. This is good, but 8 Wheat is a lot.\n\nGiven Player 0 accepted 1 Wood, 1 Sheep for 1 Brick, it suggests they value Brick highly, but also needed Wood and Sheep.\nI still have a lot of Wheat and Brick.\nMy priority is still to acquire Ore if possible, or increase overall value with other resources.\n\nLet's consider trading a slightly smaller amount of Wheat for a Wood or a Sheep.\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep] (10 value -> 13 value) This is a gain.\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood] (10 value -> 12 value) This is a gain.\nPlayer 0 rejected 5 Wheat for 1 Brick (25 vs 27), so 2 Wheat for 1 Wood/Sheep might look better to them if they need it.\n\nMy lowest value resource is Wheat. My highest value resource is Ore.\nI want more Ore. Player 0 has rejected 6 Wheat for 1 Ore.\nWhat if I offer something more substantial that I have a lot of, like Brick, to get Ore?\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore] (27 value -> 32 value) This is a gain of 5. It's a direct upgrade.\nPlayer 0 showed they need Brick by taking 1 Brick for 1 Wood and 1 Sheep. This might be a viable offer.\n\nLet's try this. This is a very clean, high-value gain for me.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n\n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: My current resources have the following individual values:  \n   - Ore: 40 (highest)  \n   - Brick: 29  \n   - Sheep: 15  \n   - Wood: 9  \n   - Wheat: 5 (lowest)  \n\n   This means I should prioritize acquiring high-value resources (Ore, Brick) and be cautious about giving them away unless receiving fair or surplus value in return.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost & Trade Efficiency**: When trading, I should aim to exchange low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for high-value ones (Brick, Ore, Sheep). Trading high-value for low-value leads to net loss unless part of a strategic surplus utilization.\n\n3. **Surplus vs. Scarcity**:  \n   - I have **abundant Wheat and Sheep** (18 each), so I can afford to trade these more freely.  \n   - I have moderate Wood (10) and Brick (15), which are valuable \u2014 Brick especially (value 29).  \n   - Ore is most valuable (40), and I already have 22 \u2014 quite a lot. However, since its value is highest, others may want it; I should be cautious giving it away unless receiving significant value.\n\n4. **Trade Ratios & Fairness**:  \n   Using value ratios to assess fairness:  \n   - 1 Brick (29) \u2248 5\u20136 Sheep (15\u00d72=30) or 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat + change  \n   - 1 Wood (9) \u2248 1\u20132 Wheat (5) + small return  \n   - 1 Ore (40) \u2248 1.4 Bricks or 8 Wheat  \n\n   Trades should aim for positive net value or strategic gain (e.g., freeing up capacity, diversifying).\n\n5. **Player Behavior Patterns**:  \n   - Player 1 seems to **value Brick highly** \u2014 keeps requesting it in exchange for lower-value bundles.  \n   - They are offering 1 Wood + 1 Sheep (value: 9 + 15 = 24) for 1 Brick (29) \u2014 slightly under, but close. I accepted that trade \u2014 net loss of 5 value, but I have surplus Sheep and Wheat, so acceptable if aiming to reduce excess.  \n   - Now they offer 3 Wheat (value 15) for 1 Sheep (15) \u2014 fair in value but not advantageous. No gain.\n\n6. **Trading Strategy on Turn 9**:  \n   - Only 2 turns left \u2014 limited future opportunities. Should act decisively.  \n   - Since I accepted a prior offer, and Player 1 is persistent, I should either accept favorable offers or make one that improves my portfolio.  \n   - I still have **18 Sheep, 18 Wheat** \u2014 large surplus. Reducing these is beneficial if I gain higher-value or more balanced resources.  \n   - I have **15 Brick, 22 Ore** \u2014 both high value, so I should **avoid giving them away unless excellent return**.\n\n7. **Current Offer from Player 1**:  \n   - Offered: 3 Wheat \u2192 Requested: 1 Sheep  \n   - Value: 15 \u21d4 15 \u2014 fair, but no net gain.  \n   - I have many Sheep (18), and could gain more Wheat (already 18). This trade would **increase my least valuable resource (Wheat)** and **decrease a medium-value one (Sheep)**.  \n   - **Not beneficial** \u2014 would decrease portfolio value unless I'm trying to accumulate Wheat for some reason (unlikely, since lowest value).  \n\nDecision: Deny the offer, and attempt to **make a counter-offer** that leverages my surplus (Wheat, Sheep) to gain higher-value or scarce resources.\n\nI should target **Ore or Brick**, but I already have a lot. Alternatively, **Wood** might be worth increasing slightly to round out portfolio, but not urgent.\n\nWait: I already gave up 1 Brick in the accepted trade. I still have 14 Brick now (after losing 1). Ore is at 22 \u2014 very high. I should **avoid giving away Ore**.\n\nBetter move: **Offer surplus Wheat and Sheep to gain Brick or Wood**, but only if profitable.\n\nFor example:  \nOffer: 5 Wheat + 1 Sheep (value: 25 + 15 = 40) \u2192 Request: 1 Ore (value 40) \u2192 fair, but Ore is already high in quantity. Not ideal.\n\nAlternatively:  \nOffer: 2 Sheep + 2 Wheat (30 + 10 = 40) \u2192 Request: 1 Brick (29) \u2192 overpaying.\n\nBetter:  \nOffer: 3 Sheep (45) \u2192 Request: 1 Brick (29) + 1 Wheat (5) \u2192 net gain? No, I lose 11 value.\n\nI should **flip the script**: since Player 1 wants Brick but undervalues it, I can **ask for high return**.\n\nBut I already accepted their last offer.\n\nNow they make a poor offer.\n\nBest move: **Deny**, and **make a new offer** that improves my position.\n\nIdea: I have **10 Wood** \u2014 value 9, not high, but I don\u2019t have a lot. Maybe I can **trade excess Sheep/Wheat for Wood**? But Wood is low value.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe Player 1 needs Brick for development, so they might trade Wood or Sheep for it.\n\nBut I already traded 1 Brick.\n\nPerhaps **target a net gain trade**:  \nI could offer **5 Wheat (25)** and request **2 Wood (18)** and get return? But 25 > 18 \u2014 they won\u2019t accept.\n\nReverse: I could **request a trade that balances value and increases total value**.\n\nWait \u2014 my **total value** is:  \n18\u00d75 = 90 (Wheat)  \n10\u00d79 = 90 (Wood)  \n18\u00d715 = 270 (Sheep)  \n14\u00d729 = 406 (Brick, after trade)  \n22\u00d740 = 880 (Ore)  \nTotal \u2248 **1746**\n\nIf I can **increase Brick or Ore**, that would help, but hard.\n\nBetter: **Use surplus Sheep/Wheat to gain more Ore or Brick**, but prices are high.\n\nPlayer 1 just offered 3 Wheat \u2192 1 Sheep: clearly trying to **reduce their Wheat, gain Sheep** \u2014 perhaps they need Sheep for development.\n\nSo I can **leverage that**: they want Sheep, so I should **charge more**.\n\nBest Strategy: **Deny their offer**, and **make a new offer** where I give **fewer Sheep for more value**.\n\nProposal: Offer 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat \u2192 Request 1 Brick\n\nValue: I give 15+5=20, get 29 \u2014 net +9. Very good.\n\nBut will they accept? They previously offered 1 Brick for 1 Wood + 1 Sheep (15+9=24 vs 29), so close. Now I\u2019m offering even less (only 16 total). Probably reject.\n\nBut worth trying.\n\nAlternatively: Offer 1 Sheep \u2192 Request 1 Wood + 1 Wheat? 15 \u21d4 9+5=14 \u2014 small gain, but not significant.\n\nBetter: Stick with value gain.\n\nGiven that Player 1 has already offered 1 Brick for 1 Sheep + 1 Wood, and I have Sheep to spare, I can **counter with a trade that costs them more**.\n\nBut now I'm choosing my move.\n\nTheir current offer: 3 Wheat \u2192 1 Sheep \u2192 I should **Deny**, and **make a better offer**.\n\nDecision:\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]  \n\nWait \u2014 I already have 14 Brick. Is gaining one more worth 16 value? Yes: 29 > 16 \u2014 net gain of 13 value.\n\nGood.\n\nBut they might not accept, but it\u2019s rational \u2014 I'm giving low-cost items, requesting high-value.\n\nAlternatively, increase odds: Offer 2 Sheep \u2192 Request 1 Brick + 1 Wood (45 offered, 29+9=38 requested) \u2014 but I lose value.\n\nNo \u2014 I should **only accept or make value-positive (for me) trades**.\n\nSo [Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick] gives me:  \n- Gain: +1 Brick (29)  \n- Loss: -1 Sheep (15), -1 Wheat (5) \u2192 net +9 value.\n\nPerfect.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",
