This directly increases overall portfolio value.  \n- **Liquidate Low-Value Surpluses**: Offload resources with low per-unit value (e.g., **Wood**, value 12) to acquire higher-value resources (e.g., **Brick**, value 22), especially if quantities are imbalanced.  \n- **Bargaining Power from Scarcity**: Resources you hold abundantly (e.g., **Wood**, 24 units) can be traded aggressively, but avoid accepting trades that bring more low-value surplus unless it enables future high-value exchanges.  \n- **Risk of Diminishing Returns**: Excess resources (like **Wood**) may become harder to trade later. Neutralizing losses (e.g., trading Wood for Ore) is acceptable if it prevents waste.  \n- **Tactical Rejections**: If a trade reduces your total value or amplifies existing imbalances without strategic upside, reject it. Preserve high-value resources aggressively.  \n\n### Step 2: Apply Knowledge to the Current Offer  \n**Player 1's Offer**:  \n- Receive: **4 Wood** (Value: 4 \u00d7 12 = **48**)  \n- Give: **3 Brick** (Value: 3 \u00d7 22 = **66**)  \n- **Net Value Change**: 48 (received) - 66 (given) = **-18** (loss).  \n\n**Analysis**:  \n- **Value Impact**: The trade reduces your total value by 18, conflicting with the core goal.  \n- **Resource Imbalances**: You already have excess **Wood** (24 units \u2192 288 value), but **Brick** is high-value (22 per unit) with moderate stock (17 units). Acquiring more Wood worsens surplus without upside.  \n- **Strategic Harm**: Player 1\u2019s offer exploits your high Brick value. Accepting would incentivize them to demand more Brick in future, eroding your advantage.  \n- **No Strategic Rationale**: No evidence suggests this enables a future high-value trade.  \n\n**Decision**: **Deny** the offer to avoid value loss and preserve high-value resources.  \n\n---\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge: Key Principles and Strategies for Resource Trading\n1. **Value Maximization Focus**: The primary goal is to increase the total value of your resources. Assess each trade by calculating its net impact: (value of resources received) minus (value of resources given up). A trade should only be accepted if the net impact is positive.\n2. **Resource Valuation**: Prioritize trading based on per-unit values. Identify low-value resources (e.g., Wheat and Wood) as \"give\" candidates and high-value resources (e.g., Ore and Brick) as \"get\" candidates. Your current resource values per unit: Wheat (6), Wood (12), Sheep (14), Brick (22), Ore (40).\n3. **Negotiation Leverage**: Player 1 has shown interest in Brick (offering Wood for Brick before). This suggests Brick is desirable to them. Use this to propose trades that benefit you by offering Brick sparingly or demanding high-value returns.\n4. **Counter-Offering Strategy**: If an offer is unfavorable, deny it and propose a counter-offer that targets high-value resources. Focus on:\n   - Giving low-value surpluses (e.g., Wheat or Wood) to gain higher-value resources.\n   - Ensuring your offer has a clear positive net value gain.\n5. **Risk Avoidance**: Avoid trades that reduce your high-value resource stock (e.g., Ore) or increase exposure to low-value resources. Sheep is mid-value\u2014net gains should be significant to justify trading it.\n6. **Trade Volume and Efficiency**: Smaller, high-gain trades are preferable. You have surpluses in Wood (16) and Wheat (11)\u2014target exchanging these for Ore or Brick to compound value faster.\n7. **Behavioral Insight**: Player 1 accepted a previous Wood-for-Brick trade, showing they may overvalue Brick or undervalue Wood. Replicate this by offering low-value resources for their high-value ones when possible.\n\n### Trading Decision\n- **Assessment of Player 1's Offer**:  \n  Player 1 offered: 3 Sheep (value: 3 \u00d7 14 = 42) and 2 Ore (value: 2 \u00d7 40 = 80), requesting 5 Brick (value: 5 \u00d7 22 = 110) and 2 Sheep (value: 2 \u00d7 14 = 28).  \n  Net value impact for you:  \n  (42 + 80) - (110 + 28) = 122 - 138 = **-16**.  \n  **Decision**: This trade decreases your total value significantly, so it must be denied.\n\n- **Counter-Offer Strategy**:  \n  To increase value, propose trading your low-value surplus (Wheat at 6) for Player 1's high-value resource (Ore at 40).  \n  Offer: **11 Wheat \u2192 4 Ore**.  \n  Reasoning:  \n  - Give 11 Wheat (value: 11 \u00d7 6 = 66).  \n  - Get 4 Ore (value: 4 \u00d7 40 = 160).  \n  Net gain: 160 - 66 = **+94**.  \n  This exploits Wheat's low value (your surplus) to gain high-value Ore, with minimal risk.\n\n**Action**:  \n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 11 Wheat -> 4 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge:\nIn this negotiation game, maximizing the total value of your resources is the primary goal. Based on current circumstances and past interactions, the following knowledge is essential for decision-making:\n\n1. **Value Optimization Principle**: Trade low-value resources for high-value ones to achieve net value gains. Your resource values per unit are: Wheat (6), Wood (12), Sheep (14), Brick (22), Ore (40). Focus on acquiring Ore (highest value) by offloading lower-value resources like Wood or Sheep.\n   \n2. **Historical Trend**: Player 1 accepted trades that benefited you significantly (e.g., 11 Wheat [value 66] for 4 Ore [value 160], net +94; 8 Wood [value 96] for 5 Brick [value 110], net +14). This suggests Player 1 may have a surplus of Ore/Brick or values resources differently, making Ore a viable target.\n\n3. **Resource Abundance**: With only 10 turns total and after previous trades, you now have:\n   - High quantities of Wood (16 units) and Ore (26 units), but Wood has lower value (12) than Ore (40).\n   - Depleted Wheat (0 units) limits options involving this resource.\n   - Your Brick and Sheep quantities are moderate (22 and 9), but their values are below Ore.\n\n4. **Risk vs. Reward**: Prioritize offers with clear positive net gains. Avoid uneven exchanges like those rejected earlier (e.g., Player 1's 4 Wood for 3 Brick would have lost 18 value). Aggressive but plausible offers (e.g., >10 net gain) are feasible given Player 1's acceptance history.\n\n5. **Opponent Behavior Insight**: Player 1 actively seeks resource swaps (e.g., proposing lopsided trades like 3 Sheep + 2 Ore for 5 Brick + 2 Sheep, which you wisely denied). Counter this by offering bundles that appeal to their potential needs (e.g., bulk Wood).\n\n### Trading Decision:\nApplying the above knowledge:\n- **Target**: Acquire more Ore (value 40/unit) to maximize gains. Trade excess Wood (value 12/unit) to minimize opportunity cost.\n- **Ideal Ratio**: 5 Wood (costs 60) for 2 Ore (gains 80) yields **+20 net value**, a high-return proposition comparable to past successful trades.\n- **Feasibility**:  \n  - Player 1 accepted Wood-for-resource trades before (8 Wood for 5 Brick), indicating openness to Wood deals.\n  - Your Wood stock (16) allows this without material depletion.\n\n**Action**: Offer 5 Wood to Player 1 in exchange for 2 Ore.  \n***Format***: `[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]`",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Value Assessment**: Understanding the value of resources is crucial. Higher value resources are more desirable, hence trading them can increase total value. Resources with both high quantity and high value should be prioritized for trade.\n\n2. **Demand Awareness**: Players will often seek the resources they need most. Observing patterns in offers can indicate what resources Players want, allowing me to align my offers with their needs.\n\n3. **Quantitative Balancing**: When making offers, ensure that the quantity of resources provided balances well against those requested. Under-offering can lead to rejections, while over-offering can diminish total resource value.\n\n4. **Negotiation Strategies**: Building rapport with other players through reasonable offers can lead to better trades. Additionally, being flexible and making multiple offers can facilitate trades.\n\n5. **Trade Dynamics**: Keep track of the trade activity, noting past trades to adjust future offers. This provides insights into the trading behavior and preferences of Player 0.\n\n### Trading Decision:\n\nCurrently, I have the following resources after my trades:\n- Wheat: 1 (remaining after last trade)\n- Wood: 17 (after accepting Player 0\u2019s last offer)\n- Sheep: 14 (remained unchanged)\n- Brick: 17 (gained from trades)\n- Ore: 10 (gained from trades)\n\n#### Analyzing Current Offers:\n\nPlayer 0's latest offer is:\n- Offered: 5 Wood\n- Requested: 2 Ore\n\n**Evaluate this Offer**:\n- Current resources: I have 17 Wood and the value of Ore is higher (34 vs. 12 per Wood).\n- Accepting this could reduce my Wood stock, but would result in gaining a higher-value resource in Ore.\n\n### Decision:\n\nGiven the current values and the dynamics of the game, I will **accept Player 0's offer** for 5 Wood in exchange for 2 Ore, which increases my total resource value.\n\n**Action:**\n`[Accept]`",

      "response": "### Knowledge Generation\n\nAs Player 0, I analyze the situation to maximize my resource value through trading. Key principles and strategies for this negotiation include:\n\n1. **Maximizing Net Value Gain**: Prioritize trades where the value of requested resources exceeds the value of offered resources. My fixed values per unit make this straightforward: Ore (40) > Brick (22) > Sheep (14) > Wood (12) > Wheat (6). I aim for trades yielding a positive net gain in total value.\n   \n2. **Historical Analysis**: Player 1 consistently accepts trades where I offer Wood for Ore (e.g., 5 Wood for 2 Ore, gaining 20 value). They also rejected trades when they faced a net loss (e.g., their Brick-focused offers) but accepted lopsided deals (like 11 Wheat for 4 Ore, where I gained 94 value). This suggests Player 1 undervalues Ore or overvalues basic resources, creating exploitable opportunities.\n\n3. **Resource Portfolio Optimization**:  \n   - **Current Holdings**:  \n     - Wood: 11 (low value; 12/unit)  \n     - Sheep: 9 (moderate; 14/unit, slow-moving in trades)  \n     - Brick: 22 (high value; 22/unit, but Player 1 covets it, implying leverage)  \n     - Ore: 28 (highest value; 40/unit, ideal to acquire).  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Wheat is depleted. Wood is abundant but low-value. Brick has high value but risks diminishing returns if over-traded.  \n   - **Strategy**: Prioritize liquidating Wood into Ore (historically profitable) and optionally pair with Brick/Ore trades if favorable. Avoid Sheep\u2014untested and potentially illiquid.\n\n4. **Risk Mitigation**:  \n   - Repeat proven trades (Wood \u2192 Ore) for reliable gains.  \n   - Avoid speculative offers (e.g., Sheep) without Player 1 demand signals.  \n   - Ensure trades leave sufficient resources for future flexibility, though the 10-turn limit simplifies long-term planning.\n\n5. **Behavioral Insight**: Player 1 is highly receptive to Ore trades, implying surplus. Capitalize on this before their strategy shifts. With only 2 turns left, prioritize quick, high-confidence deals over experimentation.\n\n### Trading Decision\nI offer **5 Wood for 2 Ore**, replicating a highly successful past trade (net gain: 20 value). This proposal:\n- Leverages historical acceptance.\n- Converts low-value Wood (5 \u00d7 12 = 60 value given) into high-value Ore (2 \u00d7 40 = 80 value received).\n- Maintains resource safety (leaving 6 Wood and ample Brick/Sheep for contingencies).\n\n**Action**: [Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Ore]",
