      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nBased on my current situation in the Negotiation Game, where I aim to increase the total value of my resources over 10 turns, here are the key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are most relevant:\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: Prioritize trades where the total value of resources received exceeds the total value of resources given. This ensures net gains in overall resource worth. For example, with resources like Wheat (low value at 6 per unit) in abundance, I should trade them for higher-value items like Wood (11 per unit) or Brick (25 per unit) to boost my portfolio.\n\n2. **Leverage Abundance and Scarcity**: Trade resources I have in large quantities (e.g., Wheat: 19 qty, Sheep: 23 qty, Ore: 19 qty) for those I have less of or that offer higher value per unit. This reduces overstocking and promotes balance, while minimizing risk of hoarding low-utility items. For instance, my Wheat has the lowest value, making it ideal for trading away.\n\n3. **Negotiation Strategy**: Start with conservative, mutually beneficial offers to encourage acceptance, especially early in the game. Avoid overcommitting high-value resources (e.g., Ore at 37 per unit) unless the return is significantly better. Offers should be clear and focused on what the other player might need, assuming they value diversity or scarcity in their own resources.\n\n4. **Game-Limited Turns**: With only 10 turns, act decisively to secure value gains early. Avoid risky or complex trades that might not be accepted, and default to denying incoming offers if they don't improve my total value. Track net value changes per trade to ensure long-term progress.\n\n5. **Risk and Fairness Assessment**: In negotiations, players may have different valuations, so propose trades where I gain value based on my metrics. However, make offers that are reasonably attractive to others to foster ongoing negotiations, as rejected offers could limit future opportunities.\n\nIn my situation, I have a total resource value of 1580 (calculated as: Wheat 19*6=114, Wood 9*11=99, Sheep 23*18=414, Brick 10*25=250, Ore 19*37=703). I should focus on trading low-value, abundant resources like Wheat for higher-value ones like Wood to incrementally increase this total.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision\n\nApplying these principles, I will propose a trade that leverages my abundance of Wheat (low value of 6 per unit) to acquire Wood (higher value of 11 per unit), resulting in a net value gain. Specifically, offering 1 Wheat (value: 6) for 1 Wood (value: 11) would increase my total value by 5, aligning with value maximization and scarcity strategy. This is a simple, low-risk offer to start the game and test negotiations.\n\n[Offer: 1 Wheat -> 1 Wood]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. **Understand Personal Value System:** My primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. To do this, I need to know the value of each resource I own. I have: Wheat (6), Wood (11), Sheep (17), Brick (22), Ore (34).\n2. **Identify Resource Surplus/Deficit (Implicit):** While not explicitly stated in quantities, I should think about which resources I have \"more of\" or \"less of\" relative to their individual value, or how they might be used in potential future turns. Currently, I have plenty of Wheat (22) and Wood (21) which are lower value, and fewer Brick (9) which are higher value. Ore (14) and Sheep (16) are in the middle.\n3. **Calculate Value per Unit:** Already provided, but crucial for evaluating trades.\n4. **Evaluate Opponent's Offer:** The current offer is 1 Wheat (Value 6) for 1 Wood (Value 11). This is a net gain of 5 value for me (11 - 6 = 5). This is a good immediate trade.\n5. **Formulate Counter-Offers (if necessary):** If the current offer wasn't good, I would formulate a counter-offer focusing on maximizing my value gain and potentially offloading lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n6. **Consider Future Turns (Long-term vs. Short-term):** This is turn 1 of 10. While immediate value gain is good, I should also consider potential future needs or how certain resource types might become more valuable later (e.g., if there are \"building\" phases though not specified here). For now, pure value gain is paramount.\n7. **Negotiation Principles:**\n    *   **\"Win-Win\" Ideology (if possible):** While my goal is self-gain, an offer that also benefits the opponent slightly makes them more likely to accept.\n    *   **Anchor and Adjust:** If I were making the first offer, I might start slightly high and be willing to come down.\n    *   **Walk-Away Point:** Know when to deny an offer if it doesn't meet my minimum value threshold.\n    *   **Scarcity and Demand:** What resources might my opponent need, and what do I have in abundance that they might want? (Cannot truly know this for Player 0, but can infer from their offer). Player 0 offering Wood suggests they value it, or have a surplus of Wheat.\n8. **Risk Assessment:** A simple 1-for-1 trade is low risk. Complex trades need more careful value calculation.\n\nBased on the knowledge:\nThe current offer is: Offered 1 Wheat (Value 6) -> Requested 1 Wood (Value 11).\nMy current value: (22*6) + (21*11) + (16*17) + (9*22) + (14*34) = 132 + 231 + 272 + 198 + 476 = 1309.\nIf I accept: I lose 1 Wheat (value 6) and gain 1 Wood (value 11).\nMy new value would be: (21*6) + (22*11) + (16*17) + (9*22) + (14*34) = 126 + 242 + 272 + 198 + 476 = 1314.\nThis is a net gain of 5 in total value.

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are relevant to my current situation as Player 0. First, **maximizing value** is paramount; I should always aim to trade resources where the net value gained exceeds the value lost, based on my personal valuations. For instance, my resources have varying values (e.g., Wheat at 6 per unit vs. Ore at 37 per unit), so I should prioritize trading low-value resources for high-value ones to increase my total resource value.\n\nSecond, **considering scarcity and abundance** is crucial. I have an abundance of Wheat (18 units) and Sheep (23 units), which are relatively low-value, making them ideal for trading. Conversely, I have fewer Brick (10 units) and a high-value resource like Ore (19 units), so I should be cautious about trading these away unless I receive significant value in return. This aligns with the principle of **opportunity cost**\u2014ensuring that any trade doesn't deplete my high-value holdings without a clear benefit.\n\nThird, **negotiation dynamics** play a role, especially since the game is turn-based with only 10 turns total. I should make offers that are attractive to the other player (e.g., based on their previous acceptance of my Wheat-for-Wood trade, they may value Wheat highly) while maintaining leverage. Strategies include starting with favorable offers to build goodwill, avoiding overtrading in early turns, and using incremental trades to test responses. Additionally, **fairness and reciprocity** can encourage acceptance; offers should appear balanced from the other player's perspective, but always tilted in my favor.\n\nFinally, **risk management** is key in a limited-turn game. I need to act efficiently to accumulate value quickly, monitor my opponent's preferences (e.g., Player 1 accepted my previous offer, suggesting they prioritize Wheat), and avoid stalemates by making decisive moves. Overall, insights from game theory emphasize that successful trading involves predicting opponent needs and ensuring each trade incrementally boosts my total value.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nApplying this knowledge, my recent trade (giving 1 Wheat for 1 Wood) increased my total value from 1580 to 1585, confirming that trading low-value resources like Wheat for higher-value ones like Wood is effective. I still have an abundance of low-value Wheat (now 18 units) and Sheep (23 units), which I can leverage to target high-value resources like Brick (value 25) or Ore (value 37) from Player 1.\n\nTo maximize value, I'll propose another trade offering excess Wheat and Sheep (low value) in exchange for Brick (high value). This builds on Player 1's apparent interest in Wheat while ensuring I gain more value than I lose. Specifically, I'll offer 2 Wheat (value: 2 * 6 = 12) and 1 Sheep (value: 18) for 1 Brick (value: 25), resulting in a net gain of 25 - (12 + 18) = -5 in immediate value\u2014wait, no: actually, this would be a net loss based on my calculations, so I need to adjust for a positive outcome.\n\nCorrection: To ensure a net gain, I should offer just enough to make it appealing but still profitable. Offering 3 Wheat (value: 3 * 6 = 18) for 1 Brick (value: 25) gives me a net gain of 25 - 18 = 7, which is ideal. This trade uses my abundant, low-value resource while acquiring a higher-value one, aligning with scarcity strategies and encouraging reciprocity.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I should only make trades where the value of what I receive is greater than the value of what I give up.\n2.  **Scarcity and Demand:** Resources with higher values (Ore, Brick, Sheep) are generally more desirable. Resources with lower values (Wheat, Wood) are more abundant and typically given away. I should be cautious about trading away high-value resources unless I get a significant return.\n3.  **Understanding Opponent's Needs (Inferred):** Player 0 just traded 1 Wheat for 1 Wood and now offers 3 Wheat for 1 Brick. This suggests Player 0 values Wood and Brick more than Wheat. They might be trying to complete a building or achieve a specific resource ratio.\n4.  **Resource Overstock/Understock:** I have a good quantity of Wheat (22) and Wood (21), and a decent amount of Sheep (16) and Ore (14). My lowest quantity is Brick (9), which is also a high-value item.

I can't afford to make bad value trades.\n\nTrading Decision:\nThe offer is 3 Wheat (value 18) for 1 Brick (value 22). This is a net gain of 4 value for me (22 - 18 = 4). I have an abundance of Wheat (22 units), so giving up 3 is not an issue quantity-wise. Also, Brick is a high-value resource of which I currently have the least quantity.

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\nBefore making a trading decision, I've generated relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation based on my current situation. Here's a summary of the key principles, strategies, and insights:\n\n- **Value Maximization Principle**: The core goal is to ensure that any trade results in a net increase in the total value of my resources. This involves comparing the value of resources I'm offering against what I'm receiving. For instance, resources like Wheat (value 6) are low-value for me, so trading them for higher-value items like Brick (value 25) or Wood (value 11) can be advantageous. A good rule is to aim for trades where the total incoming value exceeds the outgoing value by at least 10-20% to account for potential risks.\n\n- **Resource Abundance and Scarcity Strategy**: I have an abundance of Wheat (15 qty) and Sheep (23 qty), which are relatively low-value resources for me, making them ideal for trading. In contrast, I have limited Wood (10 qty) and Brick (11 qty), and a high stock of Ore (19 qty) with very high value (37), so I should avoid trading Ore unless I can get significantly more value in return. Trading excess resources for scarce ones can help balance my portfolio and prepare for future needs in a multi-turn game.\n\n- **Negotiation Dynamics Insight**: Since Player 1 has accepted my previous offers (e.g., 1 Wheat for 1 Wood and 3 Wheat for 1 Brick), they may be open to further trades, especially if they need Wheat. I should start with fair but favorable offers to build goodwill, as rejecting or over-demanding could sour relations in this 10-turn game. However, I must escalate cautiously\u2014offering slightly better deals over time to test their limits while avoiding exploitation that might lead to denials.\n\n- **Risk Management Strategy**: With only 10 turns total, I need to avoid depleting my resources too quickly. This means prioritizing trades that provide immediate value gains without overcommitting (e.g., don't offer more than 20-30% of a resource in one go). Additionally, consider opportunity cost: If I trade Wheat now, I might need it later, so ensure the trade aligns with long-term value growth.\n\n- **Fair Trade Ratios and Psychological Factors**: Base offers on approximate value ratios to make them appealing. For example, if Wheat (value 6) is offered for Brick (value 25), the ratio should favor me but not be exploitative (e.g., 3-4 Wheat for 1 Brick). Players are more likely to accept if the trade feels mutually beneficial, so framing offers around what they might need (based on past accepts) can improve success rates.\n\nThis knowledge applies directly to my situation, where I've already gained value from two trades, increasing my total resource value. I'll now use it to decide on my next action.\n\n### Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge, my current resources are:\n- Wheat: 15 qty (low value, abundant\u2014good for trading)\n- Wood: 10 qty (moderate value, recently acquired)\n- Sheep: 23 qty (moderate value, abundant)\n- Brick: 11 qty (high value, just increased)\n- Ore: 19 qty (very high value, hold onto)\n\nI've successfully traded Wheat for higher-value resources before, so I'll continue this strategy to maximize value. Player 1 has shown interest in Wheat, so I'll offer some for another Brick, aiming for a net value gain (e.g., offering 4 Wheat worth 24 for 1 Brick worth 25, a slight gain). This maintains the pattern of fair but profitable trades without risking my high-value Ore.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

This means evaluating trades not just by quantity, but by the value of what you gain versus what you give up.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** Each resource has a given value.

This means I should always calculate the net value gain (value of resources received minus value of resources given) and only proceed if it's positive. For instance, my resources have varying values (e.g., Wheat at 6 is low, while Ore at 37 is high), so I should prioritize trading low-value resources for high-value ones to boost my overall portfolio.\n\n- **Negotiation Strategy Based on History:** From past trades, Player 1 has accepted offers where they received Wheat (a low-value resource for me) in exchange for Wood and Brick, but rejected a 4 Wheat for 1 Brick deal. This suggests Player 1 values Wheat enough to trade, but there's a limit to how much they're willing to give up for it\u2014perhaps they want deals that feel fair or beneficial to them. I should start with offers that are slightly more generous than the rejected one to build goodwill, while still ensuring I gain value. Escalating demands (like increasing Wheat offered) led to rejection, so I need to vary my offers to avoid patterns and test their preferences.\n\n- **Resource Scarcity and Abundance Insight:** I have an abundance of Wheat (19 qty, low value), Sheep (23 qty, medium value), and Ore (19 qty, high value), which gives me leverage to trade excess without depleting critical stocks. Conversely, I should target resources like Brick (high value at 25) or potentially more Ore to diversify and increase total value. However, I must avoid over-trading high-value resources like Ore, as it could hurt my long-term position in this 10-turn game.\n\n- **Reciprocity and Fairness Strategy:** Trades are more likely to be accepted if they appear balanced from the other player's perspective. Based on Player 1's acceptance of my previous offers (e.g., 3 Wheat for 1 Brick, where I gained net value but it wasn't overly one-sided), I should aim for offers where the value exchanged is somewhat close, but still favors me. This encourages ongoing negotiations rather than alienating Player 1.\n\n- **Turn Efficiency Insight:** With only 10 turns total, I need to be decisive and iterative. Learn from rejections (e.g., the 4 Wheat for 1 Brick rejection indicates a threshold) and make offers that evolve based on feedback. If no counter-offers come from Player 1, I should continue initiating to keep the game moving and accumulate value quickly.\n\nIn summary, my strategy is to leverage my abundant, low-value resources (like Wheat) to acquire higher-value ones, while ensuring offers are calibrated to Player 1's apparent preferences to maximize acceptance rates and overall value gains.\n\n### Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge, I'll focus on trading more of my low-value Wheat (which I have in abundance) for a high-value resource like Brick, but I'll adjust from the rejected offer (4 Wheat for 1 Brick) to make it more appealing. Previously, 3 Wheat for 1 Brick was accepted, so offering 4 Wheat again might work if I pair it with something else or keep it simple. Net value calculation for my proposed offer: Offering 4 Wheat (4 * 6 = 24 value) for 1 Brick (25 value) results in a small net gain of 1 value, which aligns with value maximization while staying close to what was previously accepted.\n\nI'll make a new offer to Player 1: [Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

This helps in evaluating proposed trades.\n2. **Prioritize high-value resources:** Focus on acquiring resources that have a high value to you (e.g., Ore, Brick, Sheep) and offloading those with lower value (e.g., Wheat, Wood) if it benefits your overall value.\n3. **Identify undervalued resources in offers:** If Player 0 is consistently offering low-value resources for higher-value ones, there's a potential asymmetry. Look for opportunities where Player 0 might be overpaying for something you value less.\n4. **Calculate net value change per trade:** For every proposed trade, calculate the total value of resources you would gain vs. the total value of resources you would give up. Only accept trades where `Value(gained resources) > Value(given resources)`.\n5. **Consider future needs/synergies (if applicable):** While not explicitly stated, in many games, certain resources are needed for building or crafting. If this were a factor, it would influence what resources to acquire. For now, pure monetary value is the primary driver.\n6. **Be patient but not passive:** Don't accept every offer. Wait for good opportunities. However, also make offers yourself if Player 0 isn't initiating beneficial trades. (Though in this case, Player 0 is making offers to Player 1).\n7. **Bargaining:** If an offer is close but not quite right, consider counter-offering or rejecting to signal your valuation. Player 0 previously offered 4 Wheat for 1 Brick and it was rejected. They've offered the same thing again. This suggests they might be persistent for Brick, or perhaps they have a surplus of Wheat.\n8. **Analyze opponent's likely strategy:** Player 0 seems to be trying to acquire Brick. This could mean Brick is valuable to them, or they have a need for it. They are offering Wheat, which is low value for Player 1.\n9. **Don't overvalue your own low-value resources:** While you want to get good value, be willing to part with abundant low-value resources if it means acquiring something more valuable.\n\nCurrent Resources and Values:\n+ [Wheat] Qty: 22 Value: 6 (Total: 132)\n+ [Wood] Qty: 21 Value: 11 (Total: 231)\n+ [Sheep] Qty: 16 Value: 17 (Total: 272)\n+ [Brick] Qty: 9 Value: 22 (Total: 198)\n+ [Ore] Qty: 14 Value: 34 (Total: 476)\nTotal Current Value: 132 + 231 + 272 + 198 + 476 = 1309\n\nPlayer 0's offer: Offered items: 4 Wheat -> Requested items: 1 Brick\n\nCurrent Offer Evaluation:\nResources received: 4 Wheat (Value: 4 * 6 = 24)\nResources given: 1 Brick (Value: 1 * 22 = 22)\n\nNet value change: 24 (received) - 22 (given) = +2\n\nThis trade offers a positive net value change. It's a small gain, but a gain nonetheless, and it utilizes a resource (Wheat) that is less valuable to me, to acquire a more valuable resource (Brick), while increasing my overall value.

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nIn resource trading and negotiation, especially in a competitive game with limited turns (only 10 total), several key principles and strategies are crucial for maximizing my total resource value. Here's a summary of the most relevant ones for my current situation:\n\n- **Value Maximization**: Always prioritize trades where the total value of resources received exceeds the value of resources given. My resources have assigned values (e.g., Wheat at 6, Brick at 25), so I should calculate the net value gain for each potential trade. For instance, trading low-value, abundant resources (like Wheat or Sheep) for high-value ones (like Brick or Ore) directly increases my overall portfolio value.\n\n- **Abundance and Scarcity Management**: I have high quantities of lower-value resources (e.g., 19 Wheat at value 6 each and 23 Sheep at value 18 each), which makes them ideal for trading. Conversely, I should seek to acquire more of higher-value resources (e.g., Ore at 37 each) that are relatively scarce for me or offer greater long-term utility. This leverages my strengths while addressing weaknesses, ensuring efficient resource diversification.\n\n- **Negotiation Patterns and Adaptation**: From the game history, Player 1 has accepted trades involving Wheat for Brick (e.g., 3 Wheat for 1 Brick, and later 4 Wheat for 1 Brick), indicating they value Wheat and are willing to part with Brick under certain conditions. However, they rejected an initial offer of 4 Wheat for 1 Brick, suggesting a threshold for fairness or changing needs. I should start with offers that provide a slight value edge for me while appearing reasonable to them, and adjust based on past responses to avoid rejection.\n\n- **Turn Efficiency and Risk Mitigation**: With only 10 turns, I need to make decisive, high-impact trades early to build value quickly. Avoid overcommitting resources in a single trade and focus on incremental gains (e.g., net gains of 5-7 value per trade from history). If an offer is rejected, I can refine it in the next turn, but prolonged stalemates could waste opportunities.\n\n- **Fairness and Psychological Factors**: Offers should balance my gains with perceived fairness to encourage acceptance. For example, trading resources in ratios that align with value differences (e.g., multiple low-value items for one high-value item) can make the deal appealing without signaling desperation. Since Player 1 has been passive (making no new offers), I should continue initiating trades to control the pace.\n\nThese insights emphasize trading my excess low-value resources for high-value ones to steadily increase my total value, while adapting to Player 1's behavior.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge, I assess my current resources and recent trades. I have an abundance of Wheat (19 units), which I've successfully traded for Brick (value 25) in the past, yielding net gains (e.g., 3 Wheat worth 18 for 1 Brick worth 25 = +7 value). However, to further maximize value, I should target Ore (value 37), my highest-value resource, as acquiring more of it would provide a significant boost. \n\nI still have plenty of Wheat to offer, so I'll propose a trade that mirrors successful past offers: offering multiple Wheat (low value) for a single high-value resource. Specifically, offering 5 Wheat (total value: 5 * 6 = 30) for 1 Ore (value: 37) would result in a net gain of 7 value for me, which is efficient and aligns with my history of incremental gains. This trade leverages my abundance, respects turn efficiency, and builds on Player 1's willingness to trade (as they've accepted Wheat-based offers before). If rejected, I can adjust in the next turn.\n\nBased on this, my decision is to make the following offer to Player 1.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nBefore making a trading decision, I'll generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation based on my current situation. Key principles, strategies, and insights include:\n\n- **Value Maximization**: The core goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I should only trade if the net value gained exceeds the value lost. For example, my resources have the following values: Wheat (6), Wood (11), Sheep (18), Brick (25), and Ore (37). Prioritize trading lower-value resources (like Wheat) for higher-value ones (like Brick or Ore) to ensure a positive net gain.\n\n- **Opportunity Cost and Scarcity**: Consider the scarcity of resources for both myself and the other player. I have abundant Wheat (currently 11 qty) but limited higher-value resources like Ore (19 qty) and Brick (12 qty). From the trade history, Player 1 has accepted trades involving Wheat for Wood and Brick, indicating they might value Wheat or have excess of those resources. However, they rejected offers for Ore, suggesting Ore is scarce or highly valued by them. I should avoid over-trading scarce resources and focus on exploiting my excess to gain what I lack.\n\n- **Negotiation Patterns and Adaptation**: Analyze past interactions to inform future offers. Player 1 has accepted multiple Wheat-for-Brick trades (e.g., 3 Wheat for 1 Brick and later 4 Wheat for 1 Brick) but rejected 5 Wheat for 1 Ore. This implies they have a threshold for what they consider fair\u2014perhaps based on their own resource values or needs. A good strategy is to start with conservative offers and adjust based on rejections (e.g., reduce the amount offered or try variations). In a limited-turn game (only 10 turns total), I need to be efficient and avoid prolonged negotiations that waste turns.\n\n- **Risk Management and Fairness Perception**: Offers should appear reasonable to encourage acceptance. Overly aggressive trades (e.g., demanding too much) can lead to rejections, as seen with the 5 Wheat for 1 Ore offer. I should calculate rough value equivalences to propose balanced deals\u2014for instance, if 5 Wheat (value: 30) was rejected for 1 Ore (value: 37), trying a slightly less demanding offer might work. Additionally, diversify offers if one type repeatedly fails, but stick to trading my excess (Wheat) to minimize risk.\n\n- **Game Context**: With turns limited, prioritize quick, high-impact trades that build my resource value early. My current portfolio is strong in low-value resources, so focusing on upgrading via trades aligns with long-term goals.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nApplying this knowledge, I'll evaluate my current resources: Wheat (11 qty, low value), Wood (10 qty), Sheep (23 qty), Brick (12 qty), and Ore (19 qty). I've successfully traded Wheat for Brick and Wood before, increasing my total value, but the last offer (5 Wheat for 1 Ore) was rejected, likely because it was too demanding for Player 1.\n\nTo maximize value, I should continue trading excess Wheat for higher-value resources like Ore, but adjust based on past rejections. Offering 4 Wheat (value: 24) for 1 Ore (value: 37) provides a net gain for me (13 value points) while being less aggressive than the previous 5 Wheat offer. This adapts to Player 1's rejection pattern and maintains efficiency in this turn-limited game. If rejected, I can refine further in future turns.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",
