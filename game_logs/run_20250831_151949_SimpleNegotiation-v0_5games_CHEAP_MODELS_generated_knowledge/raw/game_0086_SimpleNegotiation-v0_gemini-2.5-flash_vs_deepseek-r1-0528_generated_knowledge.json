      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This means I should always evaluate trades based on `(Value of Requested Resources) - (Value of Offered Resources)`. A trade is beneficial if this difference is positive.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** Each resource has a per-unit value. I need to calculate the total value of any proposed offer and request.\n3.  **Surplus for Trade:** Identify resources I have in abundance (high quantity) and/or resources with a relatively low value that I might be willing to trade away.\n    *   Wheat: Qty 21 (Value 6) - Abundant, low value. Good candidate to trade.\n    *   Wood: Qty 18 (Value 8) - Moderate quantity, low value. Good candidate to trade.\n    *   Sheep: Qty 18 (Value 14) - Moderate quantity, moderate value. Could be traded if the return is significant.\n    *   Brick: Qty 24 (Value 27) - High quantity, high value. Good to hold onto or trade for even higher value.\n    *   Ore: Qty 17 (Value 35) - Moderate quantity, highest value. I should be very reluctant to trade Ore unless the gains are substantial.\n4.  **Desired Resources:** Identify resources that are highly valuable and I might want to acquire more of, even if my current quantity is high (e.g., Brick, Ore).\n5.  **Batches, not just 1:1:** Trades don't have to be 1:1. I can offer multiple low-value items for one high-value item, or vice versa.\n6.  **Strategic Offers:** Make offers that are clearly advantageous to me but *potentially* appealing to the other player. For example, offer a resource I have in abundance and they might need, for a resource I value highly.\n7.  **Calculating Offer Value:**\n    *   My current total value: (21 * 6) + (18 * 8) + (18 * 14) + (24 * 27) + (17 * 35) = 126 + 144 + 252 + 648 + 595 = 1765\n    *   Example: Offer 3 Wheat (18) for 1 Brick (27). Net gain = 9. This is a good trade.\n    *   Example: Offer 2 Wood (16) for 1 Ore (35). Net gain = 19. This is a good trade.\n8.  **Propose first:** Since I am Player 0, I have the initiative. I should make an offer that benefits me and tests what the other player values.\n\nMy strategy will be to trade away lower-value, abundant resources (Wheat, Wood) for higher-value resources (Brick, Ore, Sheep).

      "response": "### Knowledge Generation\nBefore responding to Player 0's offer, I consider these key principles of resource trading and negotiation:\n1. **Value Optimization**: Trade only if it increases my total resource value. Resources have fixed per-unit values (Wheat=5, Wood=11, Sheep=16, Brick=23, Ore=40), so trades must yield a net gain.\n2. **Resource Scarcity & Abundance**: Prioritize trading away abundant low/mid-value resources (e.g., Sheep: 25 units) to acquire higher-value or scarcer resources (e.g., Wood: only 6 units).\n3. **Leverage Negotiation Dynamics**: A bad initial offer signals an opportunity to counter. Player 0 wants Ore (high-value), so I can redirect them to my surplus resources while minimizing Ore loss.\n4. **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid trading away high-value resources (Ore) for low-value ones (Wheat), as it permanently erodes value. Instead, seek mutually beneficial swaps.\n5. **Incremental Gains**: Start with small counter-offers to test willingness, using my most abundant resource (Sheep) to avoid big losses.\n\n### Trading Decision\n**Evaluation of Player 0's Offer**  \nPlayer 0 offers: **5 Wheat (total value = 25)** for **1 Ore (value = 40)**.  \n- **Net value impact**: 25 - 40 = **-15 loss**.  \n- **Risk**: Acquiring more Wheat (14 already) worsens inventory bloat of low-value resources.  \n**Conclusion**: This trade reduces my total value. Decline.\n\n**Counter-Offer Strategy**  \nI counter with:  \n- **Offering Sheep**: Highly abundant (25 units), medium value (16).  \n- **Requesting Wood**: Scarce for me (6 units), higher value per unit (11) than Wheat.  \nSpecific offer: **1 Sheep \u2192 2 Wood**.  \n- **My gain**: (2 Wood \u00d7 11) - (1 Sheep \u00d7 16) = 22 - 16 = **+6 net value**.  \n- **Why Player 0 might accept**: They may need Sheep (e.g., for game objectives) and have spare Wood.  \n\n**Action**: Reject initial offer and counter-propose to maximize my value.  \n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade should ideally result in a net gain in value. To calculate this, I need to know the individual value of each resource.\n2. **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:** I have a lot of Wheat (21) and Brick (24), which have relatively low and high values respectively. Ore (17) also has a high value. Wood (18) and Sheep (18) are mid-range. I should be more willing to trade away abundant, low-value resources for scarce, high-value resources.\n3. **Player 1's Rejection:** Player 1 rejected my offer of 5 Wheat for 1 Ore. This tells me a few things:\n    * Player 1 likely values Ore highly, or doesn't value Wheat as much as I do in that exchange.\n    * My offer of 5 Wheat for 1 Ore implies a personal value of 1 Ore > 5 * 6 = 30. Given Ore's actual value is 35, this was a good offer for me. It means Player 1 either needs Wheat less, or values Ore even higher, or thinks they can get a better deal.\n4. **Current Offer Analysis:** Player 1 is offering 1 Sheep (value 14) for 2 Wood (value 2 * 8 = 16). This is a net loss of 2 value for me. I should reject this offer unless there's a strategic reason (e.g., getting rid of Wood for a future trade, but currently, it's a loss).\n5. **Strategic Resource Acquisition:** Identify resources I want to acquire. Ore and Brick have the highest values. Acquiring more of these, especially if I can trade away lower-value goods for them, would be beneficial.\n6. **Negotiation Principles:**\n    * **Propose Win-Win Scenarios:** While I want to maximize my gain, the other player also wants to maximize theirs. A trade that offers some benefit to both parties is more likely to be accepted.\n    * **Anchor High/Low:** My initial offer was reasonable. Player 1's offer is a clear loss for me.\n    * **Understand Opponent's Needs (Inferred):** I don't know Player 1's resources or needs directly, but I can infer they value Ore given their rejection. Their offer for Wood suggests they might need Wood, or have surplus Sheep that they value less than Wood.\n    * **Be Patient/Persistence:** The game is 10 turns. There's time to find good trades.\n\nApplying Knowledge for Decision:\n* Player 1's offer: 1 Sheep (Value: 14) for 2 Wood (Value: 16).\n* My current resources after the previous turn (no change as my offer was rejected):\n    * Wheat: 21 (Value: 6)\n    * Wood: 18 (Value: 8)\n    * Sheep: 18 (Value: 14)\n    * Brick: 24 (Value: 27)\n    * Ore: 17 (Value: 35)\n* If I accept this offer, I gain 1 Sheep and lose 2 Wood. My total value changes by (1 * 14) - (2 * 8) = 14 - 16 = -2. This is a net loss in value.\n* Therefore, I should deny this offer. I should then propose a new offer that benefits me.\n* My goal is to increase total value. I have a lot of Wheat, which is low value. I want high-value resources like Ore and Brick.\n* Given Player 1 rejected 5 Wheat for 1 Ore, perhaps 1 Ore is too expensive for them to part with for that amount.\n* Maybe I can try to trade my abundant Wheat for something Player 1 might value more than the 5 Wheat they rejected, but still get a high-value resource.\n* What if I offer multiple lower-value resources for a single high-value resource?\n* Let's try to get more Ore or Brick.\n* 1 Ore is 35. 1 Brick is 27.\n* I have a lot of Wheat. 5 Wheat = 30.\n* Instead of trying to get 1 Ore for Wheat, let's try for Brick. Brick is also valuable.\n* 1 Brick is 27. I have 24 Brick.\n* What about trading something else for Ore? Maybe Sheep or Wood?\n* 2 Wood = 16. 3 Wood = 24. This could be closer to a Brick.\n* What if I target Brick since I have a lot of it and it's high value, and perhaps Player 1 needs something I have plenty of like Sheep or Wood, which they just offered to trade for.\n* Player 1 just offered 1 Sheep for 2 Wood, suggesting they might need Wood and have excess Sheep.\n* If they have excess Sheep and need Wood, maybe I can trade my Sheep for their Wood, but at a better rate for me, or use Sheep to get Ore/Brick.\n* Let's try to leverage the hint that Player 1 might need Wood.\n* If they need Wood, they might be willing to trade a higher-value resource for it.\n* My 2 Wood are worth 16. If I trade 2 Wood, I'd want something worth more than 16.\n* 1 Sheep for 2 Wood is a bad trade.\n* What if I offer something I have a LOT of and is low value, like Wheat, for something that is very high value like Ore? But not 5 Wheat. Maybe something less drastic?\n* How about 3 Wheat for 1 Sheep? My gain: 1 Sheep (14) - 3 Wheat (18) = -4. Bad.\n* Let's make an offer to maximize value for *me*.\n* I have lots of Wheat (35 value). I have lots of Brick (648 value).\n* I want to acquire more Ore (35 value).\n* If Player 1 rejected 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (35), they clearly want more for their Ore.\n* Let's offer a combination of lower value resources for 1 Ore.\n* 3 Wheat (18) + 1 Wood (8) = 26. Still less than 35 Ore.\n* What about 4 Wheat (24) for 1 Brick (27)? This would be a gain of 3 for me. My Wheat quantity is substantial, so trading 4 is fine. It's a plausible offer for Player 1 if they need Wheat.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. **Understand your current value:** Calculate the total value of your existing resources. This is your baseline. (21*6 + 18*8 + 18*14 + 24*27 + 17*35 = 126 + 144 + 252 + 648 + 595 = 1765)\n2. **Identify high-value resources:** Ore (35), Brick (27), Sheep (14), Wood (8), Wheat (6). Your goal is to acquire more high-value resources and divest low-value ones, but be careful not to overpay for them.\n3. **Analyze past offers (your own and opponent's):**\n    *   **Your rejected offers:**\n        *   `5 Wheat -> 1 Ore` (30 value -> 35 value). This was a good value proposition for you, but P1 rejected it. This suggests P1 either values Ore higher than 35 relative to Wheat, doesn't need Wheat, or thinks they can get a better deal.\n        *   `4 Wheat -> 1 Brick` (24 value -> 27 value). Another good value for you, rejected. Similar reasons as above. P1 seems to be valuing Brick highly or doesn't need Wheat.\n    *   **P1's rejected offers to you:**\n        *   `1 Sheep -> 2 Wood` (14 value -> 16 value). You rejected this, likely because you'd lose value or didn't need Wood.\n    *   **P1's current offer:** `2 Sheep -> 10 Wheat` (28 value -> 60 value). This is a *terrible* offer for you if you accept based purely on current values. You'd lose 32 value. P1 is trying to get a lot of cheap Wheat for a moderate amount of Sheep.\n4. **Determine trading ratios:** What are reasonable exchange rates for resources based on their base value? For example, 1 Ore (35) is roughly equivalent to 6 Wheat (36) or 4 Wood (32).\n5. **Evaluate desirability:** Do you have an abundance of low-value resources you'd like to get rid of (Wheat)? Do you need more high-value resources (Ore, Brick)?\n6. **Player's motivation (P1):** P1 seems to value Ore and Brick highly and is willing to offer Sheep for Wheat. This suggests they might be short on Wheat or need it for something specific, and they probably have a good supply of Sheep. They are also making offers that are highly unfavorable to you, suggesting they are trying to gain significant value.\n7. **Negotiation tactics:**\n    *   Don't accept offers that significantly decrease your total value.\n    *   Be persistent in making offers that increase your value.\n    *   Adjust your offers based on rejected offers. If your offers are being rejected, you might need to offer more of your resources or ask for less of theirs, or change the resource type.\n    *   Consider alternative high-value resource trades if direct trades for Ore/Brick are difficult.\n    *   It's early in the game (turn 3 of 10), so there's time to find good trades. Don't be desperate.\n    *   If P1 consistently offers bad deals, you might need to make slightly less aggressive offers to find a compromise, or switch which high-value resource you're targeting.\n\nPlayer 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 2 Sheep -> Requested items: 10 Wheat\n\nThis offer is 2 Sheep (2 * 14 = 28 value) for 10 Wheat (10 * 6 = 60 value). This is a net loss of 32 value for me. I should **Deny** this offer as it's highly detrimental.\n\nAfter denying, I need to make my own offer. My previous offers of Wheat for Brick/Ore were rejected. P1 is trying to get Wheat. This indicates P1 might need Wheat, but they are trying to get it very cheaply. I have a lot of Wheat (21). I want more high-value resources.\n\nLet's try to get Brick again, as I have a good quantity of it (24) and it's high value. My previous offer was 4 Wheat for 1 Brick (24 value for 27 value). P1 rejected this. Maybe I need to offer slightly more Wheat or a different resource they might value. P1 offered Sheep for Wheat, so they might have an abundance of Sheep.\n\nCould I offer Sheep for Brick? I have 18 Sheep.\n1 Brick = 27 value.\n2 Sheep = 28 value. This is a very close trade in terms of value. I would gain 1 in value for trading away 2 Sheep to gain 1 Brick.

Still offering low value for high value.\n    *   P1 Offer: 2 Sheep (28) -> 10 Wheat (60). Rejected. P1 requests a lot of my low-value resource for relatively little of their mid-value one.

I gain 7 value. I also acquire more of my highest-value resource (Ore) by giving away a mid-value resource I have in good quantity.

The 2 Sheep (28) for 1 Ore (35) is excellent.\n    *   To get 1 Brick (27), I'd ideally offer <27 value. Example: 2 Sheep (28) is slightly over. 3-4 Wood (24-32) or 4-5 Wheat (24-30).\n*   **Quantity vs. Value:** While I have many low-value items, offering too many of them might not be perceived as valuable enough by the other player, or it might deplete my stock too quickly if trades aren't reciprocated, or even result in slight value losses if misunderstood. Focus on good value ratios rather than just shedding quantity.\n*   **Player 1's Behavior:** Player 1 seems willing to trade Ore for Sheep. This is a positive for me. I should continue to capitalize on this if possible. They also seem willing to accept Wheat for Brick/Ore, they just want more of it than I initially offered.\n*   **Game State:** 10 turns total. I've accepted 2 good trades, now on the third. I need to keep making these profitable trades.\n\nDecision: The current offer from Player 1 (2 Sheep -> 1 Ore) is highly favorable to me. I should accept it.\n\n[Accept]",
