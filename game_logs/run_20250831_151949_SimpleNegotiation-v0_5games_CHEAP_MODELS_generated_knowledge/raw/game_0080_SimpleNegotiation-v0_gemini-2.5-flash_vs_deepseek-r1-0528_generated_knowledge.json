      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Understand Your Current Portfolio Value:** Calculate the total value of your current resources. This will serve as a baseline for evaluating potential trades.\n2.  **Identify High-Value Resources (to acquire) and Low-Value Resources (to trade away):** Look at your individual resource values. Your goal is to acquire more of higher-value resources and divest lower-value resources, provided the trade is net positive in value. Ore (32) and Brick (23) currently have the highest individual values. Wheat (6) and Wood (12) have the lowest.\n3.  **Prioritize Trades that Increase Total Value:** Every trade must result in a net increase in the total value of your holdings. A good trade involves giving away resources worth X and receiving resources worth Y, where Y > X.\n4.  **Consider Quantity and Scarcity:** While value per unit is important, consider the total quantity of resources. Having a diverse portfolio can be beneficial, but accumulating more of the highest-value resources is usually the primary goal.\n5.  **Formulate Asymmetric Offers:** Design offers where the value of what you receive is significantly higher than the value of what you give. This is the core of profitable trading.\n6.  **Be Prepared to Haggle (Implicitly):** Your first offer might not be accepted. Be ready to adjust your offer in subsequent turns if denied, aiming for a favorable compromise.\n7.  **Identify Trading Partners' Potential Needs/Wants (Hypothetical):** Though you don't know Player 1's inventory, you can assume they might value resources differently or have a surplus of certain resources you might want. Offering them common lower-value resources for higher-value ones could be a strategy.\n8.  **Avoid Trades that Decrease or Stagnate Value:** Do not accept or propose trades that do not clearly improve your total resource value.\n9.  **Strategic Use of \"Common\" Resources:** Resources like Wheat might be good for balancing trades because of their low individual value, allowing you to offer more units for higher-value items.\n\nCurrent Total Value:\nWheat: 12 * 6 = 72\nWood: 7 * 12 = 84\nSheep: 11 * 12 = 132\nBrick: 10 * 23 = 230\nOre: 23 * 32 = 736\nTotal Value = 72 + 84 + 132 + 230 + 736 = 1254\n\nTrading Decision:\nMy goal is to increase my total value from 1254. I have a large quantity of Ore, which is my highest value resource, and a decent quantity of Brick. Wheat has the lowest value per unit. I should try to trade away lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) for higher-value ones (Ore, Brick).\n\nLet's try to get more high-value resources. I want to trade away low-value resources.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (5 * 6 = 30) + 2 Wood (2 * 12 = 24) = 54 Value\nRequest: 1 Brick (1 * 23 = 23) + 1 Ore (1 * 32 = 32) = 55 Value\nThis is a small positive gain (55 vs 54), but it's a start and shifts towards higher-value resources. I have plenty of Wheat and my Ore/Brick quantities are good but can always be improved.\n\nLet's try a slightly bolder offer, targeting more significant value increase by leveraging my quantity of Wheat and Wood.\nI have a lot of Ore (23), but it's my most valuable. I should try to acquire more high-value resources.\n\nLet's try to trade away low-value resources for high-value resources. Wheat is only value 6.\nOffer: 10 Wheat (10 * 6 = 60) + 3 Wood (3 * 12 = 36) = 96 Value\nRequest: 3 Brick (3 * 23 = 69) + 1 Ore (1 * 32 = 32) = 101 Value\nThis gives a gain of 5 value. It also reduces my lowest Qty resource (Wood) slightly as well as my lowest value resource (Wheat).\n\nI'll make an offer that significantly leverages my lowest value resource (Wheat) and some Sheep for higher value items.\n\nOffer: 8 Wheat (8 * 6 = 48) + 4 Sheep (4 * 12 = 48) = 96 Value\nRequest: 3 Brick (3 * 23 = 69) + 1 Ore (1 * 32 = 32) = 101 Value\nThis seems like a fair and positive value trade.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 4 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge on Resource Trading and Negotiation:\n1. **Value Maximization Principle**: Prioritize trades that yield a net positive value gain, as the primary goal is to increase total resource value. Calculate the value difference using the per-unit value derived from current holdings.\n\n2. **Per-Unit Value Calculation**:  \n   - Wheat: Total 6 for value 6 \u2192 1.0 per unit  \n   - Wood: Total 7 for value 8 \u2192 ~1.143 per unit  \n   - Sheep: Total 10 for value 14 \u2192 1.4 per unit  \n   - Brick: Total 7 for value 22 \u2192 ~3.143 per unit  \n   - Ore: Total 18 for value 34 \u2192 ~1.889 per unit  \n\n3. **Strategic Resource Allocation**: \n   - **Scarcity vs. Abundance**: Brick has the highest per-unit value but is scarcer (only 7 units). Ore is abundant (18 units), making it less costly to trade away small quantities.\n   - **Diversification**: Avoid over-accumulating low-value resources (e.g., Wheat) unless net gain offsets long-term inefficiency. Focus on acquiring higher-value resources when possible.\n\n4. **Negotiation Tactics**: \n   - Accept offers with immediate net value gains, especially early in the game (turn 1 of 10), to build value for future negotiations.\n   - Weigh opportunity cost: Rejecting a profitable trade risks missing out if better offers don't materialize later.\n\n5. **Opponent Behavior**: Player 0 may undervalue Brick/Ore or overvalue Wheat/Sheep.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n*   **Understand Resource Values:** My primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. I need to be keenly aware of the per-unit value of each resource. Ore (32) and Brick (23) are my most valuable resources, while Wheat (6) is the least.\n*   **Identify Surplus and Deficit:** I have a high quantity of Ore (23) and Wheat (12). I have moderate quantities of Brick (10), Sheep (11), and Wood (7). While quantity doesn't directly dictate trade decisions, it can influence willingness to part with high-value items if I have many of them.\n*   **Target High-Value Acquisitions:** I should prioritize acquiring more of high-value resources like Ore and Brick, even if it means giving up multiple lower-value resources.\n*   **Strategic Bartering (Value Exchange):** Any trade I propose or accept should result in a net gain in value for me. Calculate the total value being offered versus the total value being requested.\n*   **Flexibility and Adaptation:** Be prepared to adjust my offers based on the other player's likely needs and perceived values. If a player rejects an offer, it indicates they value what I'm asking for more than what I'm offering, or value what I'm offering less than my valuation.\n*   **Information from Previous Turn:** Player 1 *accepted* my previous offer (8 Wheat, 4 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Ore). This indicates Player 1 either highly values Brick and Ore, or they saw net value in what I was offering. My gain was (3*23 + 1*32) - (8*6 + 4*12) = (69 + 32) - (48 + 48) = 101 - 96 = +5 value. This was a successful trade. Player 1 also didn't make a new offer, meaning it's still on me to initiate.\n*   **Maintain Scarcity:** While I have a lot of Ore, I shouldn't give it away cheaply since it's my most valuable resource.\n*   **Consider Opportunity Cost:** What else could I get for the resources I'm offering? Am I getting the best possible deal?\n\nMy current resources after the trade:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 12 - 8 = 4 Value: 6\n*   [Wood] Qty: 7 Value: 12\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 11 - 4 = 7 Value: 12\n*   [Brick] Qty: 10 + 3 = 13 Value: 23\n*   [Ore] Qty: 23 + 1 = 24 Value: 32\n\nTotal current value: (4*6) + (7*12) + (7*12) + (13*23) + (24*32) = 24 + 84 + 84 + 299 + 768 = 1259.\n\nMy previous total value was: (12*6) + (7*12) + (11*12) + (10*23) + (23*32) = 72 + 84 + 132 + 230 + 736 = 1254. My previous trade gained me 5 value, confirming the positive calculation.\n\nGiven my strong position in high-value resources (Ore and Brick), I should look to further consolidate these or trade my remaining low-value Wheat for higher-value items. I have very little Wheat left, so holding onto it isn't a problem, but trading it makes sense if I can gain value.\n\nI have an excess of Ore and Brick now, but they are my highest value resources. I should trade strategically, perhaps using some of my Ore to acquire other valuable resources or to gain substantial value from lower-value resources. I am still relatively low on Wood.\n\nTrading Strategy:\n1.  **Prioritize Net Value Gain:** Always ensure `Value(Requested) > Value(Offered)`.\n2.  **Utilize lower-value resources:** Try to trade the remaining Wheat if a good opportunity arises.\n3.  **Target Wood and Sheep:** I have a moderate amount of these, and while their value is decent (12), I might be able to trade some high-value Ore or Brick for a proportional amount of them if I desire more quantity, or trade them for even higher-value items.\n4.  **Leverage Ore:** Given I have 24 Ore, I can afford to use some to get better deals, but I must ensure the value exchange is always favorable.\n\nLet's try to trade some Ore and perhaps some Sheep for Wood and/or Brick.\nConsider an offer: 2 Ore (64 value) + 2 Sheep (24 value) = 88 value. What could I ask for?\nMaybe 3 Brick (69 value) + 2 Wood (24 value) = 93 value. This would be a 5-value gain.\nOr, I could aim to reduce my current largest stock (Ore) while gaining other resources.\n\nHow about: I offer some Ore (high quantity, high value) to get more of a relatively high-value resource I have less of, like Wood, or further increase my Brick count.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore (32 value) and 1 Wheat (6 value) = 38. Could I get 2 Wood (24 value) and 1 Sheep (12 value)? That would equal 36 value, so a slight loss. So this specific trade is bad.\n\nLet's rethink. I have a lot of Ore and a decent amount of Brick. I might want to diversify or simply gain pure value.\nMy lowest quantity is Wheat (4) and Wood (7).\nMy highest quantity is Ore (24) and Brick (13).\n\nI can offer some high-value Ore to get a mix of other resources or some more high-value resources.\nOffer: 2 Ore (64) + 1 Sheep (12) = 76 value.\nRequest: 3 Brick (69) + 1 Wood (12) = 81 value. This is a +5 value trade. This looks good. It reduces my high Ore count slightly, consolidates my Brick, and gets me a little more Wood.\n\n[Offer: 2 Ore, 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood]",

Trade analysis must prioritize net value gain (+\u0394V) above all else, as resource composition only matters for enabling future trades.\n2. **Marginal Utility Awareness**: High-value resources (Ore\u219234) offer exponential returns, making their acquisition desirable even when stockpiling, but only if trades have positive net value.\n3. **Scarcity Management**: Low-quantity resources require careful depletion. Trading away >50% of any resource risks limiting future flexibility unless value gain is substantial.\n4. **Bundle Evaluation**: Assess trades holistically\u2014individual resource values are secondary to the total package equilibrium.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade must result in a net gain in value. I should prioritize trading away lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or resources I have in abundance for those I lack or could use to acquire higher-value items.\n2. **Resource Scarcity/Abundance and Relative Value:** I have a lot of Ore (23 units, value 32 per unit) and Wheat (12 units, value 6 per unit). Wood (7 units, value 12) is relatively scarce for me. Brick (10 units, value 23) and Sheep (11 units, value 12) are in between. Given Ore's high individual value and my abundance, I should be cautious about trading it unless the return is exceptionally good. Wheat, with its low individual value, is a good candidate for trading away.\n3. **Player 1's Needs/Strategy (Inferred):** I don't know Player 1's resources or values. However, given their previous acceptance of Wheat/Sheep for Brick/Ore and rejection of Ore/Sheep for Brick/Wood, it suggests they value Brick and possibly Wood, and might be hesitant to give up Brick for less valuable resources, or might value Ore highly as well. They accepted Wheat and Sheep earlier, which are lower value for me, for Brick and Ore, which are higher value for me. This initial trade was favorable. The recent rejection of Ore and Sheep for Brick and Wood suggests my offer might have been perceived as unbalanced or that Player 1 did not value Brick or Wood enough to give them up for those resources.\n4. **Negotiation Leverage:** My abundance of Ore gives me potential leverage, but I need to be careful not to overvalue it or trade it away cheaply. My abundance of low-value Wheat means I can use it as filler or a foundation for trades.\n5. **Trade Ratios and Fair Value:** A good trade should aim for a higher value gained than value lost. For example, giving up 1 unit of Wheat (value 6) for 1 unit of Brick (value 23) is a huge gain. Giving up 1 unit of Ore (value 32) for 1 unit of Brick (value 23) is a loss. I need to calculate the value of both sides of the proposed trade.\n6. **Iterative Learning:** The previous trades provide data points. Player 1 accepted a trade where I gave away lower value resources for higher value ones. They rejected a trade where I offered higher value (Ore) for what they might consider equivalent or lower value (Brick, Wood), or simply that the ratio was unfavorable from their perspective. I need to adjust my future offers based on this feedback.\n7. **Scarcity and Demand:** Brick has proven to be a commonly requested resource (I requested it twice, and Player 1 gave it up once). This suggests it might be in higher demand, which could make it more valuable in trades.\n\nTrading Decision:\nMy last offer (2 Ore, 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood) was rejected. Let's analyze its value:\nOffered: (2 * 32 (Ore)) + (1 * 12 (Sheep)) = 64 + 12 = 76\nRequested: (3 * 23 (Brick)) + (1 * 12 (Wood)) = 69 + 12 = 81\nThis trade was a net gain of 5 value for me. Player 1 rejecting it suggests either:\n    a) Player 1 valued their Brick/Wood more than 81, or\n    b) Player 1 valued my Ore/Sheep less than 76, or\n    c) Player 1 did not want to trade Brick or Wood for my specified resources/quantities.\n\nGiven that Player 1 accepted Wheat/Sheep for Brick/Ore earlier, they are willing to trade Brick. My current inventory has a lot of Ore and Wheat. I want more Brick. My Wood is low.\n\nLet's try to leverage my high quantity of low-value Wheat and some average-value Sheep to get higher-value Brick and potentially some Wood. I want to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me in value, and potentially attractive to Player 1 by offering resources I have in abundance.\n\nLet's aim for Brick, and maybe Wood, without giving up too much Ore. I want to replenish my Wood if possible, but Brick is a higher priority due to its high value.\n\nConsider trading Wheat and Sheep for Brick.\nWhat if I offer a significant amount of low-value Wheat to get some high-value Brick?\n\nProposal:\nOffer: 8 Wheat, 3 Sheep\nValue Offered: (8 * 6) + (3 * 12) = 48 + 36 = 84\nRequest: 3 Brick, 2 Wood\nValue Requested: (3 * 23) + (2 * 12) = 69 + 24 = 93\n\nThis is a net gain of 9 for me. It offers a large quantity of Wheat, which I have in abundance, and some Sheep. It requests Brick and Wood, which are valuable to me and where I need to increase my quantity of Wood.\n\nLet's try a different combination, focusing on fewer resources in my offer, but still with a good value proposition.\nI have a lot of Ore. Can I trade a small amount of Ore for a lot of Brick?\n\nWhat about offering a combination of Ore (less quantity) and Sheep (more quantity) for Brick?\nOffer: 1 Ore, 6 Sheep\nValue Offered: (1 * 32) + (6 * 12) = 32 + 72 = 104\nRequest: 4 Brick\nValue Requested: (4 * 23) = 92\nThis is a net loss for me. Not good.\n\nLet's go back to high quantity of low value (Wheat) for high value (Brick).\nMy first offer was good (8 Wheat, 4 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Ore). Player 1 accepted that.\nValue Offered: (8 * 6) + (4 * 12) = 48 + 48 = 96\nValue Requested: (3 * 23) + (1 * 32) = 69 + 32 = 101\nNet gain: 5. This was accepted.\n\nMy last rejected offer: (2 Ore, 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick, 1 Wood)\nValue Offered: (2 * 32) + (1 * 12) = 64 + 12 = 76\nValue Requested: (3 * 23) + (1 * 12) = 69 + 12 = 81\nNet gain: 5. This was rejected.\n\nIt seems Player 1 might value Ore highly and doesn't want to give up Brick/Wood for it at that ratio, or they didn't need the Ore.\nPerhaps I should avoid offering Ore for a bit, or only for extremely high returns.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick using my Wheat and Sheep.\nWhat if I offer a similar value to the first accepted trade, but tweak the requested items?\n\nNew Offer:\nOffered items: 8 Wheat, 4 Sheep\nValue: (8 * 6) + (4 * 12) = 48 + 48 = 96\nRequested items: 4 Brick\nValue: (4 * 23) = 92\n\nThis is a net loss of 4 for me! I need a net gain.\n\nLet's try to get 3 Brick and something else.\nOffer: 8 Wheat, 3 Sheep\nValue: (8 * 6) + (3 * 12) = 48 + 36 = 84\nRequest: 3 Brick, 1 Wood\nValue: (3 * 23) + (1 * 12) = 69 + 12 = 81\nThis is a net loss of 3 for me.\n\nThe target is always to increase value.\nI have 12 Wheat, 7 Wood, 11 Sheep, 10 Brick, 23 Ore. Total Value = 12*6 + 7*12 + 11*12 + 10*23 + 23*32 = 72 + 84 + 132 + 230 + 736 = 1254.\n\nLet's aim for a trade with high value requested and lower value offered, specifically using Wheat.\nConsider getting 2 Brick and 1 Wood for a lot of Wheat.\nOffer: 10 Wheat, 2 Sheep\nValue: (10 * 6) + (2 * 12) = 60 + 24 = 84\nRequest: 2 Brick, 1 Wood\nValue: (2 * 23) + (1 * 12) = 46 + 12 = 58\nThis is a loss of 26 for me. Horrible.\n\nIt's hard to make a significant value gain if I only offer low-value resources for high-value ones, unless the quantities are very disproportionate.\nThe first trade was successful because I got Ore (very high value) and Brick for Wheat and Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get Ore from Player 1 again in exchange for something else, since it's the highest value resource.\nI have a ton of Ore. Maybe Player 1 needs more Wheat or Sheep.\nWhat if I offer Brick and Sheep for Ore? I want more Ore because it's the highest value. But I only have 10 Brick.\n\nLet's try to leverage my Ore abundance slightly, but only for higher value return.\nOffer: 1 Ore, 2 Sheep\nValue: (1 * 32) + (2 * 12) = 32 + 24 = 56\nRequest: 2 Brick, 1 Wood\nValue: (2 * 23) + (1 * 12) = 46 + 12 = 58\nThis is a gain of 2. It's small, and means giving up Ore and Sheep. Still, it nets a gain. However, Player 1 rejected an offer with 2 Ore. Offering 1 might still be problematic if they don't value it that much or don't need it.\n\nLet's go back to the idea of trading my lowest value resource (Wheat) for high value ones.\nWhat if I offer a massive amount of Wheat for Brick and Ore.\nMy last accepted trade included Ore from Player 1.\nOffer: 10 Wheat, 6 Sheep\nValue: (10 * 6) + (6 * 12) = 60 + 72 = 132\nRequest: 2 Brick, 2 Ore\nValue: (2 * 23) + (2 * 32) = 46 + 64 = 110\nThis is a huge loss (22 points).\n\nThis is tricky. I need to make a value-positive trade *from my perspective* that Player 1 might also perceive as positive *from their perspective*.\nThe rejection of my last Ore/Sheep offer for Brick/Wood implies Player 1 didn't see the value for them in that specific trade.\n\nLet's refine my approach:\n1. Prioritize trades that give me Brick or Ore, as they have the highest individual values.\n2. Utilize my abundant Wheat, which has the lowest individual value, as the primary resource offered.\n3. Be cautious with offering Ore unless the return is clearly excellent, and avoid it if Player 1 has shown reluctance to trade for it.\n4. Aim for a distinct value gain for myself, even if small, while making the offer appealing to Player 1 (e.g., offering resources they might need or offering higher quantities of specific resources).\n\nLet's assume Player 1 wants Brick (since I've asked for it, and they've given it up, and I rejected an offer where they might have asked for it).\nWhat if I offer Sheep and Wheat for Brick? I have 11 Sheep.\n\nOffer: 6 Sheep, 6 Wheat\nValue: (6 * 12) + (6 * 6) = 72 + 36 = 108\nRequest: 3 Brick, 1 Wood\nValue: (3 * 23) + (1 * 12) = 69 + 12 = 81\nThis is a significant loss (27) for me.\n\nThe challenge is getting high value resources (Brick, Ore) for lower value resources (Wheat, Sheep) in a way that Player 1 accepts. The first trade worked.\n\nLet's try to replicate the 'feel' of the first accepted offer (Wheat + Sheep for Brick + Ore).\nThe first offer was 8 Wheat, 4 Sheep (value 96) for 3 Brick, 1 Ore (value 101). Net gain of 5.\n\nWhat if I ask for 2 Brick, 1 Ore?\nValue: (2 * 23) + (1 * 32) = 46 + 32 = 78\nTo get a gain, I need to offer less than 78.\nOffer: 7 Wheat, 2 Sheep\nValue: (7 * 6) + (2 * 12) = 42 + 24 = 66\nThis is a gain of 12. This seems like a strong offer for me. Would Player 1 accept? It's asking for high-value items, offering lower-value ones. The quantities are 9 offered for 3 requested. This might be seen as a good deal for Player 1 due to quantity exchange, and good for me due to value exchange.\n\nLet's propose this, as it aligns with previous acceptance patterns (offering Wheat/Sheep for Brick/Ore) and provides a significant value increase for me.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]",

I should aim to acquire more of Ore and Brick, and be willing to part with Wheat if the trade is favorable.\n3.  **Identify Low-Value Resources (for me):** Wheat is my lowest value resource. This makes it the primary candidate for offering in trades, especially when acquiring higher-value resources.\n4.  **Calculate Trade Profitability:** For every potential trade, calculate the value of what I offer and what I request. The requested value must be significantly higher than the offered value for a trade to be worthwhile.\n    *   Value of Offered Resources < Value of Requested Resources.\n5.  **Look for Opportunities to Convert Low to High:** My best strategy is to trade away low-value resources (like Wheat) to gain high-value resources (like Ore or Brick).\n6.  **Assess Past Trades:**\n    *   Previous Trade 1: Offered 8 Wheat (8*6=48), 4 Sheep (4*12=48) -> Requested 3 Brick (3*23=69), 1 Ore (1*32=32).\n        *   Offered Value: 48 + 48 = 96\n        *   Requested Value: 69 + 32 = 101\n        *   Profit: 101 - 96 = 5.

Offering high-value resources (Ore) for only a small profit might not be accepted, especially if Player 1 also needs or values Ore. I have a large quantity of Ore (24), so I *can* afford to trade it, but only for significant gains.\n7.  **Consider Player 1's Perspective (Hypothesis):** Player 1 might also be trying to increase their total value, and might have different resource valuations or needs. They rejected the trade where I offered Ore, suggesting they either value Ore highly or the requested items weren't attractive enough for the Ore I was offering.\n8.  **Strategy moving forward:**\n    *   Focus on trading my remaining Wheat (Qty 4) for higher-value resources.\n    *   Be cautious about offering Ore unless the profit margin is substantial, or it helps me acquire critically needed resources (if my quantities were low, which they are not for now).\n    *   Explore trades involving Wood or Sheep, as they are mid-value resources that I have a decent quantity of (7 Sheep, 7 Wood) and might be desired by Player 1.\n    *   Aim for significant value increases. A profit of 5 is okay, but I should aim for more.\n\nTrading Decision:\nMy current resources: Wheat: 4, Wood: 7, Sheep: 7, Brick: 13, Ore: 24.\nI initiated the last two trades. Player 1 has not made any offers. This implies I need to be proactive.\nI have a low quantity of Wheat left (4). I want to shed it for high value.\nI have a high quantity of Ore (24) and Brick (13). I want more of these.\nLet's try to offer my low-value Wheat and some Sheep for high-value Brick/Ore.\n\nOffer: 4 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore\nValue of Offer: (4 * 6) + (2 * 12) = 24 + 24 = 48\nValue of Request: (2 * 23) + (1 * 32) = 46 + 32 = 78\nProfit: 78 - 48 = 30. This is a significant profit. It's a bold offer trying to offload all my remaining wheat and get high-value items.\n\nIf this is too aggressive, I can try a smaller, more balanced offer, perhaps involving Wood.\nLet's consider another option focused on consolidating my high-value resources.\n\nOffer: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore\nValue of Offer: (3 * 12) + (2 * 12) = 36 + 24 = 60\nValue of Request: (2 * 23) + (1 * 32) = 46 + 32 = 78\nProfit: 78 - 60 = 18. This is still a good profit and involves mid-value items.\n\nGiven Player 1 accepted my first offer (small profit for me) but rejected the second (small profit for me, but I offered high-value Ore), I need to be careful with the balance. Offloading low-value Wheat makes sense.\n\nLet's go for the first, more aggressive offer involving Wheat, as it totally removes my lowest value resource. If it gets rejected, I can recalibrate.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore]",

This means any trade should ideally result in a net gain in value.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** Be clear on the individual value of each resource.

This dictates how much I should be willing to give up for desired resources.\n3.  **Surplus Identification:** Identify resources I have in abundance or those with lower individual value. Wheat (12 total, lowest value per unit) is a good candidate for offering. Wood (7 total) is also relatively low. Ore (23 total, highest value) is high in quantity, but also high in value, so I should be careful not to unnecessarily give it up at a loss.\n4.  **Deficit Identification/Target Resources:** Identify resources I need or those that would significantly increase my total value, especially if I can acquire them cheaply. Brick (10 total, high value per unit) is a good target.\n5.  **Strategic Small Trades:** Multiple small, value-positive trades can be better than holding out for one large trade, especially if turns are limited.\n6.  **Understanding Opponent Behavior (Implicit):** Player 1 previously accepted a trade where I offered Wheat/Sheep for Brick/Ore, which was favorable to me. They rejected my subsequent offers unless it was 2 Ore for 3 Brick, 1 Wood (where I gained significantly). They just offered 2 Ore for 2 Brick. This suggests Player 1 values Brick highly, potentially more than I do, and is willing to pay my high-value Ore for it. They might be trying to accumulate Brick.\n7.  **Evaluating Offers:** Player 1's current offer: \"Offered items: 2 Ore -> Requested items: 2 Brick\".\n    *   Value of 2 Ore = 2 * 32 = 64\n    *   Value of 2 Brick = 2 * 23 = 46\n    *   This trade would result in a *loss* of 18 value (64 - 46 = 18). This is not optimal for value maximization.\n8.  **Negotiation Strategy:** Decline offers that result in a net loss. Counter with offers that are value-positive for me, even if slightly unfavorable to the opponent, or at least less unfavorable than their offers to me. Since Player 1 is offering Ore for Brick, they might be desperate for Brick. I have 10 Brick. I should leverage this by demanding a better return for my high-value Ore or offering my lower-value resources for their desirable ones.\n\nTrading Decision:\nPlayer 1's offer is 2 Ore (Value 64) for 2 Brick (Value 46). This is a significant loss of value for me. I should reject it and counter. Player 1 seems to value Brick highly and has rejected offers where I gain significantly. I want more Brick or Ore, but I also have plenty of Ore. I want to convert some of my lower-value resources into higher-value ones, or at least maintain value.\n\nConsidering Player 1's pattern, they are trying to get Brick. I have 10 Brick. I don't want to give up my high-value Ore without a significant return. I still want more Brick. I also have plenty of Wheat and Sheep.

They prioritize Brick acquisition but undervalue Ore.  \n\n**Action**: Reject. A 0.52 gain is marginal, and Brick should be preserved for larger profits or Ore trades instead of flooding my inventory with low-yield resources.  \n\n**Counter-Offer Strategy**:  \nPropose a high-value trade using my Ore surplus for Player 0\u2019s Brick:  \n> `[Offer: 3 Ore, 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick]`  \n- **Value Calculation**:  \n  - Give: 3 Ore (\u22485.67) + 1 Sheep (1.4) \u2248 **7.07 total given**.  \n  - Receive: 3 Brick \u2248 **9.42 total received**.  \n  Net gain: `9.42 - 7.07 = 2.35` (highly favorable).  \n- **Rationale**:  \n  Ore is less valuable to me (surplus of 18) but appealing to Player 0 (past Ore requests). This leverages their Brick demand while securing a large gain.\n\n**[Deny]**  \n**New Trade Offer**: [Offer: 3 Ore, 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: \n*   **Identify High-Value Resources:** Ore and Brick are currently my highest-value resources. I should prioritize acquiring more of these or trading lower-value resources for them.\n*   **Identify Low-Value Resources:** Wheat and Wood are my lowest-value resources.

They also rejected an offer with 2 Ore (64) + 1 Sheep (12) for 3 Brick (69) + 1 Wood (12), which was 76 vs 81, a slight gain for me. They also rejected 4 Wheat (24) + 2 Sheep (24) for 2 Brick (46) + 1 Ore (32), which was 48 vs 78 (a good deal for me). Most recently, they offered 3 Ore (96) + 1 Sheep (12) for 3 Brick (69), which is them losing value (108 vs 69). This suggests they might be trying to gain Brick or perhaps offload Ore for some reason.\n*   **Consider Resource Ratios:** My Ore is very high (23), and Brick is decent (10).

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade I make should result in a net gain in value. I need to calculate the value of both what I offer and what I request.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** Each resource has a specific value. I must use these values consistently in my calculations.\n    *   Wheat: 6\n    *   Wood: 12\n    *   Sheep: 12\n    *   Brick: 23\n    *   Ore: 32\n3.  **Identify Under/Over-valued Resources for Trade:**\n    *   **High Value/Qty:** Ore (32) is my most valuable resource and I have a significant quantity (23). Brick (23) is also valuable.\n    *   **Low Value/Qty:** Wheat (6) is my least valuable resource and I have a moderate quantity (12). Wood (12) and Sheep (12) are mid-value.\n    *   This suggests I should ideally trade away lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or higher-value resources I have in surplus for other high-value resources I need, provided I ensure a net value gain.\n4.  **Strategic Resource Acquisition:** I want more Brick and Ore, as they have the highest values. Wood and Sheep are mid-value, Wheat is low.\n5.  **Negotiation Posture from Past Turns:**\n    *   I successfully traded 8 Wheat (48) + 4 Sheep (48) = 96 for 3 Brick (69) + 1 Ore (32) = 101. This was a profitable trade (+5 value).\n    *   My subsequent offers (2 Ore + 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick + 1 Wood, and 4 Wheat + 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick + 1 Ore, 4 Wheat + 2 Sheep -> 2 Brick) were rejected. This indicates my requests were too high, or my offers too low, in the eyes of Player 1.\n    *   Player 1 rejected my offers but their counter-offers (2 Ore -> 2 Brick, 3 Ore + 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick) were rejected by me. This shows we are both trying to get good deals and are perhaps valuing resources differently or are being aggressive.\n    *   Player 1's offer of 2 Ore (64) -> 2 Brick (46) was a net loss for me (-18), so rightly rejected.\n    *   Player 1's offer of 3 Ore (96) + 1 Sheep (12) = 108 -> 3 Brick (69) was also a significant net loss for me (-39), so rightly rejected. Player 1 seems to consistently make offers that are losses for me.\n6.  **Adaptation & Learning:** Player 1 has consistently rejected offers where I try to offload Wheat or Sheep for Brick/Ore, *unless* it's a very good deal for them or balanced. They have also tried to get my high-value Ore for their lower-value Brick. This confirms they value Brick highly and perhaps need Ore.\n7.  **Offer Structure:** My offers need to be attractive enough for Player 1 to accept, while still providing a net gain for me. Since Player 1 is keen on Brick and seems willing to give up Ore (or wants my Ore), I might try to leverage that. I need to be careful with my Ore.\n\nTrading Decision:\nMy past offers for Wheat/Sheep for Brick/Ore have been rejected when the value difference wasn't sufficiently skewed in Player 1's favor. Player 1 has shown a desire for my Ore, but consistently offers unfavorable trades where I lose significant value. I need to be cautious about giving up too much Ore unless the return in Brick or other valuable resources is exceptionally good.\n\nGiven Player 1's consistent rejections unless they get a very good deal, I should try to make an offer where I offer resources that are less valuable to me (or I have in excess) for more valuable resources, ensuring a positive value gain.\nI have a good amount of Ore, but it's my most valuable resource, so I want to be careful with it. Brick is also valuable. Wheat, Wood, and Sheep are less valuable.\n\nLet's try to offload some Wheat and Sheep, potentially combined with a small amount of Wood, for Brick or Ore. I have 12 Wheat, 7 Wood, 11 Sheep.\nMy last accepted trade involved giving up a much higher value of Wheat/Sheep for Brick/Ore. Perhaps Player 1 is looking for something similar again.\n\nPrevious successful trade for estimation: 8 Wheat (48) + 4 Sheep (48) = 96 for 3 Brick (69) + 1 Ore (32) = 101. Net +5.\n\nLet's try to offer a mix of lower-value resources for a good return in high-value resources. Wheat has the lowest value. Let's try to get more Brick, as it's the next highest value resource after Ore.\n\nConsider: 5 Wheat (30) + 2 Sheep (24) = 54\nRequest: 2 Brick (46). This is too low for me (54 offering for 46 requesting).\nWhat if I add Wood?\n5 Wheat (30) + 2 Sheep (24) + 1 Wood (12) = 66\nRequest: 2 Brick (46) + 1 Ore (32) = 78. Net +12 for me. Total value 66 for 78. This seems like a good deal for me, and possibly attractive enough for Player 1 given that I'm offering a few different resources.\n\nMy current resources:\nWheat: 12 (6)\nWood: 7 (12)\nSheep: 11 (12)\nBrick: 10 (23)\nOre: 23 (32)\n\nIf I offer 5 Wheat, 2 Sheep, 1 Wood:\nWheat left: 7\nSheep left: 9\nWood left: 6\nIf I get 2 Brick, 1 Ore:\nBrick: 12\nOre: 24\n\nThis moves my resources towards higher value ones.\n\nLet's check Player 1's typical requests. They seem to want Ore. My last rejected offer for 4 Wheat (24) + 2 Sheep (24) = 48 for 2 Brick (46) was very close to even for me (net -2, so I'd want positive). Player 1 still rejected it. This suggests they want a better deal for themselves or don't want Wheat/Sheep.\n\nHowever, Player 1 has also offered their Ore for my Brick or vice-versa. They seem to value Brick highly.\n\nGiven all the rejections for offers involving Wheat and Sheep, I should consider if Player 1 truly values them highly for trading with high-value resources. What if I try to get one high value resource for another?\n\nFor example, I have a lot of Ore. Could I trade some Ore for Brick?\nOffer: 1 Ore (32)\nRequest: 2 Brick (46). Net +14 for me. This is profitable for me. It might be appealing to Player 1 if they want Ore, and 1 high-value for 2 high-value is straightforward. They did offer 2 Ore for 2 Brick, which was terrible for me. Maybe a smaller exchange is more palatable for them.\n\nLet's try to secure a valuable gain. Given their consistent rejections, I need to make an offer that provides a clear gain for me, but is also attractive or at least not awful for Player 1.\nPlayer 1 rejected 4 Wheat (24) + 2 Sheep (24) = 48. Requested 2 Brick (46) + 1 Ore (32) = 78. This was a net of +30 for me, maybe too aggressive.\n\nLet's retry something simple with a positive gain for me.\nMy resources: Wheat: 12(6), Wood: 7(12), Sheep: 11(12), Brick: 10(23), Ore: 23(32)\n\nOffer: 3 Wheat (18) + 1 Wood (12) = 30\nRequest: 1 Brick (23) + 1 Sheep (12) = 35. Net +5. This is good for me. I gain Sheep back that I would have offered. It still tries to move low value resources (Wheat) for higher value.\n\nOr, to get more Brick/Ore:\nOffer: 5 Wheat (30) + 3 Sheep (36) = 66\nRequest: 3 Brick (69). Net +3 for me. This is a small gain, which might make it more acceptable. I am getting rid of 8 low-mid value items for 3 high value items.\n\nLet's go with the gain of +3, as it's a smaller margin, and might be accepted. It still puts me ahead and simplifies my inventory by reducing my quantity of less valuable resources.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 3 Brick]",
