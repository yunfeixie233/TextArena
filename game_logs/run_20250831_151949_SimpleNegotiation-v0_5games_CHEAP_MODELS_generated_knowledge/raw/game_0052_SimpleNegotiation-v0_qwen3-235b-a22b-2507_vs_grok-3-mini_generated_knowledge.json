      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: In this game, resources have explicit individual values:  \n   - Ore (35) > Brick (25) > Sheep (14) > Wood (12) > Wheat (6)  \n   This means Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick. Wheat is the least valuable. Prioritize acquiring high-value resources (Ore, Brick) and avoid giving them away unless compensated appropriately.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost & Marginal Utility**: Having large quantities of low-value resources relative to their worth (e.g., 18 Wheat at value 6) means their utility is limited unless traded for higher-value items. Conversely, surplus high-value resources (Ore: 25) might be used strategically in trades to gain undervalued returns if another player needs them more acutely.\n\n3. **Trade Efficiency**: The goal is to *increase total value*, so any trade should satisfy:  \n   Total value of received resources > Total value of given resources  \n   This ensures a positive net gain per trade.\n\n4. **Scarcity and Demand**: If a player holds a large amount of a high-value resource (like Ore), they can leverage it in trades \u2014 others may be willing to offer more in value to obtain it. However, since we have 25 Ore (maximum), others might expect us to trade it \u2014 but we should not undervalue it.\n\n5. **Surplus and Deficit Analysis**:  \n   - High stock in Brick (21), Ore (25), and Wheat (18) suggests we can afford to trade these if value is gained.  \n   - Lower in Sheep (14) and Wood (23) \u2014 Wood is decent in quantity but low in value.  \n   Sheep are mid-tier in value (14) \u2014 moderate stock.  \n   Thus, we can potentially trade surplus Wheat and Brick for higher-value items like Ore (though we already have a lot) or possibly trade Ore *for* Brick if undervalued elsewhere, but this seems suboptimal.\n\n6. **Trade Strategy**:  \n   - **Best Opportunity**: Trade low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) for high-value ones (Brick, Ore).  \n   - **Avoid**: Giving away high-value resources (Ore, Brick) for lower ones unless in surplus and receiving large quantities.  \n   - **Favor imbalanced offers**: If a player offers high-value resources for low-value ones, consider accepting or countering.  \n\n7. **Initiative**: Since no offer has been made yet, we should make the first offer to control the terms and steer the negotiation toward value-positive exchanges.\n\n8. **Example Trade Calculation**:  \n   Offering: 5 Wheat (5\u00d76 = 30) and 2 Wood (2\u00d712 = 24) \u2192 Total value given = 54  \n   Requesting: 3 Brick (3\u00d725 = 75) \u2192 Value gained = 75  \n   Net gain = +21 \u2192 Favorable.\n\nThus, we can craft high-quantity, low-unit-value offers to receive fewer but higher-value resources.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are relevant to my current situation as Player 1. First, **value maximization** is crucial: I should only accept trades that result in a net increase in the total value of my resources, based on the assigned values (e.g., Wheat = 5, Wood = 8, Sheep = 14, Brick = 24, Ore = 34). This involves calculating the incoming and outgoing values to ensure a positive gain, as pursuing trades with negative net value could weaken my position over the game's 10 turns.\n\nSecond, **resource scarcity and prioritization** plays a role: I have limited quantities of high-value resources like Brick (only 5 qty at 24 value each), so I should be cautious about trading them away unless the return is substantial. Conversely, I have abundant resources like Wheat (24 qty), which I can leverage as \"cheap\" trade bait to acquire more valuable items.\n\nThird, **negotiation strategy** includes rejecting unfavorable offers and countering with alternatives: If an incoming offer doesn't benefit me, I should deny it and propose a counter-offer that tilts the value in my favor, while considering the opponent's potential needs. This promotes long-term gains and avoids opportunity costs, such as depleting key resources early.\n\nFourth, **risk and opportunity assessment** is important: With only 10 turns, I need to balance immediate trades with future opportunities, avoiding over-trading scarce resources. Finally, **information asymmetry** suggests I shouldn't reveal weaknesses; instead, focus on deals that align with my abundance (e.g., Wheat) to acquire what I lack or value highly.\n\nThese principles apply here, as I'm dealing with an incoming offer that must be evaluated for net value before deciding.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision\n\nApplying the above knowledge, I first evaluate Player 0's offer: They want to give me 5 Wheat and 2 Wood in exchange for 3 Brick.\n\n- Value of incoming resources: 5 Wheat (5 qty \u00d7 5 value = 25) + 2 Wood (2 qty \u00d7 8 value = 16) = Total incoming value of 41.\n- Value of outgoing resources: 3 Brick (3 qty \u00d7 24 value = 72).\n- Net value change: 41 (incoming) - 72 (outgoing) = -31, which is a loss.\n\nThis offer violates the principle of value maximization, as it results in a net loss and depletes my scarce Brick resource. Additionally, it doesn't align with resource scarcity prioritization, since I'm giving up high-value Brick for lower-value items I already have in abundance (e.g., Wheat).\n\nGiven this, I will deny the offer. To advance my strategy, I'll counter with my own offer, leveraging my excess Wheat (which has low value to me) to potentially acquire something more valuable, like Brick from Player 0, on terms that ensure a net gain for me. For example, I'll propose trading 5 Wheat for 1 Brick, which provides me a slight net gain (5 Wheat = 25 value vs. 1 Brick = 24 value) while testing Player 0's interest.\n\nThis decision supports long-term negotiation by keeping my high-value resources intact and using my abundance to build better deals.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nBased on my current situation in the Negotiation Game, here are the key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are most relevant:\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: The primary goal is to ensure that any trade increases the total value of my resources. I must calculate the net value gain by comparing the value of resources I offer versus what I receive. For example, if I offer resources worth 50 total value and receive resources worth 70, I've gained 20 value. This is crucial because the game is competitive, and I should only proceed with trades that objectively benefit me.\n\n2. **Resource Scarcity and Abundance**: I have abundant resources like Wheat (24 qty) and moderate Wood (9 qty), which have lower values (5 and 8 respectively), making them good candidates to offer in trades. In contrast, I have limited but high-value resources like Brick (5 qty, value 24) and Ore (13 qty, value 34), so I should be cautious about trading these unless I get significantly more value in return. Additionally, from past interactions, Player 0 seems interested in Brick (they offered for it), indicating it might be scarce for them, giving me leverage.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics**: In a turn-limited game (only 10 turns total), I should be assertive but strategic\u2014start with offers that strongly favor me to test the waters, then adjust based on rejections. Avoid revealing too much weakness; for instance, don't over-trade high-value items like Brick unless the return is substantial. Learn from history: My previous offer (5 Wheat for 1 Brick) was rejected, suggesting Player 0 values Brick highly and wants a better deal, so I should counter by demanding more from their abundant resources (e.g., Wheat). Common tactics include bundling low-value items to make offers more appealing and aiming for win-win perceptions, even if I'm maximizing my gains.\n\n4. **Risk and Turn Management**: With only a few turns left, I need to avoid wasteful offers that get rejected repeatedly. If an offer is denied, it uses a turn, so proposals should be realistic but still advantageous. Monitor patterns: Player 0 has rejected my offers and made none recently, indicating they might be defensive or waiting, so I should pressure them with a strong counteroffer.\n\n5. **Psychological Insights**: People (or AI players) often anchor on their initial positions, so building on past offers (e.g., they wanted Brick, I offered Wheat) can help. However, always prioritize my valuation over theirs to stay competitive.\n\nThese principles guide me to focus on trading my excess low-value resources for high-value ones, ensuring a net gain while adapting to Player 0's behavior.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision\n\nApplying the above knowledge, I'll evaluate my resources and past interactions:\n\n- My resources: Wheat (abundant, low value) and Wood are expendable, while Brick and Ore are high-value and should be traded sparingly.\n- Past offers: Player 0 offered 5 Wheat and 2 Wood (total value: 5*5 + 2*8 = 25 + 16 = 41) for 3 Brick (value: 3*24 = 72), which was a poor deal for me (net loss of 31 value), so I rejected it. I then offered 5 Wheat (value: 25) for 1 Brick (value: 24), which was nearly even but still a slight loss for me, and it was rejected\u2014indicating Player 0 wants more incentive to trade their Brick.\n- Opportunity: Player 0 likely has excess Wheat (based on their offer), so I can target that. I'll offer 1 Brick (value: 24), which they want, in exchange for a larger quantity of Wheat (e.g., 10 Wheat, value: 50), giving me a net gain of 26 value. This aligns with value maximization and uses my scarcity (Brick) to my advantage.\n\nThis trade increases my total resource value, leverages Player 0's interest, and fits the turn-limited strategy. I'll proceed with this offer.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 10 Wheat]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nBefore making a trading decision, I'll outline key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are relevant to my current situation as Player 1. This is based on standard negotiation tactics in resource-based games, adapted to my resources and the game's context.\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: The core principle is to only trade if the total value of resources I receive exceeds the value of what I give up. My resources have assigned values (e.g., Wheat at 5 per unit), so I should calculate net value gain for every potential trade. For instance, I have an abundance of low-value resources like Wheat (24 units at 5 value each), which I can leverage to acquire higher-value items like Brick (24 value) or Ore (34 value) without depleting my strengths.\n\n2. **Resource Scarcity and Abundance**: I should trade excess resources (e.g., Wheat and Wood) for those that are scarcer or more valuable to me. I have high quantities of Wheat (24) and Ore (13), but low quantities of Brick (5) and Sheep (5). Meanwhile, Player 0 has shown interest in Brick (from their past offers), suggesting they might value it highly. This asymmetry can be exploited by offering what they want in exchange for what I need, but I must ensure the trade doesn't leave me vulnerable.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics and History**: Past interactions show Player 0 has rejected my offers (e.g., 5 Wheat for 1 Brick and 1 Brick for 10 Wheat), indicating they prioritize Brick and may undervalue Wheat. I should adjust offers to be more appealing by balancing fairness and aggression\u2014start with a slightly favorable deal for them to build rapport, but always aim for my net gain. With only 10 turns total and several already used, I need to be proactive to avoid stagnation, but avoid desperation by not overcommitting high-value resources like Ore.\n\n4. **Risk and Opportunity Cost**: Every trade has risks, such as revealing preferences or strengthening the opponent. I should consider the opportunity cost of holding onto resources versus trading them. For example, if I don't trade Wheat now, I might miss out on acquiring higher-value items later. Additionally, since Player 0 made no new offer, I should initiate to control the pace.\n\n5. **Psychological Insights**: In negotiations, offers should signal confidence and value. By offering resources Player 0 wants (like Brick), I can encourage counteroffers. However, I must protect high-value assets (e.g., Ore at 34 value) and avoid trades that result in a net loss.\n\nOverall Insight: Prioritize trades that increase my total resource value (currently around 824 based on per-unit calculations), leverage my excesses (Wheat, Wood), and adapt to Player 0's preferences while maintaining a strategic edge in this limited-turn game.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge, I'll evaluate my situation: Player 0 has consistently shown interest in Brick, as seen in their initial offer (5 Wheat and 2 Wood for 3 Brick). My previous offer of 1 Brick for 10 Wheat was rejected, suggesting they value Brick more than I do relative to Wheat. To maximize value, I should offer Brick (high value to them) in exchange for resources like Wood or Wheat (which I have in abundance and can afford to part with), ensuring a net gain for me.\n\n- **Proposed Trade Calculation**: I'll offer 1 Brick (value: 24) in exchange for 5 Wood (value: 5 * 8 = 40) and 2 Wheat (value: 2 * 5 = 10 from Player 0, but since Wheat is abundant for me, this is acceptable as bait). Net value gain: Receiving 40 (Wood) + 10 (Wheat) = 50, minus giving 24 (Brick) = +26 value. This aligns with value maximization and uses historical insights to make the offer more attractive.\n\nThis decision is proactive, builds on past rejections, and keeps the game moving without risking my high-value Ore.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 5 Wood, 2 Wheat]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge on Resource Trading and Negotiation\n\nBased on my current situation, here are the key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are most relevant:\n\n1. **Value-Based Decision Making**: Always prioritize trades that increase the total value of my resources based on my personal valuations. For instance, my resources have the following per-unit values: Wheat (5), Wood (8), Sheep (14), Brick (24), and Ore (34). I should only accept or propose trades where the total value of resources I receive exceeds the total value of resources I give up. This ensures long-term gains, especially in a limited 10-turn game.\n\n2. **Assess Scarcity and Abundance**: I have an abundance of Wheat (24 qty) and a reasonable amount of Wood (9 qty), which are lower-value resources, making them good candidates for trading. In contrast, I have limited Brick (5 qty) and Sheep (5 qty), and a solid stock of high-value Ore (13 qty). I should leverage my excess low-value resources (like Wheat) to acquire higher-value ones (like more Brick) while protecting scarce or high-value assets like Ore.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics and History Analysis**: From the game history, Player 0 has repeatedly tried to acquire Brick (a high-value resource for me) by offering Wheat and Wood, but their offers have been unbalanced in my favor (e.g., their initial offer of 5 Wheat and 2 Wood for 3 Brick equated to a net loss for me: 41 value given vs. 72 value received). My previous offers, such as 5 Wheat for 1 Brick (a net gain for me: 25 value given vs. 24 value received), were rejected, indicating Player 0 may value Brick highly or have different valuations. I should adjust offers slightly to make them more appealing while maintaining a net gain, such as increasing the quantity of low-value items I offer. Persistence is key, but I must avoid over-giving to prevent losses.\n\n4. **Risk and Opportunity Cost**: With only 10 turns remaining, I need to be efficient and avoid risky trades that don't yield immediate value increases. Every trade has an opportunity cost\u2014e.g., trading away Wheat now could limit future options\u2014so I should focus on small, calculated offers that test Player 0's boundaries without depleting my resources. If an offer is rejected, I can iterate based on patterns.\n\n5. **Psychological and Strategic Insights**: In negotiations, starting with fair or slightly favorable offers (from my perspective) can build rapport and encourage counteroffers. Since Player 0 has rejected my past offers, I should refine them to be more attractive, such as offering more of my abundant resources for their desired ones. Aim for win-win scenarios, but always prioritize my gains, as the game is competitive.\n\n### Application of Knowledge to Trading Decision\n\nApplying the above principles, I evaluate my current resources and game history:\n- I have an excess of Wheat (low value: 5 per unit), which I can use to target Brick (high value: 24 per unit), as Player 0 has shown interest in it.\n- My previous offer of 5 Wheat for 1 Brick provided a slight net gain (25 value given vs. 24 value received), but it was rejected. To make it more appealing while still ensuring a gain, I could stick with a similar structure but ensure it's defensible.\n- Calculating a new offer: Offering 5 Wheat (total value: 25) for 1 Brick (total value: 24) results in a net gain of 1 value for me, aligning with my goal of increasing total value. This is a low-risk move since I'm using abundant resources.\n- Given the history of rejections, this adjusted offer maintains my advantage while potentially enticing Player 0 by keeping it straightforward.\n\nBased on this, I will make the following offer to Player 0.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nBefore making a trading decision, I'll generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation based on my current situation. Here are the key principles, strategies, and insights that apply:\n\n1. **Assess Net Value Gain**: The primary goal is to ensure that any trade increases the total value of my resources. I should calculate the value of resources I'm offering versus those I'm receiving, using my assigned values (e.g., Wheat: 5, Wood: 8, etc.). Only proceed if the incoming value exceeds the outgoing value to maximize my overall portfolio. For instance, if I offer a high-value resource like Brick (24 value each), I need to demand resources that collectively exceed that value.\n\n2. **Understand Opponent's Preferences and History**: From the game history, Player 0 has repeatedly requested Brick in their offers (e.g., offering Wheat and Wood for Brick), indicating they value Brick highly and may be short on it. Conversely, they've rejected my offers involving Brick for Wheat and Wood, suggesting they perceive those trades as unfavorable. I should leverage this by offering Brick but demand a better deal than before, while starting with offers that might align more closely with their valuation to avoid further rejections.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics and Incremental Adjustments**: In negotiations, persistence is key, but repeating rejected offers leads to stalemates. Since Player 0 has rejected multiple offers (e.g., my 1 Brick for 10 Wheat or 5 Wood + 2 Wheat), I need to make incremental improvements\u2014such as offering the same high-value item (Brick) but asking for less in return to make it more appealing. This builds rapport and increases the chances of acceptance. Additionally, with only 10 turns total and several already passed, I must act proactively to avoid wasting turns.\n\n4. **Resource Scarcity and Abundance**: I have abundant Wheat (24 qty) and Ore (13 qty), which are less critical for me, so I can use them as bargaining chips if needed. However, Brick (5 qty, high value) and Sheep (5 qty) are more valuable, so I should avoid over-trading them. Player 0 seems to have excess Wheat and Wood (based on their offers), so targeting those in exchange for my Brick could be strategic, but I must ensure the trade is value-positive for me.\n\n5. **Risk Management and Time Pressure**: The game is finite, so I should prioritize trades that minimize risk of rejection while maximizing value. If an offer is rejected again, I risk ending the game without progress. Therefore, aim for a balanced offer that provides Player 0 with clear value (e.g., giving them what they want) while ensuring I gain more than I lose. Avoid desperation trades that deplete my high-value resources unnecessarily.\n\nThese principles highlight the need for calculated, adaptive offers based on historical data and value assessments.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\n\nApplying the generated knowledge to my situation:\n\n- My current resources and total value: Wheat (24 qty, value 120), Wood (9 qty, value 72), Sheep (5 qty, value 70), Brick (5 qty, value 120), Ore (13 qty, value 442), for a total of 824 value.\n- Player 0's history shows they want Brick, so I'll continue offering it but adjust based on past rejections. My previous offer of 1 Brick for 5 Wood and 2 Wheat (outgoing value: 24; incoming value: 40 + 10 = 50; net gain: 26) was rejected, so I'll make it more attractive by reducing my demands slightly.\n- New offer: I'll propose 1 Brick (value 24) in exchange for 5 Wood (value 40). This gives me a net gain of 16 value, while providing Player 0 with a high-value resource they seem to need. It's an incremental adjustment from my last offer, making it easier for them to accept.\n- This aligns with assessing net value, understanding their preferences, and managing time pressure, as I'm being proactive without overcommitting.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 5 Wood]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: My current resources have the following values: Ore (35) > Brick (25) > Sheep (14) > Wood (12) > Wheat (6). I should prioritize acquiring higher-value resources (Ore, Brick) and be cautious about giving them away unless receiving fair or surplus value in return.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost & Trade Efficiency**: Trading low-value resources (e.g., Wheat, Wood) for high-value ones (e.g., Brick, Ore) increases total value efficiently. However, offers requesting large amounts of low-value goods for a small high-value return are exploitative (e.g., 10 Wheat for 1 Brick is poor value \u2014 60 vs. 25).\n\n3. **Trade Imbalance Recognition**: Opponent repeatedly offers 1 Brick for combinations including 5 Wood + 2 Wheat (value 72 offered for 25 received) \u2014 this is highly favorable to me, but I must assess whether *accepting* such offers aligns with my strategy. However, in this case, I am the *receiver* of the offer: they offer 1 Brick, want 5 Wood + 2 Wheat \u2014 so *I would give more value* (64) for less (25). So it's a bad deal. Thus, denial is correct.\n\n4. **Strategic Offer Design**: Since I have surplus Brick (21), which is high value but not the highest, and I have very high Ore (25), I may use Brick as a trading chip to obtain even more valuable resources (if Ore prices rise) or to balance inventory toward higher-average-value holdings.\n\n5. **Counter-Offer Strategy**: Instead of accepting exploitative offers, I should make targeted counter-offers using lower-value surplus goods (e.g., Wheat, Wood) to acquire high-value goods (Sheep, Ore, Brick). For example: offer excess Wheat and Wood in bulk for Ore or extra Brick.\n\n6. **Player Behavior Analysis**: Player 1 appears eager to acquire Brick, possibly lacking it or valuing it highly. They are offering Wheat (low value) for Brick (high value), often at unfavorable ratios. This suggests I can leverage their demand by creating a selective offer that extracts maximum surplus.\n\n7. **Optimal Trade Ratios (Estimation)**:\n   - Brick value: 25 \u2192 equivalent to ~4 Wheat (4\u00d76=24), ~2 Wood (2\u00d712=24), or ~1.7 Sheep.\n   - Therefore, trading 4\u20135 Wheat for 1 Brick is fair; below is good for me. Trading 1 Brick for more than 25 units of low-value resources is acceptable.\n\n8. **Inventory Leverage**: I have 18 Wheat (low value) and 23 Wood \u2014 both relatively plentiful. I can use these to trade up. However, giving away too much Wood (value 12) should require good returns, as it's not the lowest value.\n\nStrategic Insight:  \nSince Player 1 wants Brick and is offering low-value Wheat, I should make an offer that gives a small amount of Brick in exchange for a bundle of Wheat and possibly other goods\u2014only if the total value in exceeds value out.\n\nHowever, since I have 21 Brick, which is high quantity and high value, slightly reducing Brick to gain large amounts of low-value but tradable goods could be useful if I can then trade those onward.\n\nBut better: wait for or create an offer where I trade low-value goods for high-value ones.\n\nWait \u2014 I have high Ore and Brick. Others may want these. I should *not* trade Brick for Wheat unless I get *excess* (e.g., 6+ Wheat per Brick).\n\nPlayer 1 has shown willingness to offer 5 Wheat for 1 Brick. Value: 30 in, 25 out \u2014 slight gain, but acceptable? 30 > 25 \u2192 +5 value.\n\nBut previously I rejected \u2014 probably because I can do better.\n\nAlternative: I could *offer* 1 Brick for 6 or more Wheat \u2192 net gain.\n\nBut I should prefer to acquire Ore or Sheep, the higher-value items.\n\nBut right now, no one is offering those.\n\nSince I\u2019m not receiving any favorable offers, I should make an initiative.\n\nBest plan: Offer something that uses my surplus low/mid-value resources to get a high-value one.\n\nI have 18 Wheat and 23 Wood \u2014 both lower value. I could bundle them to get Sheep or Ore.\n\nSheep value 14. So 1 Sheep ~ 2.3 Wheat or ~1.17 Wood.\n\nSo offering, e.g., 2 Wheat + 1 Wood (value: 12 + 6 = 18) for 1 Sheep (14) \u2014 acceptable to me only if I offload low-value.\n\nBut I value total value increase \u2014 so only if incoming value > outgoing.\n\nWait: Total portfolio value increases only if:\nValue(Received) > Value(Given)\n\nSo for trade to be beneficial: sum(value \u00d7 qty) received > sum(value \u00d7 qty) given.\n\nTherefore, I must ensure positive net value.\n\nAlso, I have high Brick \u2014 21. Possibly too much? But value 25 is high. Better to keep unless trade-up.\n\nPlayer 1 really wants Brick. I can exploit this.\n\nDesign an offer: give 1 Brick (25) \u2192 get multiple Wheat.\n\nBut 5 Wheat = 30 \u2192 good.\n\nBut Player 1 previously offered 5 Wheat for 1 Brick \u2014 I rejected. That would have given me +5 value.\n\nI should have accepted or now make a similar offer.\n\nBut now I will make an efficient offer.\n\nBut I want *net increase*.\n\nSo let\u2019s try: offer 1 Brick \u2192 request 6 Wheat (36). Net +11.\n\nOr request 1 Sheep (14) + 3 Wheat (18) = 32 \u2192 net +7.\n\nBut I already have 14 Sheep, so maybe not priority.\n\nBetter to get Ore.\n\nOre is 35. So to get 1 Ore, I\u2019d need to give ~1.4 Brick \u2014 but I don't want to lose Ore-equivalent value.\n\nUnless I get 1 Ore for less than 35 in value.\n\nBut hard.\n\nAlternatively: can I trade my abundant low-value for someone\u2019s excess Ore?\n\nBut no info on their inventory.\n\nBack to known: Player 1 wants Brick and offers Wheat.\n\nSo best move: make an offer that trades 1 Brick for 6 or more Wheat.\n\nEven 5 Wheat is acceptable (30 > 25), net +5.\n\nI\u2019ll make an offer: 1 Brick \u2192 6 Wheat.\n\nNet gain: 36 - 25 = +11.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait \u2014 do I want more Wheat? It\u2019s low value, but I can use it in future trades.\n\nSince the goal is *total value*, acquiring 6 Wheat (value 36) for 1 Brick (25) increases my total value by 11.\n\nYes \u2014 even though Wheat is low value per unit, the *total value transferred* is what matters.\n\nSo this is smart.\n\nAlternatively, if I can get higher-value resources, better.\n\nBut no opportunity now.\n\nSo initiate: Offer 1 Brick for 6 Wheat.\n\nBut previous offers from Player 1 were 5 Wheat for 1 Brick \u2014 close.\n\nMaybe they\u2019d accept 6 Wheat for 1 Brick.\n\nBut I want *positive* for me.\n\n6 Wheat value = 36, Brick = 25 \u2192 very good for me.\n\nSo make this offer.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 6 Wheat]",
