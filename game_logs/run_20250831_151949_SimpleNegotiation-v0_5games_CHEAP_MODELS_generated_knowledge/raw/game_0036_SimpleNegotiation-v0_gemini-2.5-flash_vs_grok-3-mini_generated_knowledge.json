      "response": "**Generate Knowledge:**\n\n1.  **Value-based Trading:** The primary goal is to increase the *total value* of my resources, not just the quantity. I need to calculate the value of both what I offer and what I request in any trade to ensure a net gain.\n2.  **Scarcity and Demand:** Resources I have in abundance might be less valuable to me than highly sought-after resources I lack or have in smaller quantities. Conversely, deeply needed resources could command a higher \"price\" in negotiations. Right now, Sheep (7) and Brick (14) are my lower quantity items.\n3.  **Marginal Utility:** The value of an additional unit of a resource changes based on how much of that resource I already possess. For example, getting more Wood when I already have 20 might be less valuable than getting more Sheep when I only have 7, even if Wood has a lower per-unit value.\n4.  **Targeting Needs:** Understanding what Player 1 might need (even if unknown at this stage) can help craft appealing offers. Currently, I don't know Player 1's inventory, so I must focus on my own gain first.\n5.  **Opening Offers:** A good opening offer should signal willingness to trade while also aiming for a clear advantage. It shouldn't be so lopsided as to be immediately rejected, but also not instantly \"fair\" from Player 1's perspective, as there's room to negotiate.\n6.  **Identifying High-Value Targets:** Ore and Brick have the highest per-unit value for me (35 and 26 respectively). Acquiring more of these, or using them to trade for items that give me a net value increase, is a priority.\n7.  **Liquidation of Low-Value Abundance:** Wheat (5) and Wood (10) are my lowest per-unit value resources and I have a large quantity (20 each). These are good candidates to offer in trades if they allow me to acquire higher-value resources.\n8.  **Strategic Small Trades vs. Large Trades:** Sometimes many small, favorable trades can accumulate value. Other times, a single large, strategic trade can provide a significant boost.\n9.  **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** My first offer shouldn't be my absolute best possible deal. I need to leave myself room to concede slightly in subsequent turns if Player 1 counter-offers, while still ensuring I profit.\n10. **Turn Limit Awareness:** With 10 turns, I need to make productive trades relatively quickly. Waiting too long for the \"perfect\" offer might mean missed opportunities.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nMy goal is to increase my total resource value. I have an abundance of Wheat (20 @ 5 value) and Wood (20 @ 10 value) and high-value Ore (20 @ 35 value) and Brick (14 @ 26 value). My Sheep quantity is relatively low (7 @ 16 value).\n\nI want to acquire more high-value resources like Ore or Brick, or bolster my lower quantity Sheep, by leveraging my abundant lower-value resources.\n\nLet's consider an offer targeting a gain in Brick or Ore value. I have plenty of Wheat and Wood to offer.\n\nOffer consideration 1: Trade Wheat/Wood for Brick/Ore.\n- Cost: 5 Wheat (25 value) + 5 Wood (50 value) = 75 value\n- Request: 2 Ore (70 value) + 1 Brick (26 value) = 96 value\n- Net gain: 21 value. This is a good starting point. It uses my low-value abundance.\n\nOffer consideration 2: Trade for Sheep, which I have less of, but combine with higher value items.\n- I have 7 Sheep. 20 Wood.\n- Offer 5 Wood (~50 value), 2 Sheep (~32 value) = Total 82 value.\n- Request: 3 Brick (~78 value), 1 Ore (~35 value) = Total 113 value. Net gain of 31. This is a bit too bold for an opener.\n\nLet's go with a balanced offer that uses my abundant lower-value resources to gain high-value resources, aiming for a clear gain for me, and hopefully attractive enough for Player 1 to consider.\n\nI will offer Wheat and Wood (my cheapest and most abundant) to gain Ore and Brick (my most valuable).\n\nMy calculation for the offer:\nOffer: 8 Wheat (8 * 5 = 40 value) + 4 Wood (4 * 10 = 40 value) = 80 total value offered.\nRequest: 2 Ore (2 * 35 = 70 value) + 1 Brick (1 * 26 = 26 value) = 96 total value requested.\nNet gain for me: 96 - 80 = 16 value.\n\nThis offers a significant chunk of my lowest value resources for a smaller quantity of high-value resources, resulting in a good value gain for me. It's a clear profit for me and uses resources I have in excess.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are relevant to my situation as Player 1, where my goal is to maximize the total value of my resources. First, **value assessment is crucial**: I must calculate the net value of any trade by comparing the total value of resources I'm receiving against those I'm giving up, based on my personal valuations. This ensures I only engage in trades that increase my overall wealth. For instance, resources like Ore (value: 39) and Brick (value: 24) are high-value for me, so I should be cautious about trading them away unless I get equivalent or greater value in return.\n\nSecond, **consider resource abundance and scarcity**: I have surpluses in Wheat, Wood, and Sheep, but Ore is relatively scarce and highly valuable. A good strategy is to trade excess low-value resources (e.g., Wheat or Wood) for high-value ones, while avoiding deals that deplete my high-value stocks without compensation. This aligns with the principle of **opportunity cost**, where I weigh if the trade advances my long-term position in a 10-turn game.\n\nThird, **negotiation leverage and fairness**: In a competitive game, I should aim for trades that favor me slightly, rejecting unbalanced offers. Strategies include denying unfavorable deals and potentially counter-offering to propose terms that better align with my interests. Additionally, with limited turns, I should prioritize immediate value gains to build momentum early.\n\nFinally, **risk management**: Always default to denying offers that result in a net loss, as per the instructions, and only accept or counter if it clearly benefits me. This promotes a defensive yet opportunistic approach.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision\nApplying these principles to Player 0's offer (Offered: 8 Wheat, 4 Wood -> Requested: 2 Ore, 1 Brick), I first assess the net value:\n\n- Value of incoming resources: 8 Wheat (8 * 5 = 40) + 4 Wood (4 * 8 = 32) = 72 total value.\n- Value of outgoing resources: 2 Ore (2 * 39 = 78) + 1 Brick (1 * 24 = 24) = 102 total value.\n- Net value change: 72 (incoming) - 102 (outgoing) = -30, which is a loss.\n\nThis trade decreases my total resource value, violating my primary goal. Given my abundance in Wheat and Wood, and the high value of Ore and Brick, this offer is unbalanced and not in my favor. According to the principles of value assessment and risk management, I should deny it. While I could counter-offer, I'll hold off for now to avoid escalating negotiations prematurely in the early turns, focusing on protecting my high-value resources.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. **Understand your inventory and values:** Clearly list what you have and what each item is worth to you. This forms your baseline for evaluating any trade.\n2. **Identify high-value resources:** Ore (35) and Brick (26) are your highest value resources. Sheep (16), Wood (10), and Wheat (5) are lower. Your goal is to increase your total value, ideally acquiring more of the high-value items or trading lower-value items for them.\n3. **Analyze the previous interaction:** Player 0 offered lower-value items (Wheat, Wood) for higher-value items (Ore, Brick). Player 1 rejected this, suggesting either the offer wasn't compelling enough, or Player 1 values those resources more than what was offered. The previous offer was 8 Wheat (40) + 4 Wood (40) = 80 value for 2 Ore (70) + 1 Brick (26) = 96 value. While it seems close in value, Player 1 may have valued the Ore/Brick higher or needed them more. The rejected offer also indicates Player 1 is not desperate to get rid of Ore and Brick.\n4. **Consider Player 1's possible needs/strategy:** Since Player 1 rejected the previous offer, they might be holding onto their high-value resources. They might be looking for a better deal or have a strategic need for those resources. You don't have information on their inventory, so you have to make an educated guess.\n5. **Formulate a new offer:**\n    * **Be flexible:** Don't just try the same type of offer again.\n    * **Increase the perceived value of your offer:** Offer items that are more valuable or in higher quantity for what you want.\n    * **Target specific resources:** Think about what Player 1 might need. Since they rejected Wheat/Wood for Ore/Brick, perhaps they need Sheep or have an abundance of Ore/Brick but not enough of something else.\n    * **Incremental adjustments:** Don't make a drastically worse offer for yourself. Make small adjustments based on the last rejection.\n    * **Trial and error:** Negotiation often involves several back-and-forth offers.\n\nTrade Decision:\nThe previous offer was (8 Wheat, 4 Wood) valued at 80 for (2 Ore, 1 Brick) valued at 96. Player 1 rejected this, suggesting they don't value Wheat and Wood enough in that quantity, or they value Ore and Brick too highly to let them go for those resources.\n\nTo make the offer more attractive, I need to either:\n1. Offer higher value resources.\n2. Offer a larger quantity of lower value resources.\n3. Request less valuable resources from Player 1.\n\nGiven that my primary goal is to increase total value, I still want to acquire high-value resources like Ore or Brick. Since Player 1 rejected my previous offer for Ore/Brick, I will try to entice them with something that might be more useful to them, and offer a better value proposition for them. I have a good amount of Wood and Wheat, but offering more of them might not work if Player 1 doesn't need them.\n\nI have 7 Sheep (value 16). Sheep is a mid-value resource. Maybe Player 1 needs Sheep, or Brick. I still want Ore.\nLet's try to offer a higher perceived value for Player 1, possibly targeting a single high-value resource from them, and using a mix of values I possess.\n\nCurrent Inventory:\nWheat: 20 (Value: 5)\nWood: 20 (Value: 10)\nSheep: 7 (Value: 16)\nBrick: 14 (Value: 26)\nOre: 20 (Value: 35)\n\nI will try to trade for Ore, as it's my highest value resource.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (48), 2 Wood (20) for 1 Ore (35), this is a loss for me (68 value offered for 35 value received). This is not optimal.\n\nLet's try to get more Brick, as it's the second highest.\nIf I offer Sheep and Wood for Brick.\nMaybe I can offer 4 Sheep (64) + 5 Wood (50) for 3 Brick (78). This is more balanced.\n\nLet me rethink. Player 1 didn't give me any counter-offer. They just rejected.\nThe previous offer was 8 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick. My value: 80, Their value: 96. My gain: -16. This was a bad proposal for me anyway, but I guess it was a probing attempt.\n\nI need to make an offer where *my* value increases.\nTo make a profit, the value I receive must be greater than the value I offer.\nSo (Requested Value > Offered Value).\n\nExample: Offer 1 Ore (35) for 5 Wood (50). My trade profit: +15. This is good for me, but Player 1 would never take it.\n\nLet's try to trade my lower value items (Wheat, Wood, Sheep) for higher value items (Brick, Ore).\nMy large quantity of Wheat and Wood can be used to purchase higher quality.\nI have 20 Wheat and 20 Wood.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of low-value resources for a single higher-value resource?\nOffer: 10 Wheat (50) + 5 Wood (50) = 100 value\nRequest: 3 Brick (78)\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nWhat if I try to get something cheaper from Player 1, that might be useful? Or give them an offer that is very good for them.\nI still want to get Ore or Brick.\nLet's try a modest offer with some Sheep.\nOffer 3 Sheep (48) + 6 Wood (60) = 108 value\nRequest 3 Brick (78) + 1 Sheep (16) = 94 value (this is bad, I lose 14 value)\n\nI need to focus on identifying how to get more value into my inventory.\nI want to increase my high-value resource quantities (Ore, Brick), or trade a large number of low-value resources for a smaller number of high-value resources where the value proposition is in my favor.\n\nLet me propose something where Player 1 gets solid value, and I try to get an edge.\nI will offer some of my cheaper resources for their Brick. Player 1 might need more Sheep, or Wood.\nSince my previous offer giving them Wood and Wheat failed, let's include Sheep.\n\nPlayer 1 has not made any offers, so I have to keep proposing.\nI'll try:\nOffer: 5 Sheep, 5 Wood -> Request: 3 Brick\nMy given value: 5*16 + 5*10 = 80 + 50 = 130\nMy requested value: 3*26 = 78\nThis is a bad offer for me, I lose 52 value.\n\nI must remember the principle of increasing my total value. `Requested Value > Offered Value`.\n\nHow about I offer something where I only exchange a small amount of value difference, or even slightly negative, to see if I can get some movement, then adjust? But my goal is profit.\n\nWhat if I offer a *slight* loss for them, but a gain for me?\nLet's try to get 1 Ore (35).\nOffer: 2 Sheep (32), 10 Wheat (50) = 82 value.\nRequest: 1 Ore (35), 1 Brick (26) = 61 value.\nThis is a gain for me (61-82 = -21), but a big loss for me.\n\nI need to reverse my thinking on some of these examples. I need to be receiving *more* value than I am giving.\n\nOffer: 20 Wheat (100) -> Request: 3 Ore (105)\nThis is a profit of +5 for me. Still a lot of Wheat. Player 1 might value Ore highly. But it's a very good value proposition for me. I'm trading my lowest value resource for my highest value.\n20 Wheat is a lot of wheat. I have 20 of them. This would free up space and give me high value items.\n\nHow about a more balanced offer, which is still good for me.\nMy previous offer of (8W, 4W) for (2O, 1B) was actually a net loss for me (-16). I should have gone for positive.\n\nLet's retry attempting to get High Value for Low Value.\nI want to gain high value items (Ore, Brick) by giving up low value items (Wheat, Wood).\nI have 20 Wheat (5 value each = 100), 20 Wood (10 value each = 200).\n\nLet's seek out Brick.\nOffer: 10 Wood (100) -> Request: 4 Brick (104)\nMy profit: +4. This is a very reasonable offer for me, and Player 1 gets a lot of Wood.\nThis is my strongest choice so far. It uses a substantial amount of Wood, but I have 20 units. I get 4 Brick, which is a good quantity of my second-highest value resource. It's a small net gain for me (+4).\n\nLet's try this.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 4 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles are crucial for maximizing value, especially in a limited-turn game like this with only 10 turns. First, always perform a net value calculation for any trade: compare the total value of resources you're offering against what you're receiving to ensure you're gaining more value overall. For instance, if the incoming offer requires you to give up high-value resources for lower-value ones, it's generally unwise to accept, as your primary goal is to increase your total resource value. Second, leverage your abundance\u2014trade excess or low-value resources (like Wheat, which has a low value of 5) for high-value ones (like Ore at 39), while being cautious not to deplete your own high-value holdings unnecessarily. Third, employ negotiation strategies such as counteroffers to test the other player's flexibility; this can build rapport and lead to better deals without immediately rejecting opportunities. Finally, consider the game's time constraint\u2014aim for efficient trades that provide immediate value gains, and be prepared to deny unfavorable offers to maintain your position for future turns. In my situation, with abundant Wood and Sheep but valuable Ore and Brick, I should prioritize trades that offload lower-value items for higher-value ones, while avoiding deals that result in a net loss.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision\n\nApplying these principles, I first evaluate Player 0's offer: They are offering 10 Wood (total value: 10 \u00d7 8 = 80) in exchange for 4 Brick (total value: 4 \u00d7 24 = 96). This would result in a net loss of 96 - 80 = 16 value points for me, which directly contradicts my goal of increasing total value. Therefore, I must deny this offer to avoid diminishing my resources.\n\nHowever, recognizing that Player 0 seems interested in Brick (based on their previous offers), I can make a counteroffer that benefits me. I'll propose trading 2 Brick (total value: 2 \u00d7 24 = 48) for 10 Wood (total value: 80), which would give me a net gain of 80 - 48 = 32 value points. This uses my Brick strategically without overcommitting, while leveraging their apparent demand. This approach aligns with negotiation tactics by turning a rejected offer into a potential opportunity.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 10 Wood]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade offer, whether outgoing or incoming, should ideally result in a net gain in value.\n2.  **Resource Utility/Scarcity:** Some resources might be more valuable to other players for specific goals (e.g., building roads, settlements, cities). Conversely, I might value certain resources more highly if I have a specific building plan in mind. Knowing the relative value to other players can help in structuring offers.\n3.  **Understanding Opponent's Needs:** While I don't know Player 1's exact needs, their previous rejections and offers (rejecting my Wood for Brick, offering Brick for Wood) suggest they might value Wood highly and are willing to part with Brick. This is a key insight.\n4.  **Counter-Offers and Negotiation Space:** Rejections are part of the negotiation. An incoming offer, even if not ideal, signifies some willingness to trade. My counter-offer should leverage the opponent's stated interest while still aiming for my value maximization.\n5.  **Per-Unit Value Calculation:** Compare the total value of resources offered versus resources requested.\n    *   My Current Values: Wheat (5), Wood (10), Sheep (16), Brick (26), Ore (35).\n\nApplying Knowledge to Decision:\n\nPlayer 1's offer: 2 Brick -> 10 Wood\n\n*   **Value of Offered Resources (Player 1):** 2 Brick * 26 = 52\n*   **Value of Requested Resources (Player 1):** 10 Wood * 10 = 100\n*   **Net Value Change for Me if Accepted:** +52 (from Brick) -100 (for Wood) = -48. This is a significant loss in value for me.\n\nThis offer is clearly unfavorable to me. I need to reject it and make a counter-offer that reflects my valuation while still acknowledging Player 1's apparent interest in Wood and willingness to offer Brick.\n\nMy previous offer of \"10 Wood -> 4 Brick\" was rejected. My 10 Wood (value 100) for Player 1's 4 Brick (value 104) was a slight gain for me, but maybe too much for Player 1.\n\nPlayer 1's current offer suggests they value 10 Wood at 2 Brick. This is a very poor rate for me. I need to push for more advantageous terms if I give up Wood, or fewer Wood if I receive Brick.\n\nPlayer 1 clearly wants Wood and is willing to give Brick. I have plenty of Wood (20) and Brick (14). My goal is value increase.\n\nGiven their offer of 2 Brick for 10 Wood, they clearly undervalue Wood or overvalue Brick relative to my exchange rate. I want more for my Wood, or less Wood for the same Brick.\n\nLet's try to find a middle ground where I gain value but it might still be acceptable to Player 1.\nIf I offered 5 Wood (50 value) for 2 Brick (52 value), that's a small gain for me, and Player 1 gets half the Wood they asked for at the same Brick cost. This might be too little Wood for them.\n\nLet's stick with the amount of Wood they asked for (10) but demand more Brick, or reduce the amount of Wood for the Brick they offered.\n\nOption 1: Offer less Wood for the 2 Brick Player 1 offered.\nIf I give 5 Wood (Value 50) for 2 Brick (Value 52), I gain 2 value. This is a small gain, but better than a loss.\n\nOption 2: Demand more Brick for 10 Wood.\nMy 10 Wood is valued at 100. If I want a small gain, I need more than 100 value in Brick.\n100 / 26 (Brick value) = ~3.8 Brick. So 4 Brick for 10 Wood would be fair (Value 104 gain). I offered this before and it was rejected.\n\nPlayer 1 offered 2 Brick for 10 Wood. Maybe they are willing to go up slightly, but not to 4. What about 3 Brick?\nMy 10 Wood (Value 100) for 3 Brick (Value 78). This is still a loss for me (-22). So, no.\n\nI need to focus on gaining value. Player 1 clearly wants Wood. I have a lot of Wood. I also have a lot of Ore and Brick.\n\nLet me consider my resources. Wheat (20), Wood (20), Sheep (7), Brick (14), Ore (20).\n\nI rejected Player 1's offer. I need to make a new offer.\nPlayer 1's interest is Wood. My goal is total value increase.\nIf I give up X Wood and get Y Brick, I need (Y * 26) > (X * 10).\n\nLet's try to offer a slightly different resource, or push for a less common trade.\nPerhaps Player 1 needs something else that I have plenty of like Wheat, or a smaller amount of Ore for Brick.\n\nLet's counter the Wood/Brick trade, but make it very slightly better for me.\nThey want 10 Wood (100 value). They offer 2 Brick (52 value).\nThe gap is 48 value.\nIf I offer 7 Wood (70 value) for 2 Brick (52 value), still a loss for me (-18).\n\nThis negotiation round for Wood/Brick is tough because Player 1 is offering disadvantageous terms for me.\nI should try to extract more value.\n\nWhat if I tried to get something completely different, like Ore, which is my highest value resource? But Player 1 hasn't shown interest in giving away Ore.\n\nI have 20 Wood, value 10. I can afford to lose some Wood to gain other resources if the trade is favorable enough.\nPlayer 1 rejected 10W->4B previously. Player 1 offered 2B->10W.\n\nThis implies Player 1 values my Wood very highly, and their Brick very lowly, or wants to get a huge advantage.\n\nI should make an offer that provides a small value gain for me, and is close to something Player 1 might accept, leveraging their revealed interest in Wood.\n\nConsider offering a smaller amount of Wood for the 2 Brick.\nIf I offer 3 Wood (value 30) for 2 Brick (value 52): Net gain +22. This is a good gain for me, but maybe too little wood for Player 1.\nIf I offer 4 Wood (value 40) for 2 Brick (value 52): Net gain +12. This is good for me.\nIf I offer 5 Wood (value 50) for 2 Brick (value 52): Net gain +2. This is a minimal gain, but it's still a gain. This might be the most \"acceptable\" to Player 1 given their extreme valuation.\n\nLet's try for a slightly better gain for me. 4 Wood for 2 Brick.\nMy valuation: 4 Wood (40) is exchanged for 2 Brick (52). Net gain of 12 value.\nThis is much better for me than accepting their offer of -48 value.\nIt still gives Player 1 the Brick they offered, and some Wood, though less than they asked for.\n\nAlternatively, should I diversify my offer? What if I try to get Ore by offering Wood?\nFor example, 10 Wood (100) for 3 Ore (105). That would be a gain of 5. But Player 1 hasn't indicated interest in offering Ore.\n\nI should focus on the revealed interest: Player 1 wants Wood, Player 1 offered Brick.\nMy best strategy is to make an offer that provides a positive value trade for me based on Wood/Brick, but is less extreme than my last offer (10W->4B) and less exploitative than Player 1's offer (2B->10W).\n\nLet's try 5 Wood for 2 Brick. It's a minimal gain for me (+2), but it acknowledges Player 1's willingness to give 2 Brick and their strong desire for Wood. It's a small step from their outrageous offer towards a neutral trade for them, while still being positive for me. It's the most likely to be accepted for a positive gain.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 5 Wood -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are crucial for maximizing the total value of my resources. Here's a summary of the most relevant ones for my current situation:\n\n1. **Value-Based Decision Making**: Always evaluate trades based on the net gain in resource value. Calculate the total value of resources you're offering versus receiving (e.g., using my assigned values: Wheat=5, Wood=8, Sheep=15, Brick=24, Ore=39). Only accept or propose trades where the incoming value exceeds the outgoing value to ensure progress toward my goal of increasing overall portfolio value. For instance, in a multi-turn game like this, even small gains per turn can compound over 10 turns.\n\n2. **Assess Opportunity and Scarcity**: Consider your resource abundance and the opponent's apparent interests. I have high quantities of Wood (23) and Sheep (20), which are less valuable per unit, so trading them for higher-value resources like Ore or Brick could be advantageous. Conversely, my Brick (value 24) and Ore (value 39) are more valuable, so I should be selective about trading them away. From the history, Player 0 has repeatedly offered Wood and seems interested in Brick, indicating their potential scarcity or demand\u2014use this to negotiate better terms.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics**: In a turn-based game, start with counter-offers that favor you slightly to test the waters, but avoid overly aggressive demands that could lead to repeated rejections. Build on past interactions: Player 0 rejected my previous offer (2 Brick for 10 Wood), suggesting they value Wood highly or Brick less, so adjust offers incrementally. Aim for win-win scenarios where you gain more value, but leave room for compromise to keep negotiations ongoing.\n\n4. **Long-Term Strategy**: With only 10 turns, prioritize trades that provide immediate value gains while maintaining flexibility. Reject unfair offers to avoid losses, and always follow up with your own proposal to advance the game. Monitor patterns\u2014Player 0's offers have escalated (e.g., from 10 Wood for 4 Brick to 5 Wood for 2 Brick), showing they might be willing to sweeten deals, so counter strategically.\n\n5. **Risk Management**: Every trade has an opportunity cost; for example, holding onto Brick could limit future options. Only propose trades where the net value gain is positive, and be prepared to deny offers that result in a net loss.\n\nApplying this to my situation: My current total resource value is 1437 (calculated as: 13 Wheat * 5 + 23 Wood * 8 + 20 Sheep * 15 + 11 Brick * 24 + 16 Ore * 39). Player 0's latest offer (5 Wood for 2 Brick) provides 5 * 8 = 40 value but requires giving 2 * 24 = 48 value, resulting in a net loss of 8 value. Thus, I should deny it and counter with an offer that flips this to my advantage, such as trading Brick for more Wood to achieve a net gain.\n\n### Trading Decision\nBased on the knowledge above, Player 0's offer of 5 Wood for 2 Brick results in a net loss (40 value received vs. 48 value given), so I will deny it to protect my total value. To advance negotiations and seek a gain, I'll make a counter-offer that leverages Player 0's interest in Brick while ensuring I receive more value. I'll propose trading 2 Brick (48 value) for 7 Wood (7 * 8 = 56 value), resulting in a net gain of 8 value for me. This adjusts slightly from their offer and my previous one, maintaining a strategic push without being too aggressive.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 7 Wood]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources.

Sheep is also a high-value resource.\n3.  **Opponent's Perspective:** I need to consider what Player 1 might value. They likely also want to increase their total resource value. If they are repeatedly rejecting offers, it means my offers are not appealing to them, either in terms of the resources offered, requested, or the ratio.\n4.  **Strategic Bidding:** My previous offers involved trading Wood for Brick, with Player 1 consistently valuing their Brick higher in exchange for Wood than I am offering.

The repeated rejection suggests deeply mismatched valuations for Wood and Brick, or Player 1 simply doesn't need Wood.\n8.  **Patience and Persistence:** The game has 10 turns.

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are relevant to my current situation as Player 1, where my goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Here's a summary of the most applicable insights:\n\n1. **Value-Based Decision Making**: Always evaluate trades based on the net gain or loss in total resource value. For example, compare the summed value of resources you're offering against what you're receiving. A trade should only be accepted if the incoming resources' value exceeds the outgoing ones, ensuring your overall portfolio improves. In my case, with resources like Ore (high value at 39 per unit) and Brick (24 per unit), I should prioritize acquiring higher-value items while offloading lower-value ones like Wheat (5 per unit).\n\n2. **Asymmetric Valuation**: Different players may value resources differently based on their needs or abundance. From the game history, Player 0 has repeatedly offered Wood (which I have in abundance) and requested Brick or Sheep (which I also have but at higher values to me). This suggests Player 0 might have excess Wood and a scarcity of Brick or Sheep. I should use this to my advantage by proposing trades where I demand more value in return for my higher-value resources, while being cautious not to overcommit if their valuation doesn't align.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics and Leverage**: In a limited-turn game (only 10 turns total), time is a constraint, so I should aim for quick, mutually beneficial deals but avoid accepting unfavorable offers. Strategies include starting with counter-offers that slightly favor me, building on rejected proposals (e.g., Player 0's repeated Wood-for-Brick offers), and using denial as a tool to signal dissatisfaction, encouraging concessions. For instance, since Player 0 has rejected my previous Brick-for-Wood offers, I can adjust by offering less of my high-value resources or demanding more of theirs.\n\n4. **Risk Management and Opportunity Cost**: Reject trades that result in a net loss, as each turn is valuable. Additionally, consider the opportunity cost of not trading\u2014hoarding resources might limit future options. In this scenario, with multiple rejections, I need to propose offers that maximize my gains while minimizing the risk of further rejections, such as targeting resources Player 0 has shown interest in exchanging.\n\n5. **Mutual Benefit Principle**: Successful negotiations often involve trades that provide value to both parties. Based on history, Player 0 seems eager for Brick or Sheep, so I can leverage this by offering them in exchange for resources like Wood, but only if the trade nets me a positive value increase.\n\nThese principles guide me to prioritize value gains, adapt to Player 0's patterns, and act decisively in a time-limited game.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\n\nApplying the above knowledge, I first evaluate Player 0's latest offer: 4 Wood (value: 4 * 8 = 32) for 3 Sheep (value: 3 * 15 = 45). This would result in a net loss of 13 value for me, violating the value-based decision making principle. Therefore, I must deny this offer to protect my total resource value.\n\nNext, I consider making a counter-offer based on negotiation tactics and asymmetric valuation. Player 0 has shown repeated interest in Brick (from prior offers like 10 Wood for 4 Brick), and I have excess Brick (11 qty) with high value (24 per unit). I can offer 1 Brick (value: 24) in exchange for 4 Wood (value: 32), which gives me a small net gain of 8 value while addressing Player 0's apparent need for Brick. This proposal builds on past interactions, minimizes my risk by offering only one unit, and aligns with the mutual benefit principle.\n\nAs a result, my trading decision is to deny the incoming offer and make this new offer.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 4 Wood]",

This means I should always aim to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or trades that result in a net gain in value.\n2.  **Scarcity and Demand:** Resources with higher values (Ore, Brick, Sheep) are likely more sought after. I have a good quantity of lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood) and a reasonable quantity of Mid-tier resources (Brick, Ore) and some Sheep.\n3.  **Understanding Opponent's Needs:** While I don't know Player 1's inventory, their rejections suggest either my offers aren't valuable enough for them, or they don't have what I'm asking for, or they value their resources higher than I do. The consistent offers from Player 1 for Wood suggest they need Wood.\n4.  **Strategic Resource Holding:** I have a good amount of Wood and Wheat, which are low-value. I should prioritize trading these away for higher-value resources like Brick, Sheep, or Ore. I also have a significant amount of Ore. While high value, diversifying or trading some for even more critical resources might be beneficial depending on future needs.\n5.  **Incremental Offers:** Continuously adjusting offers slightly based on rejections can help find a sweet spot. Player 1's last offer of \"1 Brick -> 4 Wood\" is slightly worse than my last offer of \"4 Wood -> 3 Sheep\", which was rejected. My previous offer of \"5 Wood -> 2 Brick\" was rejected. Player 1 is consistently asking for Wood and offering Brick. Their offer of 1 Brick for 4 Wood effectively values their 1 Brick at 40 (1 Brick * 26) and my 4 Wood at 40 (4 Wood * 10), making it a fair trade *if* I needed Brick. However, I have 14 Brick. I want to increase total value.\n6.  **Patience and Persistence:** Negotiation can take multiple turns. I should continue to make offers that align with my value-maximization goal.\n7.  **Identify \"Good Deals\":** A good deal involves receiving resources whose total value is significantly higher than the total value of resources given.\n8.  **Current Inventory Analysis:**\n    *   Wheat: 20 (Value 5) = 100\n    *   Wood: 20 (Value 10) = 200\n    *   Sheep: 7 (Value 16) = 112\n    *   Brick: 14 (Value 26) = 364\n    *   Ore: 20 (Value 35) = 700\n    *   Total Value: 1476\n\nPlayer 1's last offer was 1 Brick -> 4 Wood.\nValue offered by P1: 1 * 26 = 26\nValue requested by P1: 4 * 10 = 40\nThis is a negative value trade for me (I give up 40 value to gain 26 value). I should deny this.\n\nI have a lot of Wood and Ore. I want to acquire Sheep and perhaps more Brick or even more Ore if the deal is good. Player 1 seems to need Wood. I should capitalize on their need for Wood to get higher-value resources.\n\nLet's re-evaluate previous offers. My offer of \"4 Wood -> 3 Sheep\" was a good attempt (40 value for 48 value). My offer of \"5 Wood -> 2 Brick\" (50 value for 52 value) was also good. Player 1 seems to be valuing their items much higher or they're trying to gain a significant advantage.\n\nSince Player 1 is consistently offering Wood for Brick, they most likely have a surplus of Brick, or they value it lower than I do relative to their need for wood. I also have 14 Brick, so acquiring more Brick should only happen if it's an extremely good deal in my favor. My goal is *not* to acquire more Brick unless the value proposition is extremely strong.\n\nI have a large quantity of a high-value resource (Ore). Perhaps I can use that to gain even more value or diversify. However, my most plentiful low-value resource is Wood. I should focus on leveraging that.\n\nGiven Player 1's repeated interest in Wood, I should make another offer centered around trading Wood for higher-value resources, specifically Sheep or Ore. I need to tempt them with a larger quantity of Wood since they appear to have a consistent demand for it.\n\nPrevious offer: 4 Wood -> 3 Sheep (Rejected). This was 40 value for 48 value.\nPerhaps I offered too little Wood for 3 Sheep.\nWhat about offering more Wood for 2 Sheep? 5 Wood (50 value) for 2 Sheep (32 value)? No, this is bad for me.\nWhat about offering 6 Wood for 2 Sheep? (60 value for 32 value). Still bad for me.\n\nThe offer of 1 Brick for 4 Wood from P1 means they value their Brick at 40 (if they were trading fairly). If I can get 3 Sheep (48 value) for 4 Wood (40 value), that's a good trade. They rejected it. Do they not have Sheep?\n\nI will continue to try and trade my plentiful Wood for higher-value resources. Given Player 1's consistent offers for Wood, they are clearly short on it. I need to make an offer that feels beneficial to them while giving me a value gain. My previous offers of 4 Wood for 3 Sheep and 5 Wood for 2 Brick were good for me.\n\nLet's try to get Ore. Ore is my highest value resource, but I have a lot of it (20). It might be good to consolidate or exchange for other high-value resources if the deal is good.\n\nLet's try to get Sheep. I have fewer Sheep than other resources.\n\nWhat if I offer a larger quantity of Wood for a single higher-value item?\nFor 1 Ore (35 value): I'd need to give less than 35 value in Wood. Say 3 Wood (30 value)?\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore] This is a strong value gain for me (30 -> 35). Player 1 might accept if they are very short on Wood.\n\nPlayer 1 has consistently tried to get Wood from me. I have 20 Wood. I can afford to give some up for high-value resources.\n\nMy last offer was 4 Wood for 3 Sheep. This was +8 value.\n\nPlayer 1's offer: 1 Brick -> 4 Wood. I should deny this, as it's negative value for me.\n\nMy next step is to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me in terms of value, leveraging the Wood that Player 1 seems to want.\n\nI'll try 3 Wood for 1 Ore. It's a clear value increase for me and offers a high-value resource Player 1 might possess.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nIn resource trading and negotiation, especially in a competitive game with limited turns (like this one with only 10 total turns), several key principles and strategies are crucial for maximizing my total resource value. Here's a summary of the most relevant ones based on my current situation:\n\n1. **Value-Based Decision Making**: Always evaluate trades based on the net value gained or lost. For each resource, I have specific values (e.g., Wheat at 5, Wood at 8, Sheep at 15, Brick at 24, Ore at 39), so I should only accept or propose trades where the total incoming value exceeds the outgoing value. This ensures I'm building toward my goal of increasing overall portfolio value. For instance, trading low-value resources (like Wood at 8) for high-value ones (like Ore at 39) is ideal, but I must avoid overpaying.\n\n2. **Resource Abundance and Scarcity**: Trade resources I have in surplus for those that are scarcer or more valuable to me. I have abundant Wood (23 qty) and Sheep (20 qty), which are relatively low-value, so I should leverage these to acquire higher-value resources like Brick (24) or Ore (39). Conversely, I should protect my Ore (16 qty), as it's my most valuable resource. From the history, Player 0 seems interested in Brick and Ore, often offering Wood, which indicates their scarcity\u2014use this to negotiate favorable terms.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics and Opponent Analysis**: In a turn-based game, start with balanced offers to build rapport, but incrementally adjust based on rejections. Player 0 has repeatedly offered Wood (low value to me) for my Brick or Ore (high value), suggesting they value these more than I do. My previous offers (e.g., 1 Brick for 4 Wood) were rejected, indicating Player 0 won't accept deals where they lose value. Strategies include: making counteroffers that are fair but slightly in my favor, avoiding desperation (since we have limited turns), and using rejections as signals to refine offers. For example, if they've rejected 1 Brick for 4 Wood (where I'd gain value), I should try a more conservative ratio like 1 Brick for 3 Wood to test their limits.\n\n4. **Game Dynamics and Risk Management**: With only 10 turns, prioritize efficiency and avoid prolonged stalemates. Reject unfavorable offers quickly and follow up with counteroffers to keep momentum. Always calculate the opportunity cost\u2014if I don't trade, I retain my resources, so only propose deals with a positive net gain. Insights from history show Player 0 is persistent but unwilling to overpay, so I need to find a \"win-win\" zone, like equal-value trades, to encourage acceptance.\n\n5. **Psychological and Strategic Insights**: Building trust through fair offers can lead to better future trades. Since I've rejected several of their offers, they might be frustrated, so starting with an equitable proposal could reset the dynamic. However, aim to gain a slight edge to align with my competitive goal.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Make Trading Decision\n\nApplying these principles to the current situation: Player 0 has offered 3 Wood (total value: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24) for 1 Ore (value: 39). This results in a net loss for me (39 outgoing value vs. 24 incoming value, a loss of 15), so I must deny it, as it violates the value-based decision making principle.\n\nFor my next move, I need to propose a counteroffer that leverages my abundance (e.g., Brick or Wood) while addressing Player 0's apparent interest in Brick. My previous offer of 1 Brick for 4 Wood (24 vs. 32 value, a gain for me) was rejected, so I'll adjust downward for fairness while still aiming for a slight gain. Offering 1 Brick (value: 24) for 3 Wood (value: 24) creates an equal-value exchange, which aligns with negotiation tactics to build rapport and could be more acceptable. This also manages risk in a limited-turn game, as it keeps the door open for future trades without me losing value.\n\nThus, my decision: Deny the incoming offer and make a new offer of 1 Brick for 3 Wood.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wood]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade should ideally involve giving up lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or giving up a small quantity of high-value resources for a larger quantity of even higher-value resources.\n2.  **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:** I have abundant Wheat (20), Wood (20), and Ore (20). Sheep (7) and Brick (14) are moderately abundant. This gives me flexibility in offering Wheat, Wood, and Ore for trades.\n3.  **Individual Resource Values:**\n    *   Wheat: 5 (Low)\n    *   Wood: 10 (Medium-Low)\n    *   Sheep: 16 (Medium)\n    *   Brick: 26 (Medium-High)\n    *   Ore: 35 (High)\n4.  **Prioritize High-Value Acquisition:** I should aim to acquire more Brick (26) or Ore (35), especially if I can offer lower-value resources in return.\n5.  **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** For each potential trade, calculate the total value of what I'm offering versus what I'm requesting. The requested value must be greater than the offered value for the trade to be beneficial.\n6.  **Negotiation & Persistence:** Previous offers have been rejected. This indicates Player 1's valuation of resources might differ significantly from mine, or they are also trying to maximize their value. I need to adjust my offers based on their rejections and their counter-offers to find common ground.\n7.  **Identify Player 1's Needs (Inferred):** Player 1 has consistently offered Brick, often requesting Wood. This suggests they might value Wood more than I do, or they have an abundance of Brick they are willing to trade. Their valuation of Brick seems lower than mine if they're willing to trade it for Wood at a seemingly unfavorable ratio for them (e.g., 2 Brick for 10 Wood).\n8.  **Adaptation:** My previous offers have been too expensive from Player 1's perspective, or not valuable enough. The last offer from Player 1 was \"1 Brick -> 3 Wood\". This values 1 Brick at 30, which is higher than my 26 for Brick and means they offered 1 Brick (value 26) for 3 Wood (value 30). This is a bad trade for me. However, it indicates they are willing to trade Brick for Wood, and their valuation of Brick is around the 30-mark.\n\nCurrent Resources:\n*   [Wheat] Qty: 20 Value: 5 -> Total Value: 100\n*   [Wood] Qty: 20 Value: 10 -> Total Value: 200\n*   [Sheep] Qty: 7 Value: 16 -> Total Value: 112\n*   [Brick] Qty: 14 Value: 26 -> Total Value: 364\n*   [Ore] Qty: 20 Value: 35 -> Total Value: 700\nTotal Current Value: 1476\n\nThe previous offer from Player 1 was \"1 Brick -> 3 Wood\".\nMy calculation: Offer Value (1 Brick) = 26. Request Value (3 Wood) = 3 * 10 = 30.\nThis is a negative value trade for me (-4). I correctly rejected it. Player 1 seems to value Wood highly.\n\nLet's re-evaluate current strategy:\nPlayer 1 consistently wants Wood, and has offered Brick for it. I have plenty of Wood.\nI want to gain high-value resources. Brick (26) is good, Ore (35) is better.\n\nI should try to offer something Player 1 wants (Wood) for something I want (Ore or Brick).\nIf Player 1 offers 1 Brick for 3 Wood (Value 26 for 30), they're trying to gain value.\nI should aim for a trade where I offer less value than I receive.\n\nLet's try to get Ore. Ore is my highest value resource to acquire.\nI have plenty of Wood.\n1 Ore = 35.\nIf I offer Wood for Ore:\n4 Wood = 40. This is too much for 1 Ore.\n3 Wood = 30. Not quite enough for 1 Ore (35).\nIf I offer 3 Wood, I'd lose 5 value.\n\nWhat if Player 1 truly values Wood highly? They offered 3 Wood for 1 Brick.\nValue of Brick (mine) = 26.\nValue of 3 Wood (mine) = 30. Player 1 is offering 26 for 30, they're losing value based on *my* sheet.\nIf I offer wood, I need to make sure I gain.\n\nConsider the last Player 1 offer: 1 Brick (value 26) for 3 Wood (value 30). I rejected.\nLet's try to turn this around. Player 1 wants Wood.\nI will offer Wood + something else for Ore, or Wood for more Brick.\n\nWhat if I offer a balanced trade for them, but beneficial for me?\nPlayer 1 rejected \"3 Wood -> 1 Ore\". My calculation: 3 Wood = 30. 1 Ore = 35. This is +5 for me. They rejected, so 3 Wood isn't enough for 1 Ore for them.\n\nLet's try Brick. I have 14 Brick, but 20 Ore. Brick is good.\nIf Player 1 offered 1 Brick for 3 Wood. This means they are willing to part with Brick for Wood.\nWhat if I offer 5 Wood (50 value) for 2 Brick (52 value)? This is a small gain. Rejected.\nWhat if I offer 7 Wood (70 value) for 2 Brick (52 value)? This is a loss.Rejected.\nWhat if I offer 4 Wood (40 value) for 3 Sheep (48 value)? Rejected.\n\nPlayer 1 is consistently rejecting my offers if they value the requested items significantly higher, or if my offered items are not what they want in that quantity.\nPlayer 1's preferred trade seems to involve Wood for Brick based on their offers.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 values Wood highly, maybe more than my 10.\nIf they value 3 Wood at > 26 (value of 1 Brick), say 3 Wood at 27 (9 per Wood).\nThis means my 10 Wood is worth 90 if I trade with them. But I still need to gain.\n\nLet's propose a trade that gives Player 1 Wood, but in exchange for something high value to me.\nPlayer 1 repeatedly offered 1 Brick for 3 Wood. I rejected it because I lose 4 value.\nPlayer 1 offered 2 Brick for 7 Wood. My value: 2 Brick (52) for 7 Wood (70). I rejected (-18).\nPlayer 1 offered 2 Brick for 10 Wood. My value: 2 Brick (52) for 10 Wood (100). I rejected (-48).\n\nThis suggests Player 1 sees Brick as less valuable than I do (or values Wood much higher than I do).\nI have 14 Brick at value 26. They are willing to part with it.\nI have 20 Ore at value 35. I should aim for more Ore.\n\nLast offer was \"1 Brick -> 3 Wood\" from Player 1.\nI will try to make an offer where I acquire Ore, using resources I have in abundance and are of lower value.\n\nAttempt to get 1 Ore (value 35).\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (value 26) + 1 Wood (value 10)? Total: 36. This is a very small gain of 1, but I effectively trade a medium-high resource for a high resource. It's tough when Player 1 is offering Brick for Wood.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of low-value resources for a high-value one?\nI have 20 Wheat (value 5).\nIf I offer Wheat for Ore:\n7 Wheat = 35. This is an even trade for me. But Player 1 probably won't take 7 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n8 Wheat = 40. This is good for me (+5).\n\nLet's try to get something back for the Ore.\nPlayer 1 seems reluctant to trade for Ore. My previous offer of \"3 Wood -> 1 Ore\" was rejected.\nWhat about Sheep? I have 7 Sheep. Value 16.\nMy Sheep are medium value. I want to trade them if I can get higher value.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (48) for 1 Brick (26) + 1 Ore (35)? Value 61. This is a big gain for me. Unlikely.\n\nLet's go back to Player 1's consistent offers: they want Wood, and offer Brick.\nIf I can trade my Wood for their Brick, but at a ratio that benefits me slightly.\nPlayer 1 offered 1 Brick for 3 Wood (value: 26 for 30).\nPlayer 1 offered 2 Brick for 7 Wood (value: 52 for 70).\n\nI need to make the offer better for me.\nI will offer a bit of Wood and something else (low value like Wheat) for Brick or Ore.\n\nThe market trend from Player 1 is: Brick for Wood, and they value Wood highly.\nI have 20 Wood. I can spare some. I have 14 Brick. I have 20 Ore.\n\nLet's try an offer that leverages their desire for Wood but slightly tilts the value in my favor.\nI know they wouldn't accept 3 Wood for 1 Ore (30 vs 35).\nI want Ore.\nWhat if I try Wood for Brick, aiming for more favorable ratio to me?\nCurrent: 2 Brick for 7 Wood (Player 1 offer). I lose 18.\nIf I offer 2 Wood (20) for 1 Brick (26)? This is positive 6 for me from their perspective. This might be accepted.\nIt's a low-volume trade, which may be more palatable.\n\nMy goal is still to increase Total Value.\nIf I can trade 2 Wood (20) for 1 Brick (26), my Total Value increases by 6. This is a good trade.\nThis offer reverses the player 1 offer, where they offered 1 Brick for 3 Wood.\nI'm offering to give less Wood for the same Brick.\nThis is likely to be rejected as it's directly unfavorable to Player 1 based on their own offers.\n\nI have 20 Wood, 14 Brick.\nI will try to get Ore again. Last time I tried \"3 Wood -> 1 Ore\", rejected.\n\nLet's make an offer where I combine lower value resource (Wheat) with a medium value resource (Wood) to get Ore, or a good amount of Brick.\n7 Wood for 2 Brick was rejected. It was too much for Player 1.\nHow about a neutral trade in my terms, but that gives me higher value resource?\nIf I offered 1 Brick (26) for 1 Ore (35)? A +9 trade for me. But I'm trading equal tier resource. Likely rejected.\n\nLet's try to offer low-value resources for a high-value one.\nI have 20 Wheat (value 5).\nI want more Ore (value 35).\nIf I offer 6 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (35)? +5 for me. It's a lot of separate items, might be hard to process.\n\nTry to acquire more Brick from Player 1, as they seem willing to part with it.\nPlayer 1 wants Wood.\nWhat if I offer 3 Wood (30) for 1 Brick (26) + 1 Sheep (16)? Total 42. I lose 12. Bad.\nWhat if I offer 1 Wood (10) for 1 Sheep (16)? +6 gain. But Player 1 doesn't seem to want Sheep necessarily.\n\nLet's try again for Ore.\nMy previous offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore (30 -> 35). Rejected.\nWhat if I add something small?\n3 Wood (30) + 1 Wheat (5) -> 1 Ore (35). Total: 35 -> 35. This is an even value trade. It might get accepted since it's \"fair\".\nIf accepted, I swap 3 Wood and 1 Wheat for 1 Ore. I reduce lower value resources and consolidate into a higher value one, which helps with future trades.\nIt's also a smaller number of different items (two types).\n\nLet's proceed with an even value trade that gives me a higher value resource.\nOffer: 3 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore.\nMy values: 3*10 + 1*5 = 35. Requested Value: 1*35 = 35.\nThis is a neutral value trade according to my valuation. However, it shifts my portfolio to higher-value items.\nPlayer 1 might accept a 'fair' trade.\n\nAlternatively, try to get Brick at a good ratio.\nPlayer 1 offered 1 Brick for 3 Wood (26 vs 30).\nWhat if I offer them 4 Wood (40) for 2 Brick (52)? +12 for me. This is similar to their offer of 2 Brick for 7 Wood (52 vs 70).\nThis is good for me. Since they offered 2 Brick for 7 Wood (a bad trade for me), maybe 2 Brick for 4 Wood looks more appealing to them.\nMy 4 Wood = 40. Their 2 Brick = 52. I gain 12.\nBut 2 Brick for 7 Wood (player 1 offer), they would be offering 52 for 70, which is -18 for *me*.\nThey are clearly trying to get as much Wood for their Brick as possible.\nSo my offer of 2 Brick for 4 Wood (value 52 for 40) is very unlikely to be accepted by Player 1, as it is a loss for them if they value Wood as highly as their offers indicate.\n\nI need to offer enough of what Player 1 wants (Wood) to make them consider giving up Ore or Brick, but still gain value.\n\nLet's try another offer to get Ore by offering resources I have a lot of.\nI have a ton of Wheat (20).\n8 Wheat (40) for 1 Ore (35)? This is a great deal for Player 1, but I lose 5 value. Not good.\n7 Wheat (35) for 1 Ore (35). Neutral. Good for consolidating.\n\nLet's analyze Player 1's rejections.\nMy previous offers:\n1. 8 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick (40+40=80 -> 70+26=96). (+16 for me). Rejected. Too expensive for them.\n2. 10 Wood -> 4 Brick (100 -> 104). (+4 for me). Rejected.\n3. 5 Wood -> 2 Brick (50 -> 52). (+2 for me). Rejected.\n4. 4 Wood -> 3 Sheep (40 -> 48). (+8 for me). Rejected.\n5. 3 Wood -> 1 Ore (30 -> 35). (+5 for me). Rejected.\n\nAll my offers aiming for value gain were rejected. This suggests Player 1 values what I want higher, or what I offer lower.\n\nPlayer 1's offers:\n1. 2 Brick -> 10 Wood (52 -> 100). (-48 for me). Rejected.\n2. 2 Brick -> 7 Wood (52 -> 70). (-18 for me). Rejected.\n3. 1 Brick -> 4 Wood (26 -> 40). (-14 for me). Rejected.\n4. 1 Brick -> 3 Wood (26 -> 30). (-4 for me). Rejected.\n\nConclusion: Player 1 consistently wants Wood, and offers Brick for it, at a rate that is unfavorable to me. They value Wood very highly. They are also consistently rejecting my offers for Ore and Brick unless I offer extremely high value for them.\n\nI have 20 Wood. I should capitalize on Player 1's high demand for Wood.\nIf Player 1 offers 1 Brick for 3 Wood, and I reject, I clearly signal I want more than 26 value for 30.\nWhat if I offer something in between my last offer (3 Wood -> 1 Ore) which was rejected, and something Player 1 might accept?\nPlayer 1 needs Wood.\nWhat if I offer 5 Wood (50) for 2 Ore (70)? This is a +20 gain for me. Probably too much.\n\nGiven Player 1's consistent desire for Wood, I can use my abundance of Wood to get something higher value.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wood for a significant amount of Ore?\nExample: 10 Wood (100) -> 3 Ore (105). (+5 for me). This is a large quantity trade, might attract Player 1.\nI still have 10 Wood left if this goes through.\nThis adheres to value maximization and resource abundance.\n\nYes, this seems like a reasonable approach. Offer a substantial amount of Wood, which Player 1 clearly values, for a good amount of my highest value resource, Ore. The value gain for me is positive.\n\n```\n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 3 Ore]\n```",
