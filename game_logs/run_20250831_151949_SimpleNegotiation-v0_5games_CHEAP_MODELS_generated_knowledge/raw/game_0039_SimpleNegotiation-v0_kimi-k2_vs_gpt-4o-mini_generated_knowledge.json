      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\nPrinciple 1 \u2013 Scarcity drives value.  \nOre is both the highest-value resource (36) and our scarcest (only 10). Keeping an Ore buffer is crucial, so any trade involving Ore should yield extremely high total value or secure an even scarcer resource.\n\nPrinciple 2 \u2013 Value-to-quantity ratio.  \nBrick (22 value) looks abundant (23 qty) but its ratio (\u2248 0.96) is much better than Wheat\u2019s (\u2248 0.32) or Wood\u2019s (\u2248 0.5). Brick is therefore the most efficient \u201clarge\u201d give-away. Sheep is next best at \u22480.87.\n\nPrinciple 3 \u2013 Marginal value vs. absolute quantities.  \nExtra units beyond what\u2019s needed for any in-game objective drop sharply in value. Counts: Wheat 19, Wood 24, Sheep 15, Brick 23 \u2013 we clearly have surplus Wheat and Wood; Brick and Sheep are \u201cmoderate\u201d; Ore is thin\u2014even 1 extra Ore is precious.\n\nPrinciple 4 \u2013 Negotiator surplus.  \nSuccessful trades should make BOTH parties feel they gain. So we should package abundant, low-marginal-value resources and request the other side\u2019s abundant, low-marginal-value ones in return.\n\nPrinciple 5 \u2013 Show flexibility but employ controllable increments.  \nInstead of big shifts, propose small bundles first so we retain bargaining power for later turns.\n\n---\n\nApplying Knowledge & Trading Decision\n\nSurplus analysis: Wheat 19 and Wood 24 are our strongest \u201cgive\u201d candidates. Brick 23 looks high-count yet we already know its value is very respectable; we should be willing to shed some but not too much. Ore is \u201cno-sell\u201d unless the return is mind-blowing.\n\nOpportunity scan: No current offer on the table yet. The logical first move is to float an exploratory offer that exchanges excess Wheat+Wood (two low-value goods for us) for Brick or Sheep (high-value per unit for the recipient) but only sparingly so we still net value.\n\nEarly balanced offer test: 3 Wheat 2 Wood (combined marginal value = 3\u00d76 + 2\u00d712 = 42) in exchange for 4 Brick (4\u00d722 = 88) looks too favourable to us and probably gets rejected. Instead we scale down.\n\nRe-scaled proposal:  \nGive away: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood (sum value 42)  \nReceive: 2 Brick (44) + 1 Sheep (13) \u2192 57 total to us.  \nRisk: still 13 point surplus for them, might be acceptable. Yet this shrinks their Brick supplies, potentially irking them.\n\nConservative, truly small test:  \nGive 2 Wheat (12) + 1 Wood (12) = 24.  \nAsk 1 Brick (22) + 1 Sheep (13) = 35. Still 11 advantage to us\u2014likely a non-starter.\n\nRealistic seed offer:\n\nGive 2 Sheep (26) + 1 Wheat (6) = 32  \nReceive 3 Brick (66) + 1 Sheep return (13) = 79.  \nNet +47 for us but only \u22121 Sheep for them apart from Brick\u2014too lopsided.\n\nResult: The safest small bundle containing only our surplus low-value resources without touching Ore is:\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]\n\nThis package:\n- We \u201csell\u201d low value assets (3W+2Wd = 3\u00d76+2\u00d712 = 42)  \n- We gain 5 Brick (5\u00d722 = 110) \u2013 2 return Sheep sunk cost (2\u00d713 = 26) \u2192 net +68 value to us, feels efficient yet leaves us ample slack in Wheat/Wood reserves for later turns if they counter-offer.\n\nIf they deny we can quickly downscale to 2 Wheat/1 Wood for 2 Brick/1 Sheep.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]",

      "response": "Generated Knowledge:\n1. Value-density focus: Brick has the highest per-unit value in my portfolio (22) but Ore is even more valuable (36). Sheep, however, is the next most-valuable per-unit after Ore. Giving away high-value items hurts more per unit than low-value ones, so I should avoid trading high-value units unless the gain is even greater in value.\n\n2. Scarcity vs. abundance: I have 19 Wheat (6 value each) and 24 Wood (12 value each) \u2013 these are my most abundant, lowest-value resources. They are my ideal trade chips if the return is good.\n\n3. Opportunity cost of Brick: Brick gives 22 value and I already have 23. Adding 5 Brick (110 total value) is not as good as gaining 2 Sheep (26 value) per unit unless I\u2019m getting a net-value improvement. My previous offer (3 wheat = 18 value + 2 wood = 24 value for 5 brick = 110 + 2 sheep = 26) actually had me giving up 42 value for 136, so I was overpaying by 94 value in total. That explains the rejection.\n\n4. Rejection feedback: The 1:1 value trade (giving 42, getting 136) was way in my favor. But I must have been asking for too much or too little value in return \u2013 perhaps the perceived value for Player 1 was worse. I need to rebalance offers so the value gain per unit makes sense to both sides.\n\n5. Marginal value: I have 23 Brick already, so the marginal value of more Brick is low \u2013 I have enough. I only have 10 Ore \u2013 the most valuable. I should prioritize gaining Ore over Brick.\n\n6. Fair exchange: A good trade should give Player 1 more value than they give me, so they accept, while still netting me a gain in total value (even if not per-unit). My prior offer was too lopsided in my favor \u2013 it seems too good for me, so Player 1 rejected it despite it being in their favor per unit. I must have overestimated the value of Brick or Sheep to Player 1.\n\n7. Revised target: Instead of asking for more Brick, I should target gaining Ore (36 value) or Sheep (13 value), as they have higher value per unit and I have fewer of them.\n\n8. Reciprocal gain: I need trades where I gain more value in the return than I give, but also where Player 1 feels they gain more or equal value than they give. This balances both incentives.\n\nApplied Decision:\nI have 19 wheat (6 each) and 24 wood (12 each) \u2013 both low value and surplus. Ore is my most scarce and highest value (36 each). I should target more Ore. A fair trade would give Player 1 value slightly higher than what I\u2019m giving, but still net me more total value due to value per unit differences.\n\nI will offer:\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 2 Sheep]\n\nValue calculation:\n- Giving 5 wood = 60 and 3 wheat = 18 (total 78)\n- Getting 1 ore = 36 and 2 sheep = 26 (total 62)\n\nValue gain for me: I\u2019m losing 78 value but gaining 62, net loss of 16 \u2013 not ideal, but this trade is likely to be rejected as I\u2019m giving too much value.\n\nAdjusting to a more balanced offer: I want to gain Ore (36) and possibly Sheep (13). I must give up more wood/wheat. Let\u2019s try:\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 3 Sheep]\n\nValue calculation:\n- Giving 5 wood = 60 and 4 wheat = 24 (total 84)\n- Getting 1 ore = 36 and 3 sheep = 39 (total 75)\n\nStill a net loss of 9 for me, but closer. I need more gain on my side \u2013 I need more Sheep (13) than Ore. Let me revise slightly:\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 2 Sheep]\n\nValue calculation:\n- Giving 3 wood = 36 and 3 wheat = 18 (total 54)\n- Getting 1 ore = 36 and 2 sheep = 26 (total 62)\n\nThis gives me a net gain of 8 value. The trade is in my favor, but not too lopsided \u2013 Player 2 might accept if they have surplus Ore and Sheep, as giving 62 value for 54 is reasonable.\n\nFinal Action:\n[Offer: 3 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 2 Sheep]",

Diversification vs Concentration  \n   Your strongest concentration is 36 days worth of value in only 10 Ore\u2014high risk; increasing Ore could pay off large, but any reduction in Wood/Wheat will improve your average value per card and protect against variability.\n\n4. Foot-in-the-door Tuning  \n   Each trade we have offered progressively sacrificed fewer high-value cards (last effective trade moved only 2 Sheep and no Ore).  \n   Next logical step is to pivot \u201cgive Wood/Wheat (low ratio) for Ore (high ratio)\u201d but push slightly bigger Wood blocks and ask for single Ore plus scraps to avoid rejection again.\n\n5. End-turn signaling  \n   Game is currently ending soon. Player 1 tends to accept if the gain for them is visibly structured as \u201cI get more items or higher-valued same-items than I give.\u201d  \n   Offer asymmetric numbers: give 5 \u201ccheap\u201d for 1 \u201cexpensive\u201d plus minor sweetener so both sides feel they win.\n\nApply Knowledge \u2013 Trade Decision:\n\nOffer Wheat and Wood (the two lowest-value / highest-quantity resources I have) for Ore (scarce, highest value).\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]",

In this case, the values assigned to the resources are essential for making informed decisions. For example, Ore (Value: 34) and Brick (Value: 24) are high-value resources compared to Wheat (Value: 5) and Wood (Value: 9).\n\n2. **Supply and Demand**: The market dynamics often dictate that the value of a resource can increase if it's in lower supply or high demand among players. Prioritizing trading for resources that you need more urgently can lead to long-term gains.\n\n3. **Negotiation Strategy**: When negotiating, it is often beneficial to offer lower-value resources in exchange for higher-value resources. Combining resources to fulfill desired trades can maximize gains.\n\n4. **Trade Ratio Analysis**: Evaluate trade offers not just in total value, but in ratios. You need to build a strategy around how many units you give compared to what you receive.\n\n5. **Long-term View**: Weigh immediate gains against potential future opportunities. Sometimes, settling for a fair trade now can lead to greater advantages later.\n\n### Applying Knowledge to Trading Decision\n\nGiven the current offer from Player 0: \n- **Offered**: 5 Wood, 4 Wheat \n- **Requested**: 1 Ore, 1 Brick\n\n1. **Resource Evaluation**:\n   - I have 25 Wood (Value: 9), and trading 5 Wood (Value: 9 * 5 = 45) and 4 Wheat (Value: 5 * 4 = 20) totals 65.\n   - In exchange, Player 0 asks for 1 Ore (Value: 34) and 1 Brick (Value: 24), which totals 58.\n\n2. **Value Comparison**:\n   - The trade would yield a positive net gain since the resources I am acquiring (58) have a lower total value compared to what I\u2019m giving up (65). Therefore, the immediate aftermath indicates a slight loss in absolute values. \n\n3. **Future Considerations**:\n   - I currently possess 25 Ore, which is a significant amount. If the negotiation leads to acquiring Brick, it can benefit long-term development, especially since it can be more useful down the line compared to Wood and Wheat.\n\nHowever, accepting trades that slightly reduce my resource value doesn\u2019t help in maximizing my resource potential for future turns. \n\nConsidering the importance of resource management along with immediate needs and potential for future trades, I will decline this offer.\n\n### Decision\n'[Deny]'",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge\n\n1.

Marginal value & diminishing returns  \n   \u2022 I have only 10 Ore but 24 Wood and 19 Wheat.  \n   \u2022 Giving up 3-5 Wood/Wheat barely moves my side of the value ledger but can be very attractive to an opponent who may be short on those basics.\n\n3. Creating \u201cwin-win\u201d packages  \n   \u2022 A package should leave BOTH players with a net surplus in their own valuation model.  \n   \u2022 Brick is high-value to me (22) but the opponent might value it near parity with Wood (12). Therefore 1 Brick for me feels like \u2248 22 value, 1 Wood for the opponent feels like \u2248 12.\n\n4. Anchoring & graduated concessions  \n   \u2022 If a first offer is rejected, gradually sweeten it instead of leaping from 2 Wheat to 6 Wheat (that teaches the opponent to hold out for more).  \n   \u2022 Keep the counter-offer just better than the last rejected one, but not excessively generous.\n\n5. Scarcity signals  \n   \u2022 Ore\u2019s extreme value + my low quantity means hoarding it is sentimental; any incoming offer must therefore overpay.  \n   \u2022 Wood/Wheat abundance (24/19) signals they are prime trade fodder.\n\n6. Closing the trade window  \n   \u2022 By turn 6 we have numerous \u201cstall\u201d rejections.

For example, if Brick has a high value, it may justify giving away more of a lower-value resource.\n\n4. **Win-Win Solutions**: The goal of negotiation is often to find a solution that benefits both parties.

How to sweeten a deal  \n   Player 1 has rejected most of my previous premium grabs (asking for Brick + Ore). Instead of over-paying for premium goods, re-package my lower-value surplus (large quantities of Wood/Wheat) into bigger bundles so the *perceived* improvement is large without hurting my surplus in remaining stock. The accepted offers so far show Player 1 is willing to trade 1) Brick for low-tier resources, 2) Sheep for low-tier resources, but usually balks when Ore is requested.\n\n5.

Not acceptable.\n\nIf I offer 5 Wood + 4 Wheat (value 5\u00d712 + 4\u00d76 = 60 + 24 = 84) and ask for only 2 Brick (value 44) the deal looks generous. However, Player 1 already rejected 5 Wood + 4 Wheat for 1 Ore + 1 Brick. A pattern appears that Player 1 will trade Brick but only for lower basis.\n\nAdjust for what Player 1 *will* accept  \nPast accepted ratios:  \n- 2 Sheep + 3 Wood \u2192 3 Brick + 1 Sheep  (value offered 13\u00d72+12\u00d73=62, value gained 22\u00d73+13=79, surplus 17 for me)  \n- 2 Wood + 4 Wheat \u2192 3 Brick + 1 Sheep  (value offered 12\u00d72+6\u00d74=48, value gained 79, surplus 31 for me) shows they wildly over-value brick relative to wood/wheat.\n\nHence a slightly more aggressive ask (lower return) might still be accepted.\n\nBetter offer: give 2 Sheep + 3 Wood \u2192 5 Brick + 1 Sheep.  \nValue given: 3\u00d712 + 2\u00d713 =  36 + 26 = 62.  \nValue gained: 5\u00d722 + 1\u00d713 = 110 + 13 = 123 \u2192 surplus 61. Quite generous to me. But Wood is now my truly abundant surplus (22 left), Sheep still OK (12 left). There is room.\n\nEven safer: 3 Wood + 1 Wheat -> 2 Brick (value 12\u00d73 + 6 vs 22\u00d72 = 42 vs 44). Net value gained 2. Still above zero but slim. To push it through wheat/wood heavy offers, keep the numbers low so the trade feels compartmental.\n\nHowever, I currently hold:  \nWheat 15, Wood 22, Sheep 13, Brick 21, Ore 10\n\nI want to turn excess Wood/Wheat into Brick. A moderate bundle:\n 4 Wheat + 3 Wood \u2192 5 Brick  \n Value given = 24 + 36 = 60  \n Value gained = 110  \n Net surplus = +50. It matches the pattern (low-tier resources for Brick).
