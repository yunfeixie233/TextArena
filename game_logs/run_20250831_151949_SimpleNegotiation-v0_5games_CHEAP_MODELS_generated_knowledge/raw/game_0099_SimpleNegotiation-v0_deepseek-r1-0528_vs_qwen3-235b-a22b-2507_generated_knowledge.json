      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\nAs Player 0, I analyze my position using these principles:\n1. **Value Optimization Priority**: Trade low-value-per-unit resources for high-value ones to maximize total portfolio value. Based on my valuations:\n   - **Avoid giving**: Ore (35) and Brick (28), as they are highly valued.  \n   - **Prioritize receiving**: Ore and Brick (though Brick is abundant, its high value makes gains beneficial).  \n   - **Trade away cautiously**: Sheep (18; moderate value) only for disproportionate gains.  \n   - **Aggressively offload surplus**: Wheat (6) and Wood (8) due to low value per unit.  \n2. **Trade Leverage**: I have large quantities of low-value resources (Wheat:16, Wood:22) to use as bargaining chips. Trading these minimizes loss risk while targeting scarce high-value resources.  \n3. **Scarcity Consideration**: I have limited Ore (6), so acquiring more adds significant value. Sheep (8) is moderate\u2014trading small amounts is acceptable for net gains.  \n4. **Mutual Benefit Simulation**: Propose balanced offers that *could* appeal to opponents (e.g., trading common resources like Wood/Wheat for rarer ones like Ore/Brick).  \n5. **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid offers depleting critical resources (e.g., I won\u2019t trade >2 Ore/Brick unless net gains are exceptional).  \n6. **Turn Efficiency**: In 10-turn constraints, prioritize simple, high-yield trades early.  \n\n**Key Insight**: Target 1:1 or multi-resource swaps where my \"give\" resources cost me \u226470% of the value I \"get\" to ensure profit and opponent appeal.  \n\n### Trading Decision\n- **Goal**: Trade low/moderate-value resources for high-value Ore.  \n- **Proposed Offer**: \n  - **Give**: 1 Sheep (my value: 18) + 1 Wood (my value: 8) \u2192 **Total cost: 26**  \n  - **Request**: 1 Ore (my value: 35) \u2192 **Total gain: 35**  \n- **Net Value Impact**: +9 (35 - 26), increasing total from 1242 to 1251.  \n- **Strategic Rationale**:  \n  - Uses surplus Wood (22 available) and 1 of 8 Sheep (minimal depletion risk).  \n  - Targets scarce Ore (6 \u2192 potential 7), amplifying value gain.  \n  - Fair opponent pitch: Common resources (Sheep/Wood) may be desired by others for \"recipes\" or upgrades, while Ore might be abundant for them.  \n- **Risk Control**: Low exposure\u2014only 12.5% of Sheep and 4.5% of Wood traded. Rejects if counteroffers demand Ore or excessive Brick.  \n\n**Action**: [Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\n1. **Resource Value Prioritization**: Focus on acquiring resources with higher per-unit value (Ore: 35, Brick: 28) while trading away lower-value resources (Wheat: 6, Wood: 8).

High-quantity high-value resources (Brick: 22) can be used sparingly to access scarce high-value targets.\n3. **Incentivize the Counterparty**: After rejection, sweeten offers by increasing quantity or shifting to less valuable (to you) resources.

      "response": "### Relevant Knowledge for Resource Trading and Negotiation\n\n1. **Value-Based Trading**: Prioritize trades where the received resources' total value (based on your valuation) exceeds the given resources. This directly increases your total value.\n   \n2. **Leverage Resource Abundance**: Trade surplus low-value resources to acquire higher-value ones. You have excess Wood (22, value 8) and Wheat (16, value 6) but limited Ore (6, value 35) and moderate Sheep (8, value 18). Brick (22, value 28) is valuable but plentiful.\n\n3. **Negotiation Dynamics**: After previous rejections (e.g., 1 Brick \u2192 1 Ore and 1 Sheep + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore), Player 1 may value Ore highly or lack surplus. Shift focus to attainable gains, like trading low-value resources for Brick.\n\n4. **Risk Mitigation in Final Turn**: With the game ending after this turn, propose only upside trades\u2014offers that, if accepted, boost your value.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \nIn resource-based negotiation games, the core objective is to increase the total value of one's resources by leveraging differences in scarcity, utility, and perceived value between players. Key principles include:\n\n1. **Value Asymmetry**: Trade is beneficial when both parties value the items differently. I should assess trades based on my own valuation (given in the problem) and look for opportunities where the other player may undervalue a resource I hold in excess\u2014or overvalue one I need.\n\n2. **Resource Valuation**: My current valuations are:\n   - Wheat: 5\n   - Wood: 9\n   - Sheep: 14\n   - Brick: 24\n   - Ore: 38\n\n   Ore is my most valuable resource (38), followed by Brick (24), then Sheep (14). Wood (9) and Wheat (5) are lower value.\n\n3. **Opportunity Cost**: Giving up 1 Ore (value 38) should only be done if I receive resources in return with a combined value greater than 38 \u2014 otherwise, it\u2019s a net loss.\n\n4. **Surplus and Demand**: I have high quantities of Sheep (21) and Brick (22), and Ore (19). These could be used as trade leverage. However, Ore is high-value, so I should be cautious about giving it away unless receiving high-value compensation.\n\n5. **Trade Leverage**: The offers from Player 0 so far:\n   - 1 Sheep + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore (value: 14+9=23 for them; they want 1 Ore=38 from me) \u2192 unacceptable: I lose 15 net value.\n   - 1 Brick \u2192 1 Ore (24 for 38): again, I lose 14 value.\n   - 2 Wood \u2192 1 Brick: They offer 2\u00d79=18 value (Wood) for my 24-value Brick. I would lose 6 value.\n\n   All their offers are unfavorable\u2014they all involve me giving a higher-valued resource in exchange for lower-valued ones.\n\n6. **Strategic Initiative**: Since passive rejection leads nowhere, I must proactively make a balanced offer that:\n   - Increases my total value\n   - Is appealing enough for Player 0 to accept (perhaps they value resources differently)\n   - Focuses on converting surplus low-to-mid value items (like Sheep or Wood) into higher-value resources (preferably Ore or Brick, though I already have many Bricks)\n\n   However, since Ore has the highest value, acquiring more Ore would be optimal if possible.\n\n7. **Reverse Offers**: I should consider offering resources I have in surplus (e.g., Sheep = 21, Brick = 22) to acquire Ore, or possibly trade down on less valuable resources if it increases overall value.\n\n   Example: Could I give 2 Sheep (2\u00d714=28) and get 1 Ore (38)? That would be a net gain of 10 value. Even better: give lower-value resources (like Wood or Wheat) for Ore.\n\n   But Player 0 hasn't shown willingness to give Ore except in bad trades. So perhaps I should *offer* Ore only if I get substantial value in return.\n\n   Alternatively, I could trade excess Brick (22) for Ore. But only if I get more than 38 value in return.\n\n8. **Psychological Timing**: After several rejections, a fair offer might break the deadlock. An offer that appears balanced or slightly favorable to the opponent might be accepted.\n\nDecision:\n\nPlayer 0 just offered: 2 Wood \u2192 1 Brick (value: 18 \u2192 24). This is still bad for me (lose 6 value), so rejecting is correct.\n\nBut to move forward, I must make a proactive offer.\n\nI am rich in Sheep (21) and Brick (22). Ore is most valuable. Suppose I try to trade surplus Sheep for Ore.\n\nLet me propose: Offer 3 Sheep (3\u00d714=42) for 1 Ore (38). This is a slight loss for me, but may be acceptable if Player 0 values Sheep highly.\n\nBut why would I want to lose value?\n\nBetter: Flip it. Since I have a lot of Ore (19), maybe I can trade excess Ore for other high-value returns?\n\nWait \u2014 alternative insight: Maybe Player 0 is trying to collect Brick or Wood for a building purpose, independent of value. I could exploit this by marking up the value of Brick in my offers.\n\nBut I must not give away high-value resources for low.\n\nBest strategy: Use surplus Sheep (21 is a lot) to trade for Ore.\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep + 1 Brick \u2192 1 Ore\n\nValue: I give 2\u00d714 + 24 = 52, get 38 \u2192 too much.\n\nToo high.\n\nOffer: 1 Sheep + 1 Wood + 1 Brick \u2192 1 Ore \u2192 14+9+24=47 \u2192 too much for 38.\n\nStill bad.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps I should *accept* that I may not get Ore easily.\n\nAlternative: Maybe trade down on Brick (I have 22) for Sheep or Wood? But I already have more Sheep.\n\nNo \u2014 better to increase value.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe Player 0 values Wood highly? They keep offering it.\n\nThey offered 2 Wood for 1 Brick. So perhaps they really want Brick.\n\nSo I can leverage that.\n\nI can offer 1 Brick \u2192 2 Wood + 1 Sheep.\n\nLet\u2019s see: I give 24 value, get 2\u00d79 + 14 = 18+14=32. Net gain: +8.\n\nThat\u2019s good.\n\nBut is it attractive to Player 0? They seem to want Brick, so giving up 1 Brick for 2 Wood and 1 Sheep might be appealing if they are short on those.\n\nBut they offered 2 Wood for 1 Brick \u2014 meaning they are willing to trade 2 Wood to get 1 Brick.\n\nSo if I offer 1 Brick for 2 Wood + 1 Sheep, I'm taking more than they offered, so they might not accept.\n\nBut the trade is better than what they proposed \u2014 they previously gave 2 Wood for just 1 Brick. Now I'm offering 1 Brick for 2 Wood + 1 Sheep. So they get more.\n\nIn their offer: they give 2 Wood, get 1 Brick.\n\nIn my hypothetical: they give 2 Wood + 1 Sheep, get 1 Brick.\n\nThat\u2019s worse for them.\n\nSo they won\u2019t accept.\n\nReverse: I want to *acquire* value.\n\nBetter: I should offer low-value resources to get high-value ones.\n\nBest surplus: Sheep (21) \u2014 high quantity, mid value.\n\nWood (7) \u2014 medium.\n\nCan I offer 2 Sheep + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Brick?\n\nI give: 2\u00d714 + 9 = 37, get 24 \u2014 loss.\n\nNo.\n\nOffer 3 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick? 42 for 24 \u2014 worse.\n\nNo.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore \u2192 2 Brick?\n\nI give 38, get 48 \u2014 net gain +10.\n\nBut I have 19 Ore \u2014 can afford to trade one if I gain value.\n\nBut Player 0 would have to have Brick to give \u2014 they just asked for 1 Brick, so they may not have surplus.\n\nBut perhaps.\n\nAlternatively: Offer 1 Ore \u2192 3 Sheep + 1 Wood? 3\u00d714=42 +9=51 \u2192 gain 13? Wait, I give Ore (38), get 51 \u2014 yes.\n\nBut do I want more Sheep and Wood? I already have 21 Sheep and 7 Wood. Probably not.\n\nSo it\u2019s a net value increase, but functional oversupply.\n\nStill, objective is total value \u2014 not utility.\n\nSo value increase is good.\n\nBut I should aim for high-value, compact resources.\n\nBest: get more Ore, but I already have it.\n\nAlternatively: trade towards higher concentration.\n\nBut let\u2019s focus: I need an offer that I haven't made, that increases my total value, and is plausible.\n\nAnother idea: I have 13 Wheat \u2014 value 5, very low. Can I trade Wheat?\n\nBut no one has offered Wheat.\n\nBut I could offer Wheat + something for better resources.\n\nE.g., 2 Wheat + 1 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore? I give 10+14=24, get 38 \u2192 gain 14. Good.\n\nBut does Player 0 have Ore?\n\nThey've been requesting Ore \u2014 possibly short on it.\n\nUnlikely.\n\nBut I must try.\n\nBut they may not accept.\n\nWait \u2014 the only way to gain value is to receive high-value items.\n\nOre is the only one higher than 24.\n\nSo to increase value efficiently, I need Ore.\n\nBut giving up less than 38 to get 1 Ore is ideal.\n\nFor example: 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore: give 28, get 38 \u2192 gain 10.\n\nThat\u2019s excellent.\n\nDo I have 2 Sheep? Yes, 21.\n\nSo offer: 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore.\n\nBut would Player 0 accept? They would be giving 38 value for 28 \u2014 net loss. Unlikely.\n\nBut maybe they need Sheep for something.\n\nPreviously, they offered 1 Sheep + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore \u2014 so they are willing to give up 23 to get 38 \u2014 that\u2019s good for them.\n\nSo they are eager for Ore.\n\nSo they won\u2019t want to give Ore.\n\nThus, I must *receive* Ore, not give it.\n\nSo offering 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore is a good deal for me, but bad for them \u2014 low chance.\n\nBut maybe at some point, to break the deadlock.\n\nAlternatively, use mix.\n\nAnother idea: I have a lot of Brick (22). If I can trade 1 Brick for 2 Sheep and 1 Wood, for example?\n\nI give 24, get 14+14+9 = 37? 2 Sheep is 28 +9=37 \u2014 wait.\n\n1 Brick (24) \u2192 2 Sheep (28) + 1 Wood (9) = 37 \u2192 gain 13.\n\nGreat.\n\nAnd Player 0 might accept if they need Brick \u2014 they just asked for 1 Brick.\n\nSo I can be the supplier.\n\nSo: Offer: 1 Brick \u2192 2 Sheep, 1 Wood\n\nThat is: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wood]\n\nSlight correction: format is [Offer: Offered -> Requested]\n\nSo: [Offer: 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wood]\n\nValue to me: give 24, get 28+9=37 \u2192 net +13.\n\nGood.\n\nAnd it uses my surplus Brick.\n\nI have 22 \u2014 plenty.\n\nSheep at 21 is also high, but getting two more is not bad if value increases.\n\nEven if I have more Sheep, total value is what matters.\n\nSo this is a strong move.\n\nI could make it more balanced to increase chance of acceptance.\n\nBut the goal is not to be generous \u2014 it's to increase my value.\n\nIf they accept, I win.\n\nIf not, no loss.\n\nSo I should make this offer.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wood]",

      "response": "**Generate Knowledge: Key Principles and Strategies**  \n- **Value Maximization**: Prioritize trades that yield a net gain in total resource value. Calculate net gain/loss: (Value gained) - (Value given).  \n- **Resource Scarcity and Abundance**: Protect scarce, high-value resources (e.g., Sheep: 18 value, only 8 units). Leverage abundant, lower-value resources (e.g., Wood: 8 value, 22 units; Wheat: 6 value, 16 units) for trades.  \n- **Opponent Behavior Insight**: Player 1 consistently rejects offers that benefit Player 0 (e.g., trading low-value resources for high-value Ore/Brick) and proposes lopsided trades (favors Player 1). Researching negotiaitons shows that Players with high value resources like Ore may be value hoarders. Be cautious with trades involving Ore or Brick.  \n- **Inventory Optimization**: High-value resources (Brick, Ore) should be acquired cheaply. Avoid over-accumulating Brick (current: 22 units) unless for significant gain. Target Ore (35 value, only 6 units) to boost total value efficiently.  \n- **Negotiation Tactics**: Start with conservative offers using abundant resources. If rejected, incrementally increase generosity but avoid net losses. After a rejection, pivot to a new resource pairing to probe opponent's interests.  \n\n**Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision**  \n- **Evaluate Player 1's Offer**:  \n  - Player 1 offers: 1 Brick (Value: 28) \u2192 Requests: 2 Sheep (2\u00d718=36) + 1 Wood (8).  \n  - Net value for me: 28 (gain) - (36 + 8) = -16 (loss).  \n  - Sheep are scarce (8 units) and high-value\u2014trading them erodes long-term value.  \n  - **Decision**: Deny\u2014the trade is highly unfavorable.  \n\n- **New Offer Formulation**:  \n  - **Goal**: Use abundant Wood (22 units, low value) to target high-value resources with positive net gain. Player 1 may want Wood (based on their request).  \n  - **Proposal**: Offer 6 Wood (6\u00d78=46 value) for 2 Brick (2\u00d728=56 value).  \n    - Net gain: 56 - 48 = +8.  \n    - Why acceptable?

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Resource Valuation and Trade Efficiency**:\n   - Each resource has a fixed value: Wheat (5), Wood (9), Sheep (14), Brick (24), Ore (38).\n   - The goal is to maximize the total value of your holdings. Therefore, any trade should ideally result in a net gain in total value, or support a strategic accumulation of high-value resources.\n\n2. **Net Value Calculation**:\n   - Evaluate every trade offer by calculating the value of resources given versus received.\n   - Accept only offers where the value received > value given, unless strategic positioning justifies a neutral or slightly negative trade.\n\n3. **Surplus and Scarcity Analysis**:\n   - Player 1 has:\n     - High quantity of Brick (22) and Sheep (21) \u2014 may be less scarce.\n     - Moderate Ore (19) \u2014 high individual value, so parting with it should yield strong returns.\n     - Wood is low (7) \u2014 below average, so gaining Wood is beneficial.\n     - Wheat is not requested by anyone yet, but has low value.\n\n4. **Counterparty Behavior**:\n   - Player 0 has repeatedly tried to get Ore in exchange for low-value items (1 Sheep + 1 Wood = 23 value for 38 Ore \u2192 bad for P1).\n   - Later offers: 1 Brick (24) for 1 Ore (38) \u2014 still a loss for P1.\n   - Then 2 Wood for 1 Brick: P1 gives 24, gets 18 \u2014 net loss of 6 \u2192 reject.\n   - P1's own offer: 1 Brick (24) for 2 Sheep (28) and 1 Wood (9) = total 37 \u2192 net gain of 13 \u2192 favorable.
