This was a good offer for them (net +22 for them) and not great for me (net +22 value for *me*). I rejected it, which was a reasonable decision as I might be able to get more. My current Brick quantity is high, so acquiring more isn't my primary goal unless the value gain is substantial.\n    *   I offered: 3 Wheat (18) + 3 Wood (24) = 42 value -> 2 Ore (70 value). This was an excellent offer for me (net +28 value) as it converted my lowest-value resources into my highest. Player 0 rejected it, likely because it was too good for me and not beneficial enough for them.\n6.  **Negotiation Tactics:**\n    *   **Be Patient but Persistent:** Continue to propose trades that are favorable to me.\n    *   **Identify Opponent's Needs (Inferred):** Player 0 sought Brick in their offer. This could indicate they value Brick highly or need it for specific builds.\n    *   **Anchor:** My previous offer for 2 Ore for low-value resources set a benchmark.\n    *   **Be Flexible within Goals:** While I want Ore, I should be open to other trades that significantly increase my value, even if they don't involve Ore directly (e.g., getting a lot of Brick for low-value resources).\n    *   **Avoid Overpaying:** Never give up high-value resources for a net loss or minimal gain.\n7.  **Current Situation:** Player 0 made no offer. This means I need to initiate. I have the initiative.\n\nApplying Knowledge to Decision:\n\nMy primary goal is to acquire Ore. My lowest value resources are Wheat and Wood. I have a good quantity of them. Player 0 previously showed interest in Brick. While I have plenty of Brick, I should try to move my low-value resources first.\n\nI will try a similar offer to my last one, but perhaps slightly adjusted to make it more appealing to Player 0 while still being very beneficial to me. I want to convert my lowest value resources (Wheat/Wood) into my highest value resource (Ore).\n\nLast turn, I offered 3 Wheat (18) + 3 Wood (24) = 42 value for 2 Ore (70 value), which was a +28 value gain for me. Player 0 rejected.\n\nLet's consider alternative beneficial trades:\n*   Trading low-value for high-value: I want Ore.\n*   Trading low-value for intermediate-value if the quantity is high enough to result in a good total value gain.\n\nMy previous offer was 42 value for 70 value (+28 for me). Player 0 likely found this too unbalanced. I need to make it more appealing to them without sacrificing too much of my gain.\n\nLet's try to increase what I offer slightly while still targeting Ore.\nInstead of 6 total low-value items, maybe 7 or 8.\n\nOffer: 4 Wheat (24) + 3 Wood (24) = 48 value. Still request 2 Ore (70 value). This would be a +22 value gain for me. This is still very good for me and makes the overall trade value slightly more balanced (48 vs 70).\n\nOr, I could try to get just 1 Ore for fewer resources, e.g., 3 Wheat + 2 Wood for 1 Ore (18+16 = 34 vs 35). This is almost perfectly balanced, but smaller gain for me. I'd rather aim higher.\n\nGiven Player 0 rejected my previous 42 for 70 offer, I need to make it closer for them.\nOriginal offer: 3 Wheat (18) + 3 Wood (24) = 42. Request: 2 Ore (70). Value diff: +28 for me.\nNew proposal idea: Offer more low-value resources for the same 2 Ore.\nIf I offer 4 Wheat and 4 Wood: (24 + 32 = 56). Request 2 Ore (70). Value diff: +14 for me. This is a smaller gain but might be more acceptable to Player 0. It's still converting my lowest value resources into my highest.\n\nLet's go with an offer that still provides a solid value increase for me and moves more of my abundant low-value resources.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 2 Ore]",

P0 wants to gain 22 value. You rejected, good.\n    *   You offered: 3 Wheat (18), 3 Wood (24) = 42 -> 2 Ore (70). You want to gain 28 value. P0 rejected. This suggests P0 values Wheat/Wood higher or Ore lower, or just doesn't want to give up 2 Ore for that.\n    *   You offered: 4 Wheat (24), 4 Wood (32) = 56 -> 2 Ore (70). You want to gain 14 value. P0 rejected. This indicates P0 is not willing to give up 2 Ore for 4 Wheat and 4 Wood, or they value their Ore much higher. The proposed value gain for you is diminishing, suggesting you are getting closer to what P0 might consider fair, but still not quite there.

Increasing your Ore quantity is a direct path to increasing overall value.\n    *   **Manage Inventory:** Avoid getting too low on any single resource, but don't be afraid to trade quantities of lower-value resources if the exchange is favorable.\n\n6.  **Negotiation Tactics:**\n    *   **Start with a clear target:** You want Ore.\n    *   **Be flexible on what you offer:** Since P0 rejected 4 Wheat/4 Wood for 2 Ore, you need to either offer more value on your side, or reduce the number of Ore requested, or change the resource type you are offering.\n    *   **Consider offering a mix of resources:** Sometimes, offering 1 high-value + 1 low-value might be more appealing than 2 of the same low-value resource.\n    *   **Don't overpay:** Calculate the value of what you offer vs. what you receive. You must gain value.\n    *   **Patience:** If an advantageous trade isn't available, sometimes waiting is better than making a bad trade. However, there are only 10 turns.\n\n7.  **Re-evaluate your offer for Ore:** P0 is valuing 2 Ore at more than 56 (4 Wheat + 4 Wood). This means P0 sees their 2 Ore as worth more than 70, or your 4 Wheat / 4 Wood as worth less than 56. Given your limited Ore, it's a critical resource for you. You need to make a more enticing offer for Ore.\n    *   What about 1 Ore? Can you get 1 Ore for something worthwhile?\n    *   What if you offer Sheep or Brick, which have higher values?\n    *   Example: 1 Brick (22) and 3 Wood (24) = 46. If you get 1 Ore (35), you lose value.\n    *   Example: 1 Sheep (16) and 3 Brick (66) = 82. If you get 2 Ore (70), you lose value.\n    *   You need to offer resources that *you* value less for resources *you* value more.\n\nLet's try to get Ore. P0 isn't biting on Wheat/Wood. I have a lot of Sheep and Brick, which are higher value. Maybe use some of those to get Ore.\n\nConsider trading 1 Ore instead of 2.\nFor 1 Ore (35 value):\n*   Could offer: 2 Sheep (32) + 1 Wheat (6) = 38. You gain 3 value. P0 loses 3 value.\n*   Could offer: 1 Sheep (16) + 3 Wood (24) = 40. You gain 5 value. P0 loses 5 value.\n\nLet's try to offer a mix that might be more appealing.

Still no value gain for you.\n\nThis implies P0 values Ore highly or you need to offer something more targeted.\nWhat if I offer a mix of lower value resources, but a higher quantity, aiming for a small value increase for Player 0?\nP0 rejected 4 Wheat, 4 Wood for 2 Ore (value 70 for you, 56 for P0).\n\nThe previous offers for 2 Ore were significantly undervaluing P0's Ore from their perspective (based on rejections).\nI have a significant amount of Sheep and Brick. I should be able to leverage them.\n\nLet's reconsider the ratio: 1 Ore (35) is roughly 1.59 Brick (22), or 2.18 Sheep (16).\n\nIf I offer 1 Brick, it's worth 22. Not enough for 1 Ore.\nIf I offer 2 Sheep, it's worth 32. Close to 1 Ore (35).\nIf I offer 1 Sheep (16) + 2 Wheat (12) = 28. Still not enough for 1 Ore.\n\nIt seems I need to offer something that costs *me* less than 35, but is appealing to Player 0.\nMy current ratios mean that trading Wheat/Wood directly for Ore is very inefficient if P0 wants a fair value exchange.\n\nLet's try to get 1 Ore.\nMy last two offers were rejected. This means the value proposition was not attractive enough for Player 0.\nI want to increase my Ore, as it's the highest value missing resource.\n\nWhat if I aim for a very small value increase, hoping P0 accepts?\nOffer: 5 Wood (40) -> 1 Ore (35). I lose 5 value. Bad.\nOffer: 4 Wood (32) + 1 Wheat (6) = 38 -> 1 Ore (35). I lose 3 value. Bad.\n\nWhat trade will increase my value?\nExample: Offer 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (35). I gain 5 value. This is a great deal for me. P0 losses 5 value. Unlikely P0 accepts.\n\nWhat about a small amount of Sheep, and a larger amount of Wheat?\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\nYour cost: 6 Wheat (36) + 1 Sheep (16) = 52\nYour gain: 1 Ore (35)\nYou lose 17 value. Bad.\n\nThis is difficult because Player 0 seems to be valuing their Ore very highly in their rejections.\nMy goal is to increase my value. If I can't get Ore at a good rate, maybe I aim for Brick or Sheep?\n\nI have 18 Wheat, 18 Wood, 21 Sheep, 19 Brick, 11 Ore.\nI want to increase my overall value (1391).\n\nIf I target Brick:\nI want to give value X, receive value Y, where Y > X.\nTarget: 1 Brick (22 value)\nOffer: 3 Wheat (18) + 1 Wood (8) = 26. Gain 4 value. P0 loses 4 value.\nThis is a small gain for me, and a small loss for P0. Might be acceptable.\n\nLet's try to make a trade that *is* a small gain for *me* (Player 1), aiming for Player 0 to accept.\nMy earlier offers for Ore were rejected, implying P0 wants more than 4 Wheat and 4 Wood (total 56) for 2 Ore (total 70).\nThis suggests P0 values their Ore such that 2 Ore is worth > 56, or they value my Wheat/Wood lower.\n\nI want Ore. I have plenty of Sheep and Brick.\nMaybe I can offer a high quantity of low-value resources for a single high-value resource.\nLet's try for 1 Ore.\nValue of 1 Ore = 35. To gain value, I must offer < 35.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nMy cost: 5 * 6 = 30 (Wheat) + 1 * 8 = 8 (Wood) = 38\nMy gain: 1 * 35 = 35 (Ore)\nI *lose* 3 value. This is a bad trade.\n\nI need to offer less value than I receive.\nThis is proving difficult with Player 0's past rejections.\n\nWhat if I offer a resource that P0 wants, but at a fair or slightly advantageous rate for me?\nP0 offered: 3 Wheat (18), 3 Sheep (48) -> 4 Brick (88). Their offer was to lose 22 value. That's why I rejected.\nThis tells me that P0 is willing to give up Brick for Sheep and Wheat.\n\nWhat if I offer Sheep for Brick, but *I* gain value?\nCurrent scenario:\n[Wheat] Qty: 18 Value: 6\n[Wood] Qty: 18 Value: 8\n[Sheep] Qty: 21 Value: 16\n[Brick] Qty: 19 Value: 22\n[Ore] Qty: 11 Value: 35\n\nI have plenty of Sheep. Can I exchange Sheep for Brick and gain value?\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nValue of 1 Sheep = 16\nValue of 1 Brick = 22\nI gain 6 value. P0 loses 6 value. This is a great deal for me.\nIs this likely to be accepted by P0, who previously offered to give up 4 Brick for Sheep and Wheat (losing 22 value)?\nThis is an aggressive offer. P0 might value Brick more than Sheep.\n\nLet's try a different high-value target (Brick).\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nMy cost: 2*8=16 (Wood) + 2*6=12 (Wheat) = 28\nMy gain: 1*22 = 22 (Brick)\nI lose 6 value. This is also a bad trade.\n\nThe only way to ensure I gain value is to offer resources whose combined value is less than the resource I receive.\nGiven the relative values, this is hard when targeting high-value resources with low-value resources.\n\nLet's try again for Ore, but with a more balanced offer (value-wise), hoping for a small gain for me.\nI had 4 Wheat (24) + 4 Wood (32) = 56 for 2 Ore (70). P0 rejected. This means the 14 value gain for me was too much for P0.\nWhat if I offer 5 Wheat + 5 Wood? (30+40=70) for 2 Ore (70). This is a net 0 value trade for both. I gain higher value resources, but my total value doesn't change. This isn't my goal.\n\nI must *increase* my total value.\n\nTo get 1 Ore (35 value), I need to offer something less than 35.\n*   5 Wheat (30). If accepted, I gain 5 value. This is a strong offer for me, a bad one for P0.\n*   4 Wood (32). If accepted, I gain 3 value. Better offer for both.\n\nLet's try 4 Wood -> 1 Ore.\nThis is a very simple offer. P0 might accept if they need Wood.\nI gain 3 value. P0 loses 3 value. This is a reasonable \"fair\" trade that allows me to increment my Ore.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

Ore is my most valuable resource, and Wheat is the least valuable. This dictates what I should be willing to give up and what I should aim to acquire.\n3.  **Scarcity/Abundance:** I have significant quantities of Wheat, Wood, and Sheep, and reasonable quantities of Brick and Ore. I might be more willing to part with abundant, lower-value resources to gain scarcer, higher-value ones.\n4.  **Target Resources:** My previous offers indicate a desire for Ore. Player 0's offer of 1 Ore confirms they might have it. Ore is highly valuable, so acquiring it is a good strategic goal provided the cost is reasonable. Brick is also valuable.\n5.  **Evaluating Offers (Player 0's current offer):**\n    *   Player 0 offers: 1 Ore (Value: 35)\n    *   Player 0 requests: 2 Brick (Value: 2*22 = 44) + 4 Wheat (Value: 4*6 = 24) = 68\n    *   This is a massively unfavorable trade for me (giving up 68 value for 35 value).

I need to find a sweet spot that benefits me but is also appealing enough for Player 0 to consider.\n7.  **Finding a Mutually Beneficial Zone (for my next offer):**\n    *   Player 0 offered 1 Ore. This tells me they might be willing to part with Ore.\n    *   My previous offers for Ore were rejected. My last offer was 6 Wheat (36) + 1 Sheep (16) = 52 for 1 Ore (35). This was also unfavorable to me, but Player 0 still rejected it, suggesting they value Ore even more or value my offered resources less.\n    *   I need to propose a trade where I gain more value than I lose, and it's enticing enough for Player 0.

They want Brick. Maybe I can leverage this.\n    *   My last offer 6 Wheat (36) + 1 Sheep (16) = 52 for 1 Ore (35 value). I was overpaying. I should not overpay for Ore if I want to maximize value.\n\nDecision:\nPlayer 0's offer (1 Ore for 2 Brick, 4 Wheat) is extremely unfavorable to me (35 value for 68 value). I must reject it.\n\nGiven my ongoing struggle to acquire Ore and Player 0's high valuation of it (evident from their offers and rejection of even my overvalued previous offers), and my strong desire to increase my total value, I need to try a different approach, or be extremely careful not to overpay for Ore.\n\nSince Player 0 is clearly asking for a lot of value in exchange for their Ore, I need to find an offer that balances my desire for Ore with the principle of value maximization. I have plenty of Wheat and Wood. Player 0 seems to value Brick.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again, but be more realistic about what Player 0 might accept, while still making a net gain OR breaking even.\nTarget: 1 Ore (Value 35).\nWhat can I give of similar or slightly less value?\n*   5 Wood (40) is too much.\n*   4 Wood (32) + 1 Wheat (6) = 38 (close, but still overpaying slightly)\n*   2 Sheep (32) + 1 Wheat (6) = 38 (overpaying)\n*   1 Sheep (16) + 3 Wood (24) = 40 (overpaying)\n\nI need to make sure I *gain* value. This means what I give up must be less than 35.\nLet's re-evaluate. I have 11 Ore.

I have Brick. My Brick is valuable (22).\n\nMaybe I can propose exchanging my lower-value resources for their higher-value resources.\nMy large quantity of low value items (Wheat, Wood) could be leveraged.\n\nGiven the current offer by Player 0, I must reject it as it's a huge loss for me.\nThen I need to make a new offer that still benefits me, but might be more palatable.\nThey asked for Brick and Wheat. I have lots of Wheat.\n\nLet's try to get more Sheep or Brick, as they are higher value than Wheat/Wood, and might be more achievable than Ore.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (30) for 2 Sheep (32).

Player 0 still rejected it.\nThis implies Player 0 values their Ore exceedingly highly, or they desperately need low value resources.\n\nWhat if I offer a lot of low-value resources for a single high-value resource?\n1 Ore is 35.\nCan I give fewer valuable things?\n4 Wood (32) for 1 OR (35)?

Brick is also valuable, and I have a decent amount, but Ore is my highest value per unit.\n3.  **Understanding Opponent's Offers:** Player 0 has consistently offered Ore for combinations of Brick and Wheat. This suggests Player 0 values Ore highly and might be trying to obtain it, or perhaps has an abundance of Brick and Wheat. Previous offers from Player 0 (1 Ore -> 2 Brick, 4 Wheat; 1 Ore -> 2 Brick, 1 Wheat) tried to get more value for Ore, but my goal is to get Ore cheaper. Their current offer indicates their willingness to part with Ore for less Wheat.\n4.  **Assessing Opponent's Needs (Hypothesis):** Given Player 0's consistent offers for Ore, it's highly likely they need Ore or see it as very valuable. This is a strong bargaining chip for me. They seem willing to part with Brick and Wheat for it.\n5.  **Bargaining Strategy:** I've been trying to get Ore. Player 0 has been trying to get rid of Ore (or perhaps trade it for specific resources). Their latest offer (1 Ore -> 2 Brick, 1 Wheat) is closer to a fairer trade for me, but I still want to maximize my gain. My previous offers tried to get Ore for low-value resources (Wheat, Wood, Sheep). Player 0 has rejected offers that give them only low-value items.\n6.  **Current Offer Analysis:** Player 0 is offering 1 Ore for 2 Brick and 1 Wheat.\n    *   Value of 1 Ore = 35\n    *   Value of 2 Brick + 1 Wheat = (2 * 22) + (1 * 6) = 44 + 6 = 50\n    *   This trade means I would lose 50 value to gain 35 value, resulting in a net loss of 15 value. This is a bad trade for me. I must reject this.\n7.  **Prioritization:** My goal is to acquire Ore. I have a lot of low-value resources and a significant amount of high-value Sheep and Brick. I previously offered 4 Wood for 1 Ore (value 32 for 35, good for me, bad for P0). I need to find a sweet spot where Player 0 feels they are getting value, but I am getting more value.\n8.  **Negotiation Patience:** This is turn 8, there are only 2 more turns left after this. I need to get a good trade.\n9.  **Formulating a new offer:** Player 0 wants Brick and Wheat. I have plenty of Wheat. I also have enough Brick. I want Ore.\n\nApplying Knowledge and Making Decision:\nPlayer 0's offer of 1 Ore for 2 Brick and 1 Wheat is a clear loss for me in terms of value (50 for 35). I must deny this.\n\nConsidering Player 0's consistent offers where they ask for Brick and Wheat in exchange for Ore, and my desire for Ore, I should attempt to find a balance. I have a high quantity of Wheat and Wood. I have a fair amount of Sheep and Brick. My Ore is low.\n\nMy previous offer of 4 Wood for 1 Ore (value 32 for 35) was good for me but rejected by P0, likely because they value Ore highly.\nPlayer 0's last rejected offer from me was 6 Wheat, 1 Sheep for 1 Ore (Value 6*6 + 1*16 = 36 + 16 = 52, to gain 35. This was a bad offer for me, but P0 still rejected it, indicating they want *less* for their Ore or *different* resources).\n\nPlayer 0 consistently asks for Brick and Wheat for Ore. I have plenty of Wheat and a decent supply of Brick. I want Ore.\nLet's try to offer a higher quantity of lower-value resources for Ore, which is consistent with my abundance.\n\nConsider offering a significant amount of my most abundant, low-value resource (Wheat) and some other low-value resource (Wood) for Ore.\n\nMy goal is to obtain Ore for less than 35 value, or to trade away much lower-value items for it.\nLet's analyze Player 0's desire for Brick and/or Wheat. They offered 1 Ore (35) for 2 Brick (44) and 1 Wheat (6), total 50. This means they are willing to give up 35 value for 50 value. This is a very bad trade for me.\n\nI need to make an offer that feels beneficial to Player 0 but is still a net gain for me in value.\nPlayer 0 wants Brick and Wheat. I have Wheat and Brick. I also have plenty of Wood.\n\nHow much Wheat for 1 Ore?\nIf I offer 5 Wheat (30 value) for 1 Ore (35 value), I gain 5 value. This is better for me, but P0 loses 5 value.\nIf I offer 6 Wheat (36 value) for 1 Ore (35 value), I lose 1 value, but it's close to even. P0 might accept this as it's a minor gain for them.\nIf I offer 6 Wheat and 1 Wood (36+8=44) for 1 Ore (35), it's a clear loss for me.\n\nPlayer 0's prior offer: 1 Ore for 2 Brick, 1 Wheat (value 35 for 50). They are willing to take a significant gain.\nMy previous offers: 4 Wood for 1 Ore (32 for 35), 6 Wheat, 1 Sheep for 1 Ore (52 for 35, bad for me, good for them, still rejected).\n\nLet's try to offer a good amount of low-value resources. I have plenty of Wheat and Wood.\nWhat if I offer 8 Wheat (48 value) for 1 Ore (35 value)? I lose 13 value. Still not good for me.\n\nI must make an offer that results in a net value gain for me.\nMy current resources: Wheat (6), Wood (8), Sheep (16), Brick (22), Ore (35).\nI have 18 Wheat, 18 Wood.\nIf Player 0 is looking for *quantity* of resources to build, then I can offer more of my low-value, high-quantity resources.\n\nLet's stick to the principle of getting Ore for the lowest possible value.\nMy previous offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore (32 for 35) was a gain for me and was rejected.\nPlayer 0's desired resources seem to be Brick and Wheat.\n\nWhat if I offer a mix that is slightly better for Player 0 than pure low-value goods, but still benefits me?\nMy Ore is my lowest quantity and highest value. I want more of it.\n\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (32) for 1 Ore (35), I gain 3 value. This seems fair for me. Player 0 gets slightly less value for their Ore. This might be acceptable. Sheep are abundant for me.\n\nLet's try to trade Sheep for Ore as I have 21 Sheep, and Sheep's value is 16, which is higher than Wheat/Wood, making it a potentially more attractive offer to P0 than just vast quantities of low value items, but it's still less than Brick or Ore.\n\nI'll try 2 Sheep and 1 Wheat.\nValue: (2 * 16) + (1 * 6) = 32 + 6 = 38.\nIf I give 38 value, to get 35 value of Ore, I lose 3 value. Not my goal.\n\nI need to make a tempting offer for Player 0 that increases my net value.\nWhat if I offer slightly more Wheat or Wood?\nMy last previous offer was 4 Wood for 1 Ore. That was a small gain for me.\n\nI will try to make an offer that feels generous to Player 0 while still resulting in a net gain for me, or at least a minimal loss if I am desperate for Ore. However, I am not desperate enough to take a losing trade.\n\nLet's try to offer only one type of resource that I have a lot of and is relatively low value.\nPlayer 0 offered 1 Ore for 2 Brick and 1 Wheat.\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick and 2 Wheat for 1 Ore?\nMy loss: 1 Brick (22) + 2 Wheat (12) = 34. I gain 1 Ore (35). Net gain of 1 value. This is a very small gain, but it is a gain and involves resources P0 seems to want.\n\nLet's try this. This is the least I can offer (in terms of specific resource composition P0 seems to want) while still gaining value.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Brick, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\nKey principles for the current situation  \n1. Marginal-value focus:   \n   - I have only 5 Ore, the highest-value item (33), and value density 6.6. Each Ore lost hurts roughly twice as much as I gain in Brick (value 24 \u2192 3 each) or Wheat (6 \u2192 1 each).  \n   - Brick is scarce/stacks well; I have only 8, but still high value (24). Trading **into** Brick is acceptable if payoff exceeds Ore sacrifice.\n\n2. Trades must beat 33 Opportunity-Cost Ore : x Brick + y Wheat +\u2026 such that 33 \u2264 24x + 6y + ...\n\n3. Concession versus value-maximization:  \n   - Player 1 keeps offering me Wheat/Wood for Ore at constant 4-to-1 ratios (4 Wheat/Wood for 1 Ore). Those always lose value (4 Wheat=24 < 33).  \n   - His last offer dropped to 1 Brick + 2 Wheat = 24+12 = 36. This *seems* slightly positive (+3 = 9%).  \n   - However, Brick is the resource I most want (I\u2019m lightest on it). Giving up the 5th Ore would leave me with 4, increasing scarcity.\n\n4. Psychological/Colonel Blotto insight:  \n   - After repeated rebuffs, he is inching offers closer to parity. If I accept now, he may respect floor of ~36 value in future turns rather than offering the repeated 24-value ones. \u201cSmall concessions now vs bigger ones later\u201d.\n\n5. Endgame turns:  \n   - The game lasts only 10 turns. Current reject history: Step 10 not reached; we must be on turn ~8/9. Accepting a +3 deal that appears fair could still be smart if we have 2-3 turns left and need flexibility.\n\nDecision Calculation for most recent offer (1 Brick + 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore):\n\n   Ore lost: \u221233  \n   Brick gained: +24  \n   Wheat gained: +12  \n   Net = +3.\n\nEven though it\u2019s marginal (+9 %), Brick is my bottleneck. Accepting would leave  \n   Ore 4, Brick 9, Wheat 20 \u2013 still viable. Stingy rejecting would keep Ore 5, Brick 8, Wheat 18 \u2013 no immediate downside beyond that.\n\nHierarchy:  \n   1. Edge gain (>\u224820-30%): reject.  \n   2. Slippery slope imminent, but value positive \u2192 accept small gain.  \n\nWe\u2019re in category 2.\n\n[Accept]",
