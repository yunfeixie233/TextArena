Current per-unit values: Wheat (5), Wood (10), Sheep (17), Brick (22), Ore (36). \n- **Resource Abundance Strategy**: Leverage high-quantity, low-value resources (e.g., 23 Wheat) as bargaining chips, as trading them incurs minimal scarcity risk. Preserve scarce higher-value resources (e.g., only 7 Sheep) unless trading unlocks disproportionate gains.\n- **Negotiation Leverage**: Propose \"win-win\" trades by offering bulk low-value resources for fewer high-value ones, appealing to partners who may undervalue high-tier resources or need staple goods (e.g., Wheat/Wood).  \n- **Trade Scalability**: Start moderately to test opponent receptiveness (e.g., small trades first), then escalate in future turns. Focus on Ore/Brick due to their high value and current holdings (23 Ore, 14 Brick).  \n- **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid trading Ore unless the return significantly exceeds its value (36), and ensure no net value loss in any trade.

      "response": "### Knowledge Generation\n\nWhen engaging in resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies can be applied:\n\n1. **Resource Value Assessment**: Understanding the value of the resources in terms of their utility and demand in the game is crucial. High-value resources are typically preferred, while lower-value resources may be traded more readily.\n\n2. **Supply and Demand**: Identifying what the other player may need and how your own resources meet those needs can create mutually beneficial trades. Pay attention to trends and scarcity of certain resources.\n\n3. **Leverage**: Utilizing the most valuable resources in your offerings can sway the negotiation in your favor. Ensure that you are not giving away too much while still enticing the other player.\n\n4. **Strategic Offers**: Make offers that are perceived as beneficial to both parties. Creating an offer that helps the other player could also lead to future trades down the line.\n\n5. **Incremental Gambits**: If the trading value is uncertain, start with smaller trades to gauge the other player's willingness to negotiate without revealing too much or risking significant losses.\n\n6. **Building Relationships**: Being polite and appreciative in negotiations can lead to better offers in the future. Cooperation might yield greater benefits in the long run than cutthroat strategies.\n\n### Trading Decision\n\nPlayer 0's offer was for:\n- Offered items: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood \n- Requested item: 1 Ore\n\n#### Evaluation of the Offer:\n1. **Your Resources**:\n   - Wheat: Qty 10, Value 5 each\n   - Wood: Qty 24, Value 12 each\n   - Ore: Qty 12, Value 40 each\n\n2. **Value Calculation**:\n   - 4 Wheat = 4 * 5 = 20\n   - 1 Wood = 12\n   - Total value offered = 20 + 12 = 32\n   - 1 Ore = 40 value\n\n3. **Comparison**: \n   - You would be giving up resources worth 32 in exchange for an Ore worth 40. However, this exchange would deplete your Wheat and Wood reserves without balance. \n\n#### Conclusion:\nWhile the promotion of acquiring an Ore (valued at 40) seems beneficial, the resources you would lose (totaling more than half your wheat stock) make this an unbalanced offer in terms of long-term strategy and resource management. Hence, you must be interested in preserving your low-value resources for further future trades or for immediate needs.\n  \nTherefore, I will respond to the offer as follows:\n\n[Deny]",

Aim for positive net value gain per trade.\n- **Resource Liquidity**: Leverage surplus low-value resources (e.g., Wheat, 23 quantity) to acquire higher-value ones, reducing excess while maximizing value growth.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid trading high-value resources (Ore:36) unless receiving disproportionately high returns. Protect resources with higher per-unit value.\n- **Negotiation Psychology**: After a rejection, adjust offers incrementally. Test alternative resource combinations, especially targeting mid-to-high-value resources (Sheep:17, Brick:22) if initial high-value (Ore) bids fail.\n- **Portfolio Balancing**: While value is paramount, moderate resources (Sheep, quantity:7) offer flexibility; acquiring more can diversify without sacrificing value. Avoid hoarding low-utility resources.\n- **Efficiency Over Volume**: Smaller, high-margin trades (e.g., gaining 1\u20132 units of high-value resources) are preferable to large, low-margin offers, minimizing rejection risk and preserving stock.\n\n### Trading Decision\nBased on the principles above:\n- **Previous offer rejected**: Proposed \"4 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore\" (net value: give 4\u00d75 + 10 = 30, get 36, net +6 for you).

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge: Key Principles and Strategies for Resource Trading\n1. **Value Maximization Principle**: Prioritize trades that increase your total resource value. Trade away lower-value resources for higher-value ones, as expressed by your per-unit valuations (Wheat: 5, Wood: 10, Sheep: 17, Brick: 22, Ore: 36). Net value gain should be positive (received value > given value).\n\n2. **Leverage Resource Abundance**: Utilize your high-quantity, low-value resources (e.g., Wheat, 23 units) to acquire scarce, higher-value resources. Trading Wheat (value 5) for Sheep (value 17) or Brick (value 22) could yield gains, but avoid overpaying (e.g., too much Wheat for one unit may not be accepted).\n\n3. **Negotiation Insights from Rejections**:\n   - Previous offers rejected (e.g., 4 Wheat + 1 Wood [30 total value] for 1 Ore [36 value] and 3 Wheat [15 value] for 1 Sheep [17 value]) suggest Player 1 undervalues Wheat or has different priorities. Adjust by offering Wheat in larger quantities per Sheep to make it appealing, but ensure the trade still benefits you.\n   - Player 1's lack of counteroffers indicates they may be conservative\u2014sweeten deals with higher quantities of low-value items to incentivize acceptance without sacrificing your value goals.\n\n4. **Risk Management**: Since the game has 10 turns, experiment with modest offers early to probe Player 1's preferences, but focus on high-potential gains. Avoid trading your scarce high-value resources (e.g., Sheep at 7 units or Ore at 23 but high value) unless receiving disproportionate value in return.\n\n5. **Strategic Targeting**: Sheep (value 17) is a mid-high value target to accumulate, as it offers more flexibility than Wheat/Wood. For example, Sheep could later be bundled for Brick or Ore. Targeting multiple units per trade (e.g., 2 Sheep) can accelerate this compared to single-unit offers.\n\n6. **Optimal Trade Structure**: Propose balanced offers that minimize your value sacrifice, such as:\n   - **High gain**: 5 Wheat (value 25) for 2 Sheep (value 34) \u2192 net +9 value.\n   - **Low risk**: Offers using only abundant resources (Wheat) reduce downside if rejected.\n\n### Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge, I propose the following trade to Player 1. I offer a large quantity of low-value Wheat to entice acceptance while ensuring a net value gain for myself (25 value given vs. 34 received). This builds on the previous Sheep rejections by increasing the offer to 2 Sheep, which may align better with Player 1's perceived valuation.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]",

Here's the synthesized knowledge relevant to my situation:\n\n1. **Value Maximization Principle**: Prioritize trades where the received resources' total value (based on my valuation) exceeds the given resources' value. This directly increases my total worth.\n2. **Leverage Surplus Resources**: Wheat (value 5) is my most abundant resource (Qty 23) but has the lowest value. Offloading excess Wheat for higher-value resources (Sheep:17, Brick:22, Ore:36) is efficient, but past rejections indicate Wheat may be undervalued by others.\n3. **Scarcity and Demand**: Sheep (Qty 7, value 17) and Brick (Qty 14, value 22) are moderately scarce for me. Acquiring more of these boosts my value, but Brick has higher marginal utility due to its value-to-quantity ratio.\n4. **Negotiation Psychology**: Repeated rejections (3\u00d7) of Wheat-for-Sheep offers signal Player 1 undervalues Wheat. Introducing Wood (value 10, Qty 13) as a \"sweetener\" could bridge the gap\u2014Wood is higher-value than Wheat but less critical for me.\n5. **Trade Feasibility**: Aim for mutually plausible ratios.

For example, if 1 Sheep is worth more in terms of its utility than 3 Wheat, it could be beneficial to make a trade that prioritizes obtaining Sheep.\n\n4. **Assessment of Opponent's Needs**: Analyzing what resources the other player values can provide a basis for your offers. If you know they need certain resources, you can create a deal that seems favorable to them but still benefits you.\n\n5. **Trade Volume Strategy**: Consider that smaller trades can lead to a larger overall benefit in the long term. Striking multiple smaller trades rather than relying on a single large trade could yield greater overall value.\n\n**Trading Decision:**\n\nGiven that Player 0 seems focused on acquiring Sheep through trades that do not value their resources highly, and based on their latest offer of (3 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Sheep), I can counter with an offer that reflects my surplus resources while meeting their needs, thus potentially increasing my own resource value.\n\nI will make the following trade offer to Player 0:\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Sheep] \n\nThe reasoning for this offer is based on the following considerations:\n- I have a surplus of Wood (24 Wood).\n- The trade would allow me to acquire a Sheep which may also increase my positioning for future trades and is valuable against Player 0's needs. \n\nI await Player 0's response to my offer.",

      "response": "**Generate Knowledge:**\n\n1. **Value Assessment**: Before trading, evaluate the value of the offered resources compared to the requested resources. In negotiation, try to ensure that the value of what you give away is less than the value of what you receive.\n\n2. **Scarcity vs. Abundance**: If you have an excess of a particular resource that other players need, you may have more leverage in negotiations. Conversely, resources that are scarce for you may be more valuable to hold on to.\n\n3. **Negotiation Positioning**: Always assess your own and your opponent's position. If your opponent has a surplus of something, they might be less inclined to trade for it when you approach them.\n\n4. **Offering Threshold**: Aim to make reasonable offers that are hard to refuse. The more appealing your offer seems, considering both parties, the greater the likelihood of acceptance.\n\n5. **Building Rapport**: Establish a goodwill approach where you may open negotiations favorably and build on previous interactions \u2014 being respectful and understanding of the other player's needs can aid future trades.\n\n**Trading Decision:**\n\nAfter analyzing my current resources, my key priorities should include maximizing my high-value resources (like Ore and Brick) and ensuring I maintain sufficient Wheat for potential future trades.\n\nGiven that Player 0 has a repeated interest in Sheep (which I have), and I have limited Wheat, it might be wise to consider trading my Wood, which has a decent value but isn't as crucial to my strategy right now.\n\nBased on that, I will make a new offer:\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Sheep]\n\nThis offers Player 0 the material they seem to want, while I secure a resource that has utility for future trades or plays in the game. \n\n**Final Action:**\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Sheep]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\nTo make an informed trading decision, I consider the following key principles of resource trading and negotiation based on my current resource valuations and the history of offers:\n\n1. **Value Maximization Principle**: Prioritize trades that yield a net gain in total value based on your subjective valuations. Always calculate the net value change: (Value gained) - (Value given up). Accept trades where net gain > 0, as they directly increase asset wealth without relying on future, uncertain trades.\n   \n2. **Liquidity and Scarcity Awareness**: \n   - High-quantity resources (e.g., 23 Wheat, 23 Ore) can be traded more freely, as depletion is less risky.\n   - Moderate-quantity resources (e.g., 7 Sheep) require caution\u2014trade only if net gain is substantial, as a resource below a critical stock (e.g., <5) could limit future flexibility. Sheep at 7 units is safe for 1:1 trades but should preserve at least 5-6 units.\n   \n3. **Strategic Scenario Analysis**:\n   - **Opponent Behavior Insight**: Player 1 repeatedly rejects Wheat-heavy offers and insists on Sheep-for-Wood trades. This suggests:\n     - Player 1 likely values Sheep highly and Wheat poorly, making offers involving Wheat unsuccessful.\n     - Player 1 has surplus Wood and may be willing to overpay for Sheep. Exploit this by accepting profitable Wood-for-Sheep deals.\n   - **Failed Offers Lesson**: Past attempts to trade Wheat/Wood for Sheep/Ore failed. Redirect focus to **accepting incoming high-value proposals** rather than pushing low-chance Wheat-based offers.\n\n4. **Turn Economy**: With limited turns (total 10), unpredictable game end, and history of rejections, a guaranteed immediate net gain is preferable to counter-offers. Accepting a profitable proposal is low-risk and conserves turn time.\n\n5. **Risk Appetite**: If a trade offers >20% net value gain above the resource\u2019s base worth (e.g., Sheep at 17 value), it counters \"loss aversion\" bias and justifies depleting a resource. A net gain exceeding this validates acceptance.\n\n### Trading Decision\n**Offer from Player 1**:  \n- Received: 4 Wood \u2192 Value gained = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40  \n- Gave: 1 Sheep \u2192 Value lost = 17  \n- **Net gain = 40 - 17 = +23**  \n\n**Evaluation**:\n- **Value Maximization**: This trade provides a **+23 net gain**, a significant increase (135% ROI on the Sheep\u2019s value).\n- **Scarcity**: Sheep drops from 7 to 6 (still safe), and Wood increases (13 \u2192 17), a non-critical change.\n- **History**: Player 1\u2019s repeated identical offer signals they prioritize Sheep highly. Declining risks losing this gain if turns run out or Player 1 withdraws.\n- **Turn Efficiency**: Accepting ends the trade immediately, avoiding wasted turns on counter-offers that may be rejected.\n\n**Verdict**: The trade substantially boosts value with minimal risk. No better alternative is apparent given Player 1\u2019s rejection pattern.\n\n**[Accept]**",
