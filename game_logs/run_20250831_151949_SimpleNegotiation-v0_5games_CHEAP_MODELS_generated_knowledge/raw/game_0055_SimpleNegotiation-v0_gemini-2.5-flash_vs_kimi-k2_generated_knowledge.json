      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This means any trade must result in a net gain in value.\n2.  **Resource Values:** I have a clear understanding of the value of each resource:\n    *   Wheat: 6\n    *   Wood: 11\n    *   Sheep: 14\n    *   Brick: 25\n    *   Ore: 40\n3.  **High-Value Resources:** Ore (40) and Brick (25) are my most valuable resources per unit. Sheep (14) and Wood (11) are medium, and Wheat (6) is low.\n4.  **Quantity Analysis:**\n    *   Brick: 22 (highest quantity, high value) - Potentially good for offering if I can get higher value in return.\n    *   Wheat: 16 (high quantity, low value) - Good for offering if I need to balance quantities or get rid of low-value assets.\n    *   Wood: 9 (medium quantity, medium value)\n    *   Sheep: 7 (medium quantity, medium value)\n    *   Ore: 7 (lowest quantity, highest value) - I should be cautious about trading Ore unless the return is exceptionally good. I want to acquire more Ore if possible, or trade it for highly concentrated value.\n5.  **Trading Strategy:**\n    *   **Value-up Trading:** Give away lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n    *   **Quantity Management:** Be mindful of not depleting crucial resources, especially if they are high value. Similarly, I might want to reduce quantities of low-value resources if they are abundant.\n    *   **Proposing Offers:** When proposing, aim for clear value gains. Calculate the exact value change for any proposed trade. My proposed offers should be attractive enough for the opponent but still beneficial for me. For example, offering slightly more value than I request can incentivize acceptance.\n    *   **Negotiation Leverage:** My high quantity of Brick and Wheat could be used as leverage. My low quantity of Ore means I should prioritize acquiring it or trade it very carefully.\n    *   **Turn Limit (10 turns):** Each turn is valuable. I should try to make active and beneficial trades rather than waiting too long. Early successful trades can set a good pace.\n\nApply Knowledge:\nMy goal is to increase my total value. My highest value resource is Ore (40), and I have the fewest of these (7). My lowest value resource is Wheat (6), and I have a good quantity of them (16). I also have a large quantity of Brick (22), which has a good value (25).\n\nA good strategy would be to shed lower-value resources like Wheat or Wood, or even some Sheep, for higher-value resources like Ore or Brick, ensuring a net value gain. Alternatively, I can trade some of my abundant high-value Brick for other high-value resources if the exchange is favorable.\n\nLet's consider possible exchanges:\n*   Trading Wheat (6) for anything higher is good.\n*   Trading Wood (11) for anything higher is good.\n*   Trading Sheep (14) for anything higher is good.\n*   Trading Brick (25) for Ore (40) is very good if the ratios are in my favor.\n*   I want to gain Ore.\n\nI have a comfortable amount of Brick. I could offer some Brick to receive Ore, as Ore is more valuable.\nLet's calculate some proposals:\n1.  **Trade 1 Brick (25) for 1 Ore (40):** Net gain = 40 - 25 = +15. This is an excellent trade for me. But Player 1 might find it too imbalanced.\n2.  **Trade 2 Wheat (12) for 1 Wood (11):** Net loss. Bad.\n3.  **Trade 2 Wheat (12) for 1 Sheep (14):** Net gain = +2. Good, but small.\n4.  **Trade 1 Sheep (14) for 1 Wood (11):** Net loss. Bad.\n5.  **Trade 3 Wheat (18) for 1 Brick (25):** Net gain = +7. Good.\n6.  **Trade 2 Brick (50) for 1 Ore (40) + something:** Net loss if only 1 Ore.\n7.  **Trade 1 Brick (25) + 1 Wood (11) = 36 for 1 Ore (40):** Net gain = +4. This isn't bad for me, and Player 1 gets a high-value Brick and a medium-value Wood for their highest value.\n\nMy best strategy is to propose an offer that is clearly beneficial to me but also somewhat appealing to the other player.\nGiven my high quantity of Brick, I can use it to acquire Ore.\n\nLet's propose trading a low-value resource for a higher-value one, or a medium-value for a high-value.\nWhat about offering a couple of my abundant Wheat for something more valuable?\n[Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep] Value offered: 18. Value requested: 14. Net loss for me. No.\n\nI have 22 Brick. I can spare some for a good deal.\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore] Value offered: 25. Value requested: 40. Net gain: +15. This is ideal, but the opponent is unlikely to accept. How about something slightly more balanced but still good for me?\nMaybe offer 2 Brick (50) for 1 Ore (40) and 1 Sheep (14)? Value received: 54. Value offered: 50. Net gain: +4. This is a possibility.\n\nLet's try to acquire Ore, as it's my top priority for increasing value efficiently.\nMy most valuable resource is Ore, and I have the least quantity of it. My second most valuable is Brick, and I have the most of it. This creates a good opportunity to trade Brick for Ore.\n\nOffer: 2 Brick (Value 50) for 1 Ore (Value 40) and 1 Wood (Value 11).\nValue offered: 2 * 25 = 50.\nValue requested: 1 * 40 + 1 * 11 = 51.\nNet gain for me: 51 - 50 = +1. Slightly positive for me, and they get 2 high-value resources. This seems like a reasonable offer that might be accepted.\n\nRefinement: Perhaps the opponent also values Ore highly. I should try to give them something they might also want.\nWhat if I offer a mixed bag of higher quantity, lower unit value resources for fewer, higher unit value resources?\nI have lots of Wheat (16) and Brick (22).\nI want more Ore and possibly more Sheep.\n\nLet's try to ensure a larger net gain if possible while making it attractive.\nIf I offer 3 Sheep (42) and ask for 1 Ore (40) and 1 Wood (11). My value: 42. Their value: 51. Net gain: 9. This is good for me. Player 1 gets 3 Sheep.\n\nConsider a simpler offer using my most abundant resource: Brick.\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]\nValue of 2 Brick = 2 * 25 = 50.\nValue of 1 Ore + 1 Sheep = 40 + 14 = 54.\nNet gain for me = 54 - 50 = +4.\nThis is a clear net gain for me, and Player 1 gets 2 valuable Brick. It feels like a plausible offer.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to get rid of some Wheat for something more valuable.\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nValue of 5 Wheat = 5 * 6 = 30.\nValue of 1 Brick = 25.\nNet loss for me = 25 - 30 = -5. Bad.\n\nSo, the [Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep] is solid gold for me with +4 value.\n\nFinal choice:\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore, 1 Sheep]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade should ideally bring in more value than it gives away.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** I need to know the individual value of each resource.\n    *   Wheat: 6\n    *   Wood: 11\n    *   Sheep: 14\n    *   Brick: 25\n    *   Ore: 40\n3.  **Surplus Identification:** I have 16 Wheat, 9 Wood, 7 Sheep, 22 Brick, and 7 Ore. My previous trade involved giving away Wheat. I still have a large quantity of Wheat and Brick. Ore is my most valuable resource, and I have 7. Brick is also valuable and I have a significant amount.\n4.  **Demand/Supply:** I don't know Player 1's resources yet, but Player 1 accepted my previous offer for Sheep, suggesting they might value Sheep.\n5.  **Strategic Offense/Defense:** I should look for opportunities to trade my less valuable or surplus resources for more valuable or needed resources. I should also be wary of trades that ask for my highly valued resources without offering significant value in return.\n6.  **Incremental Gains:** Even small value gains over multiple turns add up. Don't wait for a \"perfect\" trade if a good one is available.\n7.  **Negotiation Stance:** I can be proactive with offers. Since Player 1 is not making offers, I should continue to initiate.\n8.  **Understanding Past Trade:** My last trade was: 3 Wheat (Value 18) -> 1 Sheep (Value 14). This was a net loss of 4 value. This was a mistake in terms of pure value, but perhaps it served to open negotiations or shed a low-value resource. I need to be more careful about value in this turn. I must *not* make another trade that reduces my total value.\n\nCurrent Resources and Values:\n*   Wheat: 16 (16 * 6 = 96)\n*   Wood: 9 (9 * 11 = 99)\n*   Sheep: 7 (7 * 14 = 98)\n*   Brick: 22 (22 * 25 = 550)\n*   Ore: 7 (7 * 40 = 280)\nTotal Value: 96 + 99 + 98 + 550 + 280 = 1123\n\nMy previous trade: 3 Wheat (18) -> 1 Sheep (14) netted -4.

I also have a lot of Wheat (16), which is my least valuable resource.\n*   I want to increase my total value.\n*   Player 1 accepted Sheep last time. What if I offer Wheat again for something more valuable? Or perhaps Brick.\n*   I should avoid giving up Ore or precious Sheep unless the return is substantial.\n*   Let's consider trading Wheat as it's my lowest value and I have a good quantity. Can I get Wood (11), Sheep (14), Brick (25) or Ore (40)?\n*   A direct value-positive trade would be something like: 1 Wheat (6) for 1/2 Wood (5.5) or 1 Sheep (14) for 2 Wheat (12).\n*   Let's try to trade my surplus Brick for something even more valuable, like Ore.\n    *   1 Brick (25) for 1 Ore (40) is a +15 value trade for me. This is aggressive; Player 1 might deny.\n    *   2 Brick (50) for 1 Ore (40) is a -10 value trade for me. Bad.\n*   Can I trade something less valuable for something more valuable?\n    *   If I offer Wheat: 2 Wheat (12) for 1 Sheep (14) is +2 value. I still have a lot of Wheat. Player 1 seemed to want Sheep. This might be plausible if they still need Sheep and I can gain value.\n    *   3 Wheat (18) for 1 Sheep (14) was my last offer, and I lost value. I must avoid this again.\n    *   How about using my surplus Brick to get Ore?\n        *   If I offer 1 Brick (25) for 1 Ore (40), it's a gain of 15. This is highly favorable to me. Player 1 would only accept if they have an extreme need for Brick or don't value Ore highly. But it's worth trying to maximize.\n        *   What about 2 Brick (50) for 2 Ore (80)? That's +30. But might be too large.\n*   Let's try a smaller, more plausible trade that guarantees value gain.\n    *   I want to get Ore (40) or Sheep (14) or Wood (11).\n    *   I have plenty of Wheat (6) and Brick (25).\n    *   Offer: 2 Wheat (12) -> 1 Sheep (14). Net +2 value. Small but positive.\n    *   Offer: 3 Wheat (18) -> 2 Wood (22). Net +4 value.\n    *   Offer: 1 Wood (11) -> 1 Sheep (14). Net +3 value. I have 9 Wood, not a surplus.\n    *   What about trading Brick for Ore? 1 Brick (25) -> 1 Ore (40) is ambitious but high upside.\n    *   Since I still have a lot of Wheat and Player 1 accepted Sheep previously, let's try to optimize that specific trade to gain value this time.\n\nDecision: I need to ensure a positive value exchange. I will try to offer Wheat for Sheep again, but ensuring it's in my favor this time. My previous value loss was bad.

Negotiation reading of the opponent: Player 0 has twice tried to trade Wheat & Wood for Sheep, suggesting they perceive Sheep as scarce. Not over-exploiting them yet keeps future goodwill.  \n5. Deadline pressure: We are past mid-game (it\u2019s the 10-turn game, only 2\u20133 turns likely remain). Smaller, positive-sum trades are safer than risky block pursuits.\n\nApplying this knowledge:\n\nI do NOT see a higher-value gain available this round; my recent trade already netted me a resource mix that slightly dilutes high-value Ore, but consumed surplus Wood. There is no imminent new configuration that beats what I already hold.\n\nTherefore, I will make no new offer this turn, but keep my option open next turn when the final moves occur.\n\n[Offer: No new offer]",

I should not accept it unless there's a strategic reason (e.g., getting rid of low-value items for higher-value ones, but this isn't the case here).\n\n3.  **Prioritize High-Value Resources:** My goal is to increase my total resource value. I should aim to acquire more of the highest-value resources (Ore, Brick, Sheep) and trade away lower-value resources (Wheat, Wood, possibly some Sheep if I can get a good return).\n\n4.  **Strategic Resource Management:**\n    *   I have a large quantity of Brick (22), which has a high individual value (25). This is my most valuable single resource type. I should be cautious about trading away too much Brick, but it also gives me leverage.\n    *   Ore is my highest per-unit value. Acquiring more Ore is a good strategy.\n    *   Wheat and Wood are my lowest value resources. These are good candidates to offer in trades.\n\n5.  **Past Trade Analysis:**\n    *   My previous offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep (rejected). This indicates Player 1 values Sheep more than I offered or doesn't need Wheat. The previous successful trade was 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep, which means the player likely values Sheep around 3xWheat.\n    *   Player 1's accepted offers:\n        *   2 Ore -> 5 Wood, 2 Wheat (I accepted). This was a good trade for me. I gave up 2 Ore (80 value) for 5 Wood (55 value) + 2 Wheat (12 value) = 67 value. This was a *loss* of 13 value. Re-evaluating, this was not a good trade. My initial assessment was incorrect. I need to be more careful.\n        *   3 Brick -> 1 Ore (I accepted). I gave up 3 Brick (75 value) for 1 Ore (40 value). This was a *loss* of 35 value. This was a very bad trade for me.\n\n    *   **Crucial Correction:** My previous trade evaluations were flawed. I need to calculate the *net change in my total value* for *each* trade.\n        *   Trade 1 (My offer): 3 Wheat (18) -> 1 Sheep (14). I received 14, gave 18. **Net change: -4**. I lost value.\n        *   Trade 2 (P1 offer): 2 Ore (80) -> 5 Wood (55), 2 Wheat (12). I received 67, gave 80. **Net change: -13**. I lost value.\n        *   Trade 3 (P1 offer): 3 Brick (75) -> 1 Ore (40). I received 40, gave 75. **Net change: -35**. I lost value.\n\n    *   **Overall Learning:** I have consistently lost value in every completed trade so far. My strategy must change immediately. I must **only accept trades that increase my total value** unless there's a highly strategic, long-term reason (which is not apparent currently). I must also make offers that increase my total value.\n\n6.  **Formulate New Offers:**\n    *   Based on Player 1's previous offers and my current resources, I have a clear sense of what they might be willing to trade. They are interested in Ore and Brick from me (they offered Ore to get Wood/Wheat, and Brick to get Ore). They have offered Sheep and Ore to get Brick and Sheep.\n    *   My lowest value resources are Wheat (6) and Wood (11).\n    *   My highest value resources are Ore (40) and Brick (25).\n    *   I have a surplus of Brick. I could trade some Brick for Ore if the ratio is favorable.\n    *   I should try to get more Ore.\n    *   I should avoid giving up high-value resources for low-value returns.\n\nTrading Decision:\nThe incoming offer is: Player 1 offers 3 Sheep (Value: 42) and 2 Ore (Value: 80) for 5 Brick (Value: 125) and 2 Sheep (Value: 28).\nMy value received: 42 (3 Sheep) + 80 (2 Ore) = 122\nMy value given: 125 (5 Brick) + 28 (2 Sheep) = 153\nNet value change for me: 122 - 153 = -31. This is a negative value trade.\n\nBased on my critical re-evaluation of past trades, I absolutely must avoid trades that decrease my total value. This trade decreases my total value significantly. Therefore, I will deny this trade.\nI also need to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me, aiming to gain high-value resources for lower-value or excess resources.\n\nMy current resources:\nWheat: 16 (96)\nWood: 9 (99)\nSheep: 7 (98)\nBrick: 22 (550)\nOre: 7 (280)\n\nI have a lot of Brick. Player 1 seems to want Brick. Player 1 also has Ore. I want more Ore. I also have plenty of Wheat and Wood to offer.\n\nLet's try to get Ore by offering resources that are individually lower value (Wheat, Wood) and potentially some Brick if the ratio is very good.\nPlayer 1 offered 2 Ore for 5 Wood, 2 Wheat. (80 for 55+12=67). They valued 2 Ore more than 67.\nPlayer 1 offered 3 Brick for 1 Ore. (75 for 40). They valued 1 Ore less than 75. This is confusing. It means Brick is more valuable to them than its inherent value *to them*.\n\nI will offer some low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) to get a higher value resource (Ore or Sheep).\nLet's try to trade Wheat and Wood for Ore.\nValue of 1 Ore is 40.\nValue of 1 Wheat = 6. Value of 1 Wood = 11.\nTo get 1 Ore, I'd need to offer 7 Wheat (42) or 4 Wood (44) or a mix.\nLet's try to bundle.\n\nOffer: 4 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore\nValue offered: (4 * 6) + (2 * 11) = 24 + 22 = 46.\nValue requested: 1 * 40 = 40.\nThis offer is bad for me (46 for 40). I need to offer less value or request more value.\n\nLet's rethink based on Player 1's previous offers. They gave 2 Ore (80) for 5 Wood (55) + 2 Wheat (12) = 67. So they value 2 Ore at more than 67.\nThey gave 3 Brick (75) to get 1 Ore (40). This means they were willing to give 75 value to get 40 value. This suggests they *really* want Ore, or they have a very high value for Ore for their own internal production. If they want Ore that badly, I should demand a lot for it. And conversely, if I'm giving up Ore, I should get a lot for it. This previous trade (3 Brick for 1 Ore) was me giving 75 value for 40 value, which was a terrible loss for me.\n\nMy goal: increase total value.\nI will deny the current offer, as it decreases my value.\nThen, I will make an offer that ensures I gain value. Player 1 seems desperate for Ore or values it highly. They also valued Sheep enough to reject 2 Wheat for 1 Sheep, but accepted 3 Wheat for 1 Sheep.\n\nLet's try to capitalize on their apparent desire for Ore, while giving up my lowest value goods.\nI have plenty of Wheat and Wood.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of low-value resources for a single high-value resource?\n\nConsider an offer:\nOffer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore\nMy value given: 8 * 6 = 48\nMy value received: 1 * 40 = 40\nThis is still bad for me. It means I'm offering resources worth more than the resource I'm getting.\n\nI need to reverse this. What if I *request* high-value resources for low-value resources?\nMy goal is to obtain high-value resources (Ore, Brick, Sheep) by giving up low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) or a smaller quantity of high-value resources.\n\nLet's try to trade my low-value resources for Sheep, which is a mid-value resource I don't have a large quantity of.\n1 Sheep = 14\nOffer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep (Player 1 previously accepted this)\nMy value offered: 3 * 6 = 18\nMy value received: 1 * 14 = 14\nNet change: -4. This is a negative value trade. I cannot make this trade if my goal is to increase total value! My previous acceptance of this was also flawed.\n\nThis means Player 1 values Sheep much higher than I do, or they are very good negotiators.\n\nThe only way I increase value is if [value of what I receive] > [value of what I give].\n\nLet's consider trading my Brick, which I have a large quantity of, for Ore.\nI have 22 Brick (value 550). I have 7 Ore (value 280).\nPlayer 1 gave 3 Brick for 1 Ore (my bad trade). This revealed their desperation for Ore.\nValue of 3 Brick = 75. Value of 1 Ore = 40.\nThis means they were willing to give 75 value to get 40 value.\nI could try to make profit from this. I want MORE Ore.\nWhat if I offer a SMALLER amount of Brick for Ore?\nOffer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore\nValue offered: 1 * 25 = 25\nValue received: 1 * 40 = 40\nNet change: +15. This is excellent for me! But Player 1 might instantly deny this because they just gave 3 Brick for 1 Ore.\n\nLet's try something more balanced but still profitable for me.\nThe previous accepted trade (P1 offering) was 3 Brick -> 1 Ore, which implies P1 values their Ore at < 3 Brick.\nI want more Ore. I have 22 Brick.\nWhat if I offer 2 Brick for 1 Ore?\nValue offered: 2 * 25 = 50\nValue received: 1 * 40 = 40\nNet change: -10. Still no good for me.\n\nI need to focus on what I have in surplus and what is high-value for me.\nI have 16 Wheat (low value, high quantity). I have 9 Wood (low value, okay quantity).\nI have 22 Brick (high value, high quantity).\n\nWhat if I offer a mix of low-value and some high-value for Ore?\nPlayer 1 was willing to offer 2 Ore for 5 Wood, 2 Wheat. (80 value for 67 value). They lost value, but perhaps they really needed Wood and Wheat.\nI need to make an offer that nets me positive value.\n\nLet's reverse Player 1's previous profitable move against me.\nThey gave me 2 Ore for 5 Wood, 2 Wheat (I lost 13 value).\nI have 9 Wood, 16 Wheat.\nWhat if I ask for Ore for my Wood/Wheat?\nOffer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 2 Ore\nMy value offered: 5*11 + 2*6 = 55 + 12 = 67\nMy value received: 2*40 = 80\nNet change: +13. This is exactly the reverse of their profitable trade, and my total value would increase. This is something they previously offered, so they might accept getting those resources.\nThis is a good candidate offer.\n\nFinal decision for this turn:\n1. Deny the current incoming offer because it results in a net value loss for me (-31).\n2. Make a new offer that strategically targets Player 1's known resource preferences (they previously gave 2 Ore for 5 Wood, 2 Wheat, indicating they want Wood and Wheat) and results in a positive net value change for me.\n\nAction: [Deny]\nAction: [Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 2 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Understand Current Value:** Calculate the current total value of my resources. This provides a baseline to evaluate potential trades.\n    *   Wheat: 16 * 6 = 96\n    *   Wood: 9 * 11 = 99\n    *   Sheep: 7 * 14 = 98\n    *   Brick: 22 * 25 = 550\n    *   Ore: 7 * 40 = 280\n    *   Total Value: 96 + 99 + 98 + 550 + 280 = 1123\n\n2.  **Identify High-Value Resources (Relative to Trade):** Ore (40) and Brick (25) are my most valuable resources. Sheep (14), Wood (11), and Wheat (6) are less valuable. I should generally aim to trade away lower-value resources for higher-value ones, or to convert surplus low-value resources into needed high-value ones.\n\n3.  **Identify Surplus Resources:** I have 22 Brick, which is a significant quantity. I also have 16 Wheat. Ore, Sheep, and Wood are in smaller quantities. While Brick is high value, having a large surplus means I can potentially trade some away for other high-value resources if the exchange is favorable.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Previous Trades & Player Behavior:**\n    *   My accepted trades:\n        *   3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep (Value: 18 -> 14. Net -4. This was early, likely to get diversity or based on unknown needs. Not a good value trade.)\n        *   2 Ore -> 5 Wood, 2 Wheat (Value: 80 -> 55 + 12 = 67. Net -13. This was not a good trade in terms of pure value, but I accepted it. Perhaps I had too much Ore or needed Wood/Wheat for something specific, or perhaps I miscalculated.)\n        *   3 Brick -> 1 Ore (Value: 75 -> 40. Net -35. This was a *very bad* trade for me. I should not have accepted this. This suggests Player 1 is aggressive and I need to be more careful.)\n    *   My rejected trade: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep (Player 1 rejected *my offer* of 2 Wheat for 1 Sheep. Value 12 -> 14. This was a good trade for me, but Player 1 wanted more.)\n    *   Player 1's rejected trade: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep (Value 3*14 + 2*40 = 42 + 80 = 122 -> 5*25 + 2*14 = 125 + 28 = 153. Net gain of 31 for them. This was a bad trade for me, so rejecting was correct. Player 1 is consistently trying to get a good deal for themselves.)\n\n5.  **Re-evaluate Acceptance Criteria:** My previous acceptances have been detrimental to my total value. I need to be much more stringent. A trade should ideally increase my total value, or at least break even if it provides strategic benefit (e.g., diversifying a critical resource, or getting rid of a huge surplus of a very low-value item). Given the past history, I should only accept trades that clearly benefit me in terms of value.\n\n6.  **Formulate Offer Strategy:**\n    *   Aim to convert low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) into high-value resources (Ore, Brick, Sheep depends on the ratio).\n    *   Consider trading my surplus Brick, but only for a higher *per-unit* value, or in exchange for a significant amount of high-value resources.\n    *   Avoid trading away Ore or Brick unless the return is extremely good.\n    *   Since Player 1 previously rejected my 2 Wheat for 1 Sheep offer (value 12 -> 14), they value Sheep highly or undervalue Wheat.\n    *   Player 1 offered 3 Sheep, 2 Ore for 5 Brick, 2 Sheep. This suggests they want Brick (and maybe to offload some Sheep).\n\n7.  **Calculate Resource Quantities After Last Turn:**\n    *   Initial (before prev turn): Wheat: 16, Wood: 9, Sheep: 7, Brick: 22, Ore: 7\n    *   Player 1 offered: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> Requested: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep (My resources were reduced by this offer's \"requested\" part if accepted, but it was rejected, so no change.)\n    *   The previous turn's operations were:\n        *   Initial: Wheat: 16, Wood: 9, Sheep: 7, Brick: 22, Ore: 7 (Value: 1123)\n        *   Player 1 offered: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore (Player 0 accepted)\n            *   My Brick: 22 - 3 = 19\n            *   My Ore: 7 + 1 = 8\n            *   Current Resources: Wheat: 16, Wood: 9, Sheep: 7, Brick: 19, Ore: 8\n            *   Current Value: 16*6 + 9*11 + 7*14 + 19*25 + 8*40 = 96 + 99 + 98 + 475 + 320 = 1088. (Value *decreased* by 35 due to my acceptance of this bad trade. This confirms my need to be more careful.)\n    *   The *very last offer* was 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep. This was rejected, so my resources are still: Wheat: 16, Wood: 9, Sheep: 7, Brick: 19, Ore: 8.\n\n8.  **Goal:** Increase total value from 1088.\n\nMy Turn:\nI need to make an offer. Based on Player 1's previous offer (3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep), they explicitly asked for Brick and are willing to give Sheep and Ore. This is interesting. While they desired Brick, their proposed exchange was bad for me. I have Brick to spare (19). My Ore is now 8, which is good, and it's high value, so I want to keep it or get something better for it.\n\nI have 16 Wheat (Value 6), which is my lowest value and highest quantity remaining (tied with Brick for highest quantity). I want to shed Wheat.\nI want to gain Ore (Value 40) or Brick (Value 25) or even Sheep (Value 14) if the ratio is good.\n\nLet's try to offload some Wheat for something useful. Player 1 previously rejected 2 Wheat for 1 Sheep.\nHow about a more aggressive offer based on my surplus and desired gain?\n\nMy current resources: Wheat: 16 (6), Wood: 9 (11), Sheep: 7 (14), Brick: 19 (25), Ore: 8 (40).\n\nConsider an offer where I give Wheat for something valuable:\n*   Offer: Some Wheat -> Some Ore\n    *   Example: 5 Wheat (30) -> 1 Ore (40). This is a gain of 10 for me. This is a good deal for me. Player 1 might accept if they need Wheat.\n*   Offer: Some Wheat -> Some Brick\n    *   Example: 3 Wheat (18) -> 1 Brick (25). Gain of 7 for me.\n*   Offer: Some Wood -> Some Ore/Brick (Wood is also relatively low value)\n    *   Example: 2 Wood (22) -> 1 Brick (25). Gain of 3.\n*   Offer: Some Brick (my surplus) -> More Ore.\n    *   Example: 2 Brick (50) -> 2 Ore (80). Gain of 30. This seems good since I have 19 Brick.\n\nGiven Player 1's previous attempts to get Brick, and my surplus, I could try to trade some Brick for Ore at a good rate for me.\nPlayer 1 offered 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep (Value 122 -> 153 for Player 1). They wanted 5 Brick for a net loss of 31 for me. This means they value Brick a lot.\n\nLet's try to reverse that for my benefit. I'll ask for Ore, for Brick.\nWhat if I offer 2 Brick for 1 Ore?\nMy value: 2 Brick * 25 = 50\nRequested value: 1 Ore * 40 = 40\nThis is a loss of 10 for me. Not good.\n\nWhat if I offer Brick for Ore, where *I* gain value?\nGoal: Gain 40 (for 1 Ore).\nTo gain 1 Ore (40), I need to give less than 40 value.\nSay I offer 1 Brick (25) and some Wheat.\n1 Brick, 2 Wheat (25 + 12 = 37) -> 1 Ore (40). Gain of 3. This is a possibility.\nI have a lot of Wheat. Getting rid of it while gaining something good is ideal.\n\nLet's also consider what Player 1 might accept, given they seem to want Brick.\nIf Player 1 wants 5 Brick for 3 Sheep, 2 Ore (153 for them, 122 for me from that side), it means they value Brick more highly than I do.\n\nLet's consider an offer targeting Player 1's apparent desire for Brick, while maximizing my gain.\nTheir last rejected offer was rejected because it was a net negative for me. I need to make a profitable offer.\n\nI will try to offload Wheat for Ore. Player 1 accepted 3 Brick for 1 Ore from me (bad trade for me). This means they are willing to give 1 Ore for something around 75 value. I want to give less than that.\nWheat is My current surplus.\n\nOffer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore\nMy value given: 6 * 6 = 36\nRequested value: 1 * 40 = 40\nThis is a net gain of 4 for me. This is a good trade for me, and Player 1 gets a reasonable amount of Wheat.\n\nLet's evaluate the likelihood of acceptance. Player 1 previously offered 2 Ore for 5 Wood, 2 Wheat (value 80 for them, I paid 67 for my resources). So they are willing to give 2 Ore. My current offer is 1 Ore for 36 value. This means they are getting 1 Ore from me for 36 value, which is probably a bad deal for them if they sell it for 40.\n\nMy offer 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore. My value: 30. Requested: 40. Gain 10.\nPlayer 1's perspective: They gain 1 Ore valued at 40. They give away 5 Wheat valued at 30. This is a gain of 10 for them. Player 1 liked giving away things they had plenty of. This is a good mutual beneficial offer.\n\nFinal decision on the offer:\nI will make an offer that clearly benefits me, uses my lowest value resource (Wheat), and is symmetrical in value gain for both parties, or slightly favors me.\n\nGoing with 5 Wheat for 1 Ore seems like a solid choice.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

Total value: 1123.\n2. **Goal:** Increase total resource value. This means I should aim to trade away lower-valued items for higher-valued items, or trade items I have in abundance for items I lack.\n3. **Past Trades Analysis:**\n    *   **Accepted:**\n        *   Player 0 (Me) offered 3 Wheat (18) for 1 Sheep (14). **Loss of 4.** (Initial blunder, but a small loss for an early accepted trade, perhaps to establish willingness to trade).\n        *   Player 1 offered 2 Ore (80) for 5 Wood (55) and 2 Wheat (12). **My gain: 13 units of value.** (Good trade, I gave up cheaper resources for a highly valued one).\n        *   Player 1 offered 3 Brick (75) for 1 Ore (40). **My gain: 35 units of value.** (Excellent trade, gave up moderately valued resource for a highly valuable one).\n    *   **Rejected by me:**\n        *   Player 1 offered 3 Sheep (42), 2 Ore (80) for 5 Brick (125), 2 Sheep (28). **My perspective**: I would give up 3 Sheep and 2 Ore (122 value) to get 5 Brick and 2 Sheep (153 value). The net would be a gain of 31 value, effectively 1 Sheep and 2 Ore for 5 Brick. Why did I reject this? Perhaps I valued Ore too highly or didn't want to give up that much Ore. Re-evaluating: 3 Sheep + 2 Ore (122) for 5 Brick + 2 Sheep (153). Net: Give 1 Sheep + 2 Ore for 5 Brick. Values: Give 14 + 80 = 94. Get 125. Net gain of 31. This was a good offer for me. I should have accepted it. This highlights a need for quicker value calculations.\n    *   **Rejected by Player 1:**\n        *   Player 0 (Me) offered 2 Wheat (12) for 1 Sheep (14). **My gain of 2.** (Small gain, perhaps not enough for P1 to accept).\n        *   Player 0 (Me) offered 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (40). **My gain of 10.** (Good offer for me, P1 rejected. This implies P1 values Ore highly or thinks 5 Wheat is too little).\n4. **Current Offer from Player 1:** Player 1 offered 3 Brick (75) for 4 Wood (44).\n    *   If Accepted: I give up 4 Wood (44 value) and gain 3 Brick (75 value). Net gain of 31 value.\n    *   This is a good offer for me. I have 9 Wood and 22 Brick. I have plenty of Brick and a moderate amount of Wood. It aligns with the goal of increasing total value.\n5. **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:**\n    *   I have a lot of Wheat (16) and Brick (22). These are good candidates to offer for higher-valued resources.\n    *   I have moderate amounts of Wood (9), Sheep (7), and Ore (7). Ore is my highest value resource, so I should be cautious about trading it away unless the return is very high. Sheep is also relatively high value per unit.\n6. **Player 1's Behavior:** Player 1 seems willing to offer Brick for other resources (offered 3 Brick for 1 Ore, offered 3 Brick for 4 Wood).

They rejected a trade where they would give me Ore (5 Wheat for 1 Ore).\n7. **Negotiation Strategy:**\n    *   Accept profitable offers.\n    *   Make offers that are clearly beneficial to me, but also seem reasonable to Player 1 (e.g., offering lower value items for higher value ones, or items I have in surplus for items I need).\n    *   Be mindful of my high quantity of Wheat and Brick.
