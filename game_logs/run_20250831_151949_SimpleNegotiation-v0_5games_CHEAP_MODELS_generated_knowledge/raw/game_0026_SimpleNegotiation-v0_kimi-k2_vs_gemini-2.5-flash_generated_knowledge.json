Valuation priorities  \n   - Brick (29 \u2192 19.3 each) is worth 2.6 times more than Sheep (12 \u2192 12.0 each) and Wood (12 \u2192 13.2 each). Ore (37 \u2192 18.5 each) is even slightly higher.  \n   - There is a big gap to the lower-value Wheat and Wood/Sheep. A successful trade must move value \u201cup this ladder.\u201d\n\n2. Surplus & deficit analysis  \n   - Sheep and Wood are abundant (above their historical gathering ratios).  \n   - Ore is scarce and high-value; Brick is about average quantity but super-high value.  \n   - Therefore **giving up Sheep/Wood in exchange for Ore/Brick is the fastest way to boost total value**.\n\n3. Trade-making tactics (turn 1)  \n   - Opening offers should appear small and balanced so other players do not immediately realize the steep value gain.  \n   - It is normally worth slightly overpaying in quantity-of-low-value-goods to secure high-value goods (a classic \u201cbulk low-value for scarce high-value\u201d move).  \n   - Offers should not fully wipe out a resource you may need for later turns (keep a minimum stock of everything).\n\nApplying the generated knowledge:\n\nI\u2019m going to try to upgrade 3 of my abundant Sheep (3\u00d712 = 36 value) into 1 more Brick (29 value) plus a small extra.

Every transaction should be evaluated based on whether the value of resources received exceeds the value of resources given up.\n2.  **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:** I have a significant quantity of Sheep (22) and Wheat (11), which are relatively low-value resources. I have fewer high-value resources like Ore and Brick. This suggests I should prioritize trading away low-value, high-quantity resources for higher-value, lower-quantity ones.\n3.  **Understanding Opponent's Needs (Inferred):** Player 0 has consistently offered Sheep. This suggests they might value Sheep less or have an excess, or they need the resources they request (Brick, Ore) more. Their latest offer includes Ore, implying they might have an excess of Ore or are willing to trade it for other high-value resources if the exchange is beneficial.\n4.  **Strategic Bidding/Offering:** My previous strategy was to reject offers that didn't meet my value criteria or to accept clearly beneficial ones. Now, I need to proactively make an offer.\n5.  **Calculate Offer Value:** For the incoming offer:\n    *   Offered: 3 Sheep (3 * 12 = 36) + 2 Ore (2 * 36 = 72) = Total Value Offered: 108\n    *   Requested: 5 Brick (5 * 22 = 110) + 2 Sheep (2 * 12 = 24) = Total Value Requested: 134\n    *   This offer results in a net loss of 108 - 134 = -26 value for me. This is not good.\n\nGiven the current offer, I should deny it as it reduces my total value. My subsequent action should be to make a new offer that increases my total value.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge\n\n1. Scarcity & Surplus \u2013 you have only 5 Ore (top value) and 11 Brick (next highest).  Sheep and Wood are in massive surplus (24 & 22).  Efficient strategy is to off-load surplus for the scarce/high-value resources (Brick/Ore).\n\n2. Incremental vs. \u201ckilo\u201d trading \u2013 Player 1 has already accepted 3 Sheep \u2194 2 Brick twice, proving an established \u201cmarket price.\u201d  Abruptly asking for extra Ore alongside 5 bricks (a package four turns later) changed the value density too sharply and was denied.  Keep the same ratio, upgrade size gradually.\n\n3. Rationality check \u2013 3 Sheep at 12 value for 24 total = 0.5 value per Sheep.  Brick is 29 total for 11 units \u2248 2.64 value per Brick.  Two bricks therefore equal 5.28 value; three Sheep equal 1.5 value.  Even at the simple barter level, you are giving away more total value per unit than you are receiving.  Although you have surplus, at current rate you would be over-paying.\n\n4. Balance the trade packet \u2013 re-shape so any single deal\u2019s per-unit value sits closer to 1-to-1 after accounting for your surplus.  Two bundles are attractive:  \n   a) 4 Sheep (value 2.0) for 3 Brick (value 7.9) keeps an accepted size while improving the ratio to ~2-to-1.  \n   b) Alternatively, 5 Sheep + 2 Wood (combined 7.5 value) for 4 Brick (10.56 value), producing slight gain.\n\n5. Never reveal full need \u2013 your Ore offer was rejected likely because it signaled \u201cextract extra,\u201d i.e., desperation.  Moderation retains goodwill and raises acceptance probability.\n\n6. Explicit repetition encouragement \u2013 phrasing or bundle size that has already been proven acceptable once is less cognitively risky for the opponent; exploit familiarity.\n\nApply Knowledge & Decision\n\nKeep using Sheep surplus, slightly improve Brick per-unit exchange rate, and package size the opponent already tolerated; avoid combining low-value Sheep with high-value Ore again for now.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 3 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1.  **Value-based Trading:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade must result in a net gain in value. I need to calculate the value of items offered versus items requested to ensure profitability.\n2.  **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:** I have a significant quantity of Sheep (22) and Brick (16). Wood (9) and Wheat (11) are relatively lower, and Ore (13) is valuable. I should be more willing to trade abundant, lower-value resources for scarce, higher-value ones.\n3.  **Understanding Opponent's Offers:** Player 0 has consistently offered Sheep. This suggests they either have a surplus of Sheep or a high demand for what they are requesting (Brick, Ore). Their current offer of 4 Sheep for 3 Brick continues this pattern.\n4.  **Strategic Counter-Offers (Implicit):** While I can't explicitly counter-offer in this format, my decision to accept/deny sends a signal. If I repeatedly deny unfavorable offers, Player 0 might improve their terms.\n5.  **Market Dynamics (Implicit):** Past trades show Player 0 values Brick (requested it multiple times) and Ore. I have a good amount of Brick. This gives me leverage.\n6.  **Incremental Gains:** Even small value gains are good. Multiple small profitable trades can add up.\n7.  **Evaluating Current Offer:**\n    *   Player 0 offers: 4 Sheep. Value of 4 Sheep = 4 * 12 = 48.\n    *   Player 0 requests: 3 Brick. Value of 3 Brick = 3 * 22 = 66.\n    *   Net change for me: +48 (from sheep received) - 66 (from brick given) = -18. This is a loss.\n8.  **Negotiation History:** I accepted earlier offers of \"3 Sheep -> 2 Brick\". Let's re-evaluate those for consistency:\n    *   3 Sheep value = 3 * 12 = 36\n    *   2 Brick value = 2 * 22 = 44\n    *   Net change for me: +36 (sheep received) - 44 (brick given) = -8.\n    *   Uh oh. I made two losing trades previously. This is a critical realization. My past acceptances were *not* profitable. I was giving away more value than I received. This indicates I need to be much more stringent in my calculations.\n    *   The game state reflects this: \"Player 1 accepted the trade offer from Player 0.\" My past acceptance was a mistake given my objective of *increasing* total value.\n\n**Applying Knowledge and Decision:**\n\nBased on the re-evaluation of past trades and the principle of increasing total value, the current offer from Player 0 is *not* beneficial to me. I would lose 18 value (66 value given for 48 value received). I should not accept this under any circumstances if my goal is to increase my total value.\n\n[Deny]",
