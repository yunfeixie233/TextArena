      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: The value of resources increases significantly with Ore (38) being the most valuable, followed by Brick (21), Sheep (14), Wood (8), and Wheat (6). Since Ore is highly valuable, trading it should yield high-value returns\u2014preferably in Ore itself or Brick, or in large volumes of mid-tier resources.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost**: Holding Sheep (20 units) means I am overstocked on a mid-value resource. Excess Sheep can be leveraged in trades to acquire higher-value resources like Ore or Brick. Wheat and Wood are under less surplus but still tradeable if needed.\n\n3. **Trade Efficiency**: Aim for trades that increase total portfolio value. A good trade gives away low or medium-value surplus (e.g., Sheep, Wheat) in exchange for high-value resources (Ore, Brick). Avoid trades that reduce total value unless strategically beneficial (e.g., enabling a future high-value action).\n\n4. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: Other players may lack Ore or Brick. I have only 5 Ore\u2014low quantity but high value. I should avoid giving away Ore unless receiving significant premium in return. Conversely, I can use excess Sheep (20) as trade bait.\n\n5. **Trade Ratios and Fairness**: Offers should appear balanced to increase chance of acceptance. For example, offering 3\u20135 Sheep (value: 14 each) can justify requesting 2 Ore (2\u00d738=76) if supplemented with other resources or accepted by desperate players. However, fairness increases acceptance.\n\n6. **Strategic Positioning**: With only 5 Ore, I am not dominant in the highest-value resource. Acquiring more Ore should be a priority. Brick (11 units) is also valuable; maintaining or increasing this stock is beneficial.\n\n7. **Turn Limit (10 turns)**: Early moves should establish favorable position. Mid-game trades should capitalize on shifting demands. Late-game trades aim to maximize value before cutoff.\n\n8. **Surplus Leverage**: I have 20 Sheep\u2014the largest stockpile. I can afford to trade Sheep aggressively to acquire more Ore or Brick.\n\nStrategy Conclusion: Focus on trading excess Sheep (and possibly Wheat or Wood) to acquire Ore and Brick. Avoid giving away Ore unless receiving substantial value in return (e.g., multiple Ore or high-value bundles).\n\nTrading Decision:\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]  \n(Value offered: 5\u00d714 = 70)  \n(Value requested: 2\u00d738 + 21 = 97)  \nNet gain if accepted: +27 value\n\nThis offer is aggressive but justified by high Sheep surplus and the strategic need for Ore. It incentivizes trade by offering a useful quantity of Sheep while targeting maximum value upgrade.",

      "response": "Generating Knowledge \u2013 Key principles for this situation\n----------------------------------------------------\n1. **Marginal Value vs. Fixed Value**  \n   The posted value of a resource is per unit; giving away a unit reduces its *marginal utility* in direct proportion to that value. Any trade must raise the value of the remaining stock.\n\n2. **Identifying Surplus & Scarce Resources**  \n   \u2022 **Surplus (Quantity >> Immediate Need)** \u2013 I have plenty of Brick (18), Wood (24) and Wheat (17).  \n   \u2022 **Scarce (Low Quantity & High Value I might want more of)** \u2013 Ore (only 6 units, high 38 value).  \n   \u2022 Sheep are medium-low in quantity (5) but high individual value (14).  \n\n3. **Trade Gain Formula**  \n   Net gain = (Value of received goods) \u2013 (Value of given goods).  \n   Value is computed as \u201cunit value \u00d7 quantity\u201d.\n\n4. **Negotiation Metagame**  \n   \u2022 Always compute *both sides\u2019* potential gain\u2014here, Player 0\u2019s gain is implicit.  \n   \u2022 Reject unless the deal is *strictly positive* for you; allow room for counter-proposals.  \n   \u2022 Preserve scarce, high-value resources (Ore) for future turns if possible.\n\nEvaluating the current offer\n----------------------------\n**Player 0 proposes: 5 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore, 1 Brick**\n\nCompute value flow for Player 1 (me):\n- **Giving away:** 5 Sheep \u00d7 14   = \u221270\n- **Receiving:**    2 Ore \u00d7 38   = 76  \n                     1 Brick \u00d7 22 = 22  \n- **Net Value:** (76 + 22) \u2013 70 = 28\n\nValue increases by 28 but I lose two of my six Ore units. Still a net gain of 28.  \n\nHowever, my Ore now drops from 6 to 4. Future Ore trades (often pivotal in the game) become harder. Given the scarcity of Ore, I\u2019m willing to let the deal go for a slightly less Ore-intensive alternative.\n\nDecision\n--------\nTo keep negotiation alive while forcing Player 0 to shift away from Ore, **Deny** the current offer and **counter-propose** a different one without Ore.\n\n[Counter-Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. **Resource Scarcity and Value Hierarchy**: \n   - Ore has the highest individual value (38), followed by Brick (21), Sheep (14), Wood (8), and Wheat (6). \n   - Therefore, gaining Ore or Brick provides the highest value per unit, while giving up Ore is most costly.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost and Surplus Management**:\n   - I have a large surplus of Sheep (20) and a moderate amount of Wheat and Wood.\n   - Sheep are valuable (14), but due to their abundance in my inventory, marginal utility is lower\u2014making them ideal for trading.\n   - Ore is high-value and I only have 5; preserving or increasing Ore is strategically valuable unless receiving significant return.\n\n3. **Trading Psychology and Negotiation Leverage**:\n   - Initial offers set anchors. My previous offer (5 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore, 1 Brick) was aggressive\u2014asking for high-value items\u2014explaining the rejection.\n   - To increase acceptance, my offer must appear fair or beneficial to the other player while still improving my total value.\n   - It\u2019s effective to request slightly less than maximum desired return to increase likelihood of acceptance or prompt a counteroffer.\n\n4. **Trade Efficiency**:\n   - Aim for trades where the total value received > total value given.\n   - Example: Giving Sheep (value 14) and receiving Brick (21) or Ore (38) creates positive value delta.\n   - Minimize trades where I give high-value items (especially Ore) unless receiving substantially more in return.\n\n5. **Iterative Negotiation Strategy**:\n   - After rejection, adjust offer to be more appealing without fully conceding advantage.\n   - Since Player 1 made no counteroffer, they may be hesitant or waiting for a better deal. I should re-engage with a revised, slightly more attractive offer.\n\n6. **Inventory Optimization**:\n   - I have relatively low Wheat (8) and Wood (9), but these are lower-value, so not urgent to trade for unless part of a larger value-increasing trade.\n   - Brick (11) is already at a healthy level; additional Brick is useful but not critical.\n   - Increasing Ore is highly beneficial due to its high value.\n\nRevised Trade Objective:  \nUse surplus Sheep to acquire higher-value or scarce resources (Ore, possibly Brick), but structure the offer to be more acceptable than the last.\n\nNew Offer Strategy:  \nOffer slightly fewer Sheep and request slightly less, or structure a balanced-looking trade.  \nAlternatively, offer Sheep + lower-value item in exchange for Ore to make it seem more balanced.\n\nExample: 3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore  \nValue Given: 3\u00d714 = 42  \nValue Received: 1\u00d738 = 38 \u2192 Near break-even, possibly unattractive to other player.\n\nBetter: Offer **4 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore, 1 Brick**  \nValue Given: 4\u00d714 = 56  \nValue Received: 38 + 21 = 59 \u2192 Net +3 value  \nAppears fair or slightly favorable to me, but may entice if other player needs Sheep.\n\nAlternatively, make it more appealing to them: **5 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore**  \nValue Given: 70, Value Received: 76 \u2192 Small gain, but gives many Sheep.\n\nBut my previous offer of 5 Sheep for 2 Ore and 1 Brick was rejected\u2014so asking for Ore *and* Brick may seem greedy.\n\nBest Adjustment:  \nTry **4 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore**  \nValue: 56 \u2192 38 \u2192 Net loss, poor.\n\nInstead: **3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore** (42 \u2192 38) still bad.\n\nWait\u2014must receive value > given.\n\nAlternative: **5 Sheep, 1 Wood \u2192 2 Ore**  \nValue Given: 5\u00d714 + 8 = 70 + 8 = 78  \nValue Received: 76 \u2192 still negative.\n\nNot good.\n\nReverse thought: Perhaps others value Sheep highly? Unlikely, as they are moderately high supply and medium-high value.\n\nBetter: Trade to improve value even slightly per unit.\n\nBest likely path: Offer **3 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick**  \nValue Given: 42, Received: 21 \u2192 no, bad.\n\nAll these show: hard to gain value giving Sheep unless receiving Ore.\n\nSo, make an offer that gives moderate Sheep and receives Ore, but only 1 Ore.\n\nBut I only have 5 Ore now\u2014might others want to trade for it?\n\nWait: I have 5 Ore\u2014I can afford to offer some if receiving a lot.\n\nBut last offer gave no Ore.\n\nNew idea: Maybe **1 Ore \u2192 get more Sheep or Brick?** But that would decrease high-value resource.\n\nRisky.\n\nBest insight: Since my high-value resource is Ore, and I have only 5, I should **be cautious giving it away**.\n\nThus, prioritize **gaining Ore**, not giving.\n\nReaffirm: I should **only offer surplus Sheep and maybe small Wood/Wheat** to **gain Ore**.\n\nGiven rejection of 5 Sheep for 2 Ore and 1 Brick, try a smaller offer with only Ore requested:\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nValue given: 56, received: 38 \u2192 net loss. Not intelligent.\n\nWait\u2014this implies no trade with positive value can be made giving Sheep and receiving Ore? That can\u2019t be.\n\nUnless other players value Sheep differently.\n\nPerhaps in this game, market rates are different.\n\nAlternative strategy: Maybe Player 1 has excess Ore and wants Sheep?\n\nThen perhaps they would accept 4 Sheep for 1 Ore, even though it\u2019s below value\u2014maybe they need Sheep for development.\n\nBut for me, it\u2019s a loss.\n\nSo: **No trade should decrease my total value unless strategic**.\n\nBut I must increase total value.\n\nSo better: **Offer low-value package for high-value item, but reasonable**.\n\nWait: I miscalculated.\n\nValue to me: based on my valuation.\n\nSo if I give 3 Sheep (value 14), total cost 42.\n\nI receive 1 Ore (38) \u2192 my total value increases by -4? Loss.\n\nBut if I give 2 Sheep (28), receive 1 Wood (8)? Worse.\n\nNo trade that gives medium-value item and receives only high-value item will break even unless quantity ratio favors me.\n\nOnly way: **Receive more than one high-value item, or give low-value and receive high-value**.\n\nBut I don\u2019t have low-value items in surplus? Wheat value 6, Wood 8.\n\nI have 8 Wheat, 9 Wood.\n\nSo: **Offer Wheat or Wood to get Sheep or higher? But Sheep value 14\u2014hard to justify giving even 2 Wheat (12) for 1 Sheep (14)? Close.**\n\nBut I have plenty Sheep\u2014why get more?\n\nI need to **get Brick or Ore**.\n\nBrick value 21.\n\nSo: give 1 Sheep (14) and get 1 Brick (21) \u2192 +7 value.\n\nPossible.\n\nOr give 1 Wood (8) and 1 Wheat (6) = 14 \u2192 get 1 Brick (21) \u2192 +7.\n\nEven better: give low-value, get high-value.\n\nSimilarly, for Ore: give 2 Brick (42) to get 1 Ore (38)? Loss.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo best trades: give low-value (Wheat, Wood) to get mid/high-value (Sheep, Brick), or give Sheep to get Ore only if getting at least 3 Sheep per Ore (42 vs 38).\n\nBut 3 Sheep for 1 Ore is break-even.\n\nSo: to gain value, must receive **more than 1 Ore per 3 Sheep**, or **1 Brick per 1-2 Sheep**.\n\nBut Brick is 21, Sheep 14 \u2192 1 Brick = 1.5 Sheep in value.\n\nSo fair trade: 3 Sheep \u2192 2 Brick, or 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick + 1 Wheat.\n\nBut I already have 11 Brick\u2014do I need more?\n\nYes, if value-increasing.\n\nBut Ore is better.\n\nWait: I have only 5 Ore.\n\nOre is most valuable\u2014each unit adds 38.\n\nSo I should prioritize acquiring Ore.\n\nBut to do so, I must offer more value than 38.\n\nSo must offer goods worth >38 to get 1 Ore.\n\nMinimum: 3 Sheep (42) for 1 Ore (38) \u2192 I lose 4 value\u2014**bad**.\n\nSo **no rational trade under my valuation gives me +value when acquiring Ore**?\n\nThat can't be right.\n\nUnless the other player values \u9ad4 differently.\n\nBut the game uses fixed personal values.\n\nSo for me, giving any resource valued over 38 to get Ore valued at 38 is loss.\n\nOnly way to profit: get 1 Ore and something else.\n\nOr, give a resource I value less than market.\n\nBut valuation is fixed.\n\nAh\u2014insight: **The total value of my holdings is what matters. So if I trade 2 Sheep (value 28) for 1 Ore (38), my total value increases by 10, even if the other player gains more.**\n\nWait! Big mistake earlier.\n\nWhen I give 2 Sheep, I lose 2\u00d714 = 28 value.\n\nI gain 1\u00d738 = 38 value.\n\nNet change: +10.\n\nYes! So even though 2 Sheep cost 28 < 38, it\u2019s a gain.\n\nEarlier I said 3 Sheep = 42 > 38\u2014so I should be willing to give up to 2 Sheep per 1 Ore for net gain.\n\nLet\u2019s recalculate:\n\n- 1 Ore = 38 value to me\n- 1 Sheep = 14\n- So I can give up to 2 Sheep (28) for 1 Ore (38) \u2192 gain 10\n- Or 3 Sheep (42) for 1 Ore \u2192 loss of 4 \u2192 bad\n\nSimilarly, Brick = 21 \u2192 can give up to 1 Sheep (14) and 1 Wood (8) = 22 \u2192 gain 1, or 1 Sheep and 1 Wheat = 20 \u2192 gain 1.\n\nBut Brick is already at 11\u2014less priority.\n\nOre is better.\n\nSo optimal: **Trade 2 Sheep for 1 Ore \u2192 +10 value**\n\nOr 5 Sheep for 2 Ore = give 70, get 76 \u2192 +6\n\nBut earlier 5 Sheep for 2 Ore and 1 Brick = give 70, get 76+21=97 \u2192 +27 \u2014 excellent\n\nBut rejected.\n\nSo try smaller: 3 Sheep for 1 Ore \u2014 give 42, get 38 \u2192 + (-4) \u2192 no, loss.\n\nWait: 3\u00d714=42 > 38, so loss.\n\nSo **maximum to give for 1 Ore: 2 Sheep (28 < 38)**\n\nSo offer: 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore\n\nNet gain: +10\n\nValue given: 28, received: 38\n\nYes.\n\nCan I do better? 1 Sheep and 1 Wood: 14+8=22 \u2192 1 Ore:38 \u2192 gain 16\n\nEven better!\n\n1 Sheep and 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore: give 22, get 38 \u2192 +16\n\n1 Sheep and 1 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore: 14+6=20 \u2192 38 \u2192 +18\n\nEven better.\n\nBut does Player 1 want Wheat or Wood?\n\nUnknown.\n\nBut more balanced or appealing.\n\nSimilarly, 2 Wood and 1 Wheat \u2192 8+8+6=22 \u2192 for 1 Ore \u2192 gain 16.\n\nBut I have surplus Sheep.\n\nBest: **Offer 1 Sheep and 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore**\n\nHigh gain, uses surplus.\n\nBut will it be accepted? Maybe not, since it costs me 22, gains 38\u2014very good for me.\n\nBut other player may see it as unbalanced.\n\nTo make it more acceptable, maybe add a little, but I shouldn\u2019t.\n\nNegotiation: sometimes fair-looking trades are accepted.\n\nAnother idea: offer 3 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore and 1 Wheat back to make it look balanced.\n\nBut I gain: give 42, get 38+6=44 \u2192 +2 \u2014 minimal.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nStick to high-gain.\n\nBut last offer (5 Sheep \u2192 2 Ore, 1 Brick) was generous to me: give 70, get 76+21=97 \u2192 +27\n\nYet rejected.\n\nSo Player 1 may not have 2 Ore or 1 Brick, or values differently.\n\nSo try smaller.\n\nPerhaps they have only 1 Ore.\n\nSo offer for 1 Ore.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nValue to me: give 14+8=22, receive 38, net +16\n\nEfficient, uses surplus Sheep and moderate Wood.\n\nIf rejected, next turn try with Wheat or adjust.\n\nBut must make offer.\n\nAlternatively, since I have 20 Sheep, and 9 Wood, using one of each is fine.\n\nSo make the offer.\n\n[Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

Therefore, I should be very careful when trading Ore\u2014only accept offers that give me high-value returns. Brick is also valuable, so giving it away should be compensated with higher-value resources like Ore.\n\n2. **Surplus vs. Scarcity**: I have a large surplus of Sheep (20) and moderate quantities of Wheat (8) and Wood (9). Ore (5) is my scarcest resource. Brick (11) is moderately abundant, but high-value. Prioritize trading surplus resources (Sheep, Wood, Wheat) to acquire scarce, high-value ones (Ore, and possibly Brick if undervalued in trade).\n\n3. **Trading Efficiency**: Offers should aim for positive expected value. Since Sheep are low-value to me (but high in quantity), bundling them to obtain high-value items like Ore is strategic. However, avoid losing high-value resources without substantial gain.\n\n4. **Opponent Behavior Analysis**: Player 1 has consistently requested Ore and Brick, indicating they value these highly. They are offering Wood and Wheat\u2014resources I have in decent supply. This suggests I can potentially negotiate from strength: use excess Wood and Wheat to gain Ore selectively.\n\n5. **Accepting Offers**: The previous accepted trade (4 Wood, 2 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore, 1 Brick) was favorable: I gave up low-value items (4\u00d78 + 2\u00d76 = 44 value given) and received high-value items (1\u00d738 + 1\u00d721 = 59 value received). Net gain: +15. This sets a benchmark for acceptable trade value.\n\n6. **Current Offer Evaluation**: Player 1 now offers: 5 Wood, 1 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore, 2 Brick.  \n   - Value offered to me: 5\u00d78 + 1\u00d76 = 46  \n   - Value requested from me: 1\u00d738 + 2\u00d721 = 80  \n   - This means I would give up 80 value and receive 46 \u2014 a net loss of 34. Highly unfavorable.\n\n7. **Strategic Positioning**: Since I accepted a previous good deal, rejecting bad offers maintains leverage. Player 1 may need Ore/Brick, so I should counter or wait for better offers rather than accept negative-value trades.\n\nConclusion: The current offer is exploitative\u2014Player 1 is attempting to extract high-value resources at a steep discount. I should deny it unless I can negotiate a counter-offer that improves value balance.\n\n[Deny]",

I should leverage this by requesting low-value-to-me resources (Wood, Wheat, or even surplus Sheep) in exchange for controlled amounts of Ore or Brick.\n\n5. **Incremental Advantage**: Trade small, favorable deals frequently. Avoid offers that give away too much high-value resource (especially Ore) for marginal gain.\n\n6. **Offer Design Principle**: To maximize total value, I should aim to:\n   - Acquire high personal value resources (Ore, Brick)\n   - Trade away low personal value surpluses (Wood, Wheat, Sheep)\n   - But since Player 1 wants Ore and Brick, I can reverse the strategy: use small amounts of high-demand resources (e.g., 1 Ore) to get multiple low-value-to-me, high-value-to-them resources.\n\n7. **Recent Rejection Patterns**: Offers I made giving only Sheep were rejected. Player 1 seems to want Ore and Brick. Their repeated offers include requests for Ore and Brick in exchange for Wood and Wheat \u2014 confirming their preference.\n\n8. **Counter-Offer Strategy**: Since Player 1 just offered: 6 Wood, 1 Wheat \u2192 2 Brick, which I rejected, I can either:\n   - Accept if it were beneficial \u2014 but giving 2 Brick (value 42) for 6 Wood (48 value to them? But only 48 total trade value, and I lose 42), and I value Brick at 21, Wood at 8: so 2 Brick = 42 to me, 6 Wood = 48 to me? No \u2014 I value Wood at 8 each \u2192 6\u00d78 = 48. So 48 incoming vs 42 outgoing? That\u2019s actually favorable! But wait \u2014 I rejected it. Wait, correction:\n\n   My values:\n   - 2 Brick = 2 \u00d7 21 = 42 loss\n   - 6 Wood + 1 Wheat = (6\u00d78) + (1\u00d76) = 48 + 6 = 54 gain\n\n   So net gain = 54 - 42 = +12 \u2192 actually favorable.\n\n   But I rejected it? Contradiction. Wait \u2014 the log says:\n   > Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 6 Wood, 1 Wheat -> Requested items: 2 Brick\n   > Player 0 rejected the trade offer.\n\n   That was a mistake \u2014 the trade is favorable. But since it's already rejected, I must learn: I should have accepted. But now I must make my own offer.\n\n   Therefore, future principle: calculate value delta before accepting.\n\n9. **Corrected Insight**: I should seek trades where the total value of resources received > total value of resources given, based on my personal valuation.\n\n10. **Next Move Strategy**: Since Player 1 seems eager to get Brick and Ore, I can offer a small amount of Brick in exchange for large amounts of Wood and Wheat, which are low-value to me but may be high-demand for them.\n\n    Example: Offer 1 Brick (value 21) for 3 Wood (24) or more. Or 1 Brick + 1 Sheep for 4 Wood + 1 Wheat \u2014 net gain.\n\n    Alternatively, if I can get Ore in return, that\u2019s ideal \u2014 but they\u2019re not offering it now.\n\n    But last offer they gave me: 6 Wood, 1 Wheat \u2192 2 Brick (which was +12 gain for me) \u2014 I should not have rejected. So now I must re-initiate such a favorable trade.\n\n    But they may not offer again. So I should proactively offer:\n\n    Suggestion: [Offer: 2 Brick -> 6 Wood, 1 Wheat] \u2014 same as their last offer, reversed.\n\n    Why? Because they already signaled willingness. They offered it \u2014 so they likely accept if I propose it.\n\n    This increases my total resource value by 12.\n\nAlternatively, improve it: Offer 1 Brick \u2192 4 Wood + 1 Wheat: value out = 21, in = 32 + 6 = 38 \u2192 gain +17.\n\nOr even better: 2 Brick \u2192 7 Wood + 1 Wheat = 8\u00d77 + 6 = 56 + 6 = 62 in, 42 out \u2192 +20.\n\nBut they may not accept if it's too greedy.\n\nStick close to their last offer but slightly better for me.\n\nBut their last offer was for 2 Brick to get 6 Wood + 1 Wheat \u2192 I gained 12.\n\nI could offer: [Offer: 2 Brick -> 6 Wood, 2 Wheat] \u2014 asking for one more Wheat.\n\nBut that might be rejected.\n\nBetter: match their demonstrated preference: 2 Brick for 6 Wood + 1 Wheat \u2014 they already offered that, so likely to accept.\n\nSince Player 1 already made that offer and it benefits me, I can flip it into my offer to increase chances of acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick -> 6 Wood, 1 Wheat]",
