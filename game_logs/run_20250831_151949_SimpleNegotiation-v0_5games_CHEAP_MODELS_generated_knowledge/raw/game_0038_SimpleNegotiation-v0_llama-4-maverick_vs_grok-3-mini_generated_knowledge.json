Currently, Ore is the most valuable, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n4. **Negotiation Tactics**: Be prepared to make offers that are favorable to me but also reasonable for potential trading partners.\n5. **Assess Offers**: When receiving offers, evaluate them based on whether they increase my total resource value.\n\n### Initial Analysis:\nGiven my current resources, I have a good quantity of Sheep and a significant amount of Ore, both of which are valuable. However, I have relatively fewer units of Wood and Brick compared to their potential value.\n\n### Potential Trades:\nTo increase my total value, I should look to trade resources that are less valuable for those that are more valuable. \n\n1. **Trade Wheat for More Valuable Resources**: With a value of 6, Wheat is the least valuable resource. Trading it for resources like Brick or Ore could be beneficial.\n2. **Optimize Quantity and Value**: Consider trading some Sheep (Value = 15) for resources that might be undervalued or needed in larger quantities.\n\n### Example Trade:\nOne potential trade could involve offering Wheat (low value) in exchange for a more valuable resource.

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\nBefore making my trading decision, I'll outline key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are relevant to my current situation. This is based on evaluating my resources, the incoming offer, and general negotiation best practices.\n\n1. **Value Assessment and Net Gain**: The core principle is to prioritize trades that increase the total value of my resources. I must calculate the net value change for any trade by comparing the value of what I'm giving versus what I'm receiving. In my case, values are assigned to resources (e.g., Wheat total value: 6 for 6 qty, implying ~1 per unit), so I should ensure the incoming resources' value exceeds the outgoing ones. This prevents unfavorable trades and aligns with my goal of maximizing total value.\n\n2. **Resource Scarcity and Abundance**: I have abundant resources like Wood (20 qty, low total value: 9) and Ore (18 qty, high total value: 33), which might make them good for trading away if I can get higher-value items in return. Conversely, I should be cautious with scarcer or higher-value resources like Brick (7 qty, total value: 28). The incoming offer involves Wheat (which has low value to me) and Brick (relatively high value), so I need to assess if trading Brick away is worth the gain, especially since I'm not specified as needing Wheat urgently.\n\n3. **Negotiation Tactics and Fairness**: In a multi-turn game (10 turns total), I should avoid accepting unbalanced offers unless they clearly benefit me, as this could signal weakness and reduce future leverage. Strategies include:\n   - **Accept only if it provides a clear net gain**: Reject or counteroffer if the trade doesn't improve my position.\n   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: With 10 turns, I can afford to deny poor offers and wait for better ones, but I shouldn't pass up immediate value increases.\n   - **Risk of Opportunity Cost**: Denying an offer might mean missing out on resources, so evaluate if I can use the offered items elsewhere or if holding out is viable.\n   - **Psychological Factors**: Accepting a fair offer might encourage future trades from other players, fostering goodwill.\n\n4. **Specific Insights for This Offer**: Player 0 is offering 10 Wheat (based on my valuation, Wheat is worth ~1 per unit, so 10 Wheat = ~10 total value) in exchange for 1 Brick (from my 7 Brick with total value: 28, so ~4 per unit). This could be a good deal if the net value is positive, but I must consider if Wheat aligns with my needs. Overall, focus on quantitative analysis to ensure the trade aligns with my objective.\n\nIn summary, the most relevant strategy is to perform a quick value calculation for net gain, while considering the game's limited turns and my resource abundance.\n\n### Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge, I'll evaluate Player 0's offer: They are offering 10 Wheat (estimated value to me: 10, based on my Wheat's per-unit value of ~1) in exchange for 1 Brick (value to me: ~4, as my 7 Brick total 28 value).\n\n- Current total value of my resources: 6 (Wheat) + 9 (Wood) + 18 (Sheep) + 28 (Brick) + 33 (Ore) = 94.\n- If I accept: I lose 1 Brick (reducing Brick value from 28 to ~24 for 6 qty) and gain 10 Wheat (increasing Wheat value from 6 to ~16 for 16 qty total).\n- New total value: (94 - 4) + 10 = 100.\n\nThis results in a net gain of 6 value, which directly increases my total resources' value. Therefore, this trade aligns with my goal, and I see no immediate reason to deny or counteroffer given the positive outcome.\n\n[Accept]",

      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the current situation and resources.\nThe player currently has: 21 Wheat (Value: 6), 6 Wood (Value: 11), 15 Sheep (Value: 15), 9 Brick (Value: 24), and 9 Ore (Value: 36). The total value of resources is (21*6) + (6*11) + (15*15) + (9*24) + (9*36) = 126 + 66 + 225 + 216 + 324 = 957.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the recent trade and its impact.\nThe player made an offer of 10 Wheat for 1 Brick to Player 1, which was accepted. This means the player now has 11 Wheat, 10 Sheep, 10 Brick, and the same amount of other resources. The new total value is (11*6) + (6*11) + (15*15) + (10*24) + (9*36) = 66 + 66 + 225 + 240 + 324 = 921. The trade resulted in a loss of value (957 - 921 = 36).\n\n## Step 3: Generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation.\nTo improve the total value of resources, the player should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. The current values are: Wheat (6), Wood (11), Sheep (15), Brick (24), and Ore (36). The player should look to trade resources with values less than the resources they are requesting.\n\n## Step 4: Assess current resources and potential trades.\nThe player has 11 Wheat, 6 Wood, 15 Sheep, 10 Brick, and 9 Ore. To increase total value, the player could consider trading Wheat (6) or Wood (11) for higher-value resources like Sheep (15), Brick (24), or Ore (36), or trading Sheep (15) for Brick (24) or Ore (36).\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate potential trades based on the current situation.\nSince the last trade was not beneficial, the player needs to make a more valuable trade. One potential trade could involve offering Wheat or Wood for a higher-value resource. Another option is to look at what the player has in abundance and what they can offer.\n\n## Step 6: Formulate a trading decision based on the generated knowledge.\nGiven the current resources and their values, one potential trade is to offer Wheat (lower value) for Ore (higher value) or other higher-value resources. For example, offering Wheat for Ore: [Offer: X Wheat -> Y Ore] where X*6 < Y*36. A simple trade could be 6 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n\n## Step 7: Execute the trading decision.\nLet's consider offering 6 Wheat for 1 Ore: [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]. This trade increases the total value by (1*36) - (6*6) = 36 - 36 = 0. It's not beneficial but doesn't lose value either. A more beneficial trade would be needed.\n\n## Step 8: Re-evaluate resources and consider alternative trades.\nThe player has 11 Wheat and could offer some for a more valuable resource. Another option is to directly look at the resources and think about what can be exchanged for something of higher value. Since Sheep (15) is less valuable than Brick (24) and Ore (36), trading Sheep for either could be beneficial.\n\n## Step 9: Consider a trade involving Sheep for a higher-value resource.\nTrading Sheep for Brick or Ore could be beneficial. For example, [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore] or [Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]. For [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore], the calculation is (2*15) = 30 for (1*36) = 36, which is a gain of 6.\n\n## Step 10: Decide on a specific trade.\nLet's make an offer: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 0 Ore -> 1 Ore, 0 Sheep] is not a valid format, but [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore] is a good trade. It gives a gain in value.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]}$",

      "response": "To begin, let's assess the current situation and generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation.\n\n### Initial Assessment\n\n1. **Current Resources and Values:**\n   - Wheat: 21 units, Value: 6 per unit, Total Value: 21 * 6 = 126\n   - Wood: 6 units, Value: 11 per unit, Total Value: 6 * 11 = 66\n   - Sheep: 15 units, Value: 15 per unit, Total Value: 15 * 15 = 225\n   - Brick: 9 units + 1 unit (from trade) = 10 units, Value: 24 per unit, Total Value: 10 * 24 = 240\n   - Ore: 9 units - 2 units (to be received, but actually, we gave 0 Ore and received 0 Ore in the last trade, the last trade involved Wheat and Brick) = 9 units, Value: 36 per unit, Total Value: 9 * 36 = 324\n\n   The actual last trade was: 10 Wheat for 1 Brick. So, the correct quantities after the trade are:\n   - Wheat: 21 - 10 = 11 units\n   - Brick: 9 + 1 = 10 units\n\n2. **Total Value Before and After Trade:**\n   - Before Trade: (21*6) + (6*11) + (15*15) + (9*24) + (9*36) = 126 + 66 + 225 + 216 + 324 = 957\n   - After Trade: (11*6) + (6*11) + (15*15) + (10*24) + (9*36) = 66 + 66 + 225 + 240 + 324 = 921\n\n### Generated Knowledge\n\n1. **Principle of Value Maximization:** The goal is to increase the total value of resources. Trades should be made if they increase the total value.\n\n2. **Comparative Advantage:** Focus on trading resources that are less valuable to you for those that are more valuable.\n\n3. **Resource Valuation:** Understand the value of each resource. The values are given: Wheat (6), Wood (11), Sheep (15), Brick (24), Ore (36).\n\n4. **Current Resource Surplus/Deficit:** Assessing surplus or deficit helps in deciding what to trade. You have a surplus of Sheep and a decent amount of Ore and Brick after the last trade.\n\n5. **Negotiation Strategy:** Since the aim is to increase total value, look for opportunities to trade lower-value resources for higher-value ones.\n\n### Analysis\n\nGiven the current resources and their values, let's analyze the situation:\n\n- The last trade resulted in gaining 1 Brick (Value: 24) for 10 Wheat (Value: 6 each, Total: 60). So, there's a net gain of 24 - 60 = -36 in value. The trade was not favorable in terms of value maximization.\n\n- Current Total Value = 921. To increase this, we need to look for trades that will result in a higher total value.\n\n### Trading Decision\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n\n1. **Trading Wheat:** We have 11 Wheat left. Trading it for higher-value resources could be beneficial. For example, trading Wheat for Brick or Ore.\n\n2. **Trading Sheep:** We have a significant amount of Sheep. If there's an opportunity to trade Sheep for Ore or Brick, it might be beneficial since Sheep (15) is less valuable than Ore (36) but more than Brick (24).\n\nLet's make an offer to Player 1 to trade some of our resources for more valuable ones.\n\n### Offer\n\nConsidering the values, let's offer: `[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 4 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Brick, 0 Ore -> 0 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 0 Wood, 0 Brick, 1 Ore]`\n\nThus, the action is: `[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's execute: `[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThe reasoning is that Sheep is valued at 15, and offering 4 Sheep gives up 4*15 = 60 value for 1 Ore, which is valued at 36. While this seems like a loss (60 > 36), it's a step to potentially adjust our resource distribution. A more favorable trade would be needed to really increase our total value.\n\nHowever, the direct trade value calculation shows it's not beneficial. Let's reassess and adjust our strategy to propose a different trade.\n\n### Reassessment\n\nUpon reassessment, a potentially beneficial trade isn't straightforward given the current resource values and quantities. \n\nLet's directly check for a potentially more beneficial trade: Trading some Wheat or Wood for a higher-value resource like Ore or Brick.\n\n### Alternative Offer\n\nConsidering we have Wheat and the last trade was not very favorable, let's think about trading Wood (since we don't have many and it's relatively less valuable compared to what we can gain).\n\nAn alternative offer could be: `[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n\nValue given up: 3*11 = 33\nValue gained: 1*24 = 24\n\nThis isn't favorable.\n\nLet's think about it again and adjust: \n\nAn alternative could be: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nValue given up: 5*6 = 30\nValue gained: 1*36 = 36\n\nThis is a slightly better trade as it's nearly equal or slightly positive in terms of value.\n\nSo, the action could be: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's execute this offer.\n\nSince we actually have the option to directly propose, let's stick with a similar logic and directly propose a beneficial trade if available.\n\nLet's directly make the offer: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds. \n\nFor now, the action is: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nIn resource trading and negotiation, several key principles and strategies are crucial for maximizing total resource value, especially in a limited-turn game like this one with only 10 turns total. First, **value assessment** is paramount: Always calculate the net value gain or loss for any trade by comparing the total value of resources offered versus those requested, based on your personal valuation. In my case, with resources like Wheat (low per-unit value), Wood (very low per-unit value), Sheep (moderate), Brick (high), and Ore (moderate), I should prioritize trades that convert low-value resources into high-value ones. For instance, my per-unit values are approximately: Wheat (~1), Wood (~0.45), Sheep (~3), Brick (~4), and Ore (~1.83), so trading away abundant, low-value items like Wood or Ore for high-value items like Brick could be advantageous.\n\nSecond, **negotiation strategy** involves accepting beneficial offers while proposing counteroffers to further optimize gains. I should only accept offers that result in a clear net increase in total value, and when making offers, aim for fairness from my perspective to encourage reciprocity, but always ensure I gain more value. Additionally, consider **scarcity and abundance**: I have high quantities of Wood (20 qty) and Ore (18 qty), which are less valuable per unit, making them good candidates for trading. Finally, **game efficiency** is key in a short game\u2014act decisively to build value early. Insights from past trades show Player 0 is willing to offer resources like Sheep, which have higher value to me, so I can leverage this by accepting strong offers and then proposing trades that offload my surpluses.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nBased on the analysis, the incoming offer from Player 0\u20144 Sheep for 1 Ore\u2014results in a net value gain for me. Specifically, gaining 4 Sheep (approximately 4 * 3 = 12 value points) while losing 1 Ore (approximately 1 * 1.83 = 1.83 value points) yields a net gain of about 10.17 value points, increasing my total resource value. Therefore, I will accept this offer. To further maximize my value, I'll propose a new offer trading my abundant, low-value Wood for more high-value Brick.\n\n[Accept]  \n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 2 Brick]",

Consider the offers made by other players and respond accordingly.\n\nHigh-value resources: Ore (Value: 36), Brick (Value: 24)\nLow-value resources: Wheat (Value: 6), Wood (Value: 11)\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Current Situation and Player 1's Offer\nWe received an offer from Player 1: 10 Wood -> 2 Brick.\nLet's analyze this offer:\n- We currently have 10 Brick and the value of Brick is 24. So, 2 Brick = 2 * 24 = 48.\n- We are being offered 10 Wood, and the value of Wood is 11. So, 10 Wood = 10 * 11 = 110.\nSince 110 (value of 10 Wood) is greater than 48 (value of 2 Brick), this offer is beneficial to us.\n\n## Step 4: Make a Trading Decision\nGiven that the offer from Player 1 (10 Wood -> 2 Brick) is beneficial because we receive more value than we give away (110 > 48), we should accept this offer.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the Trading Decision\nTo accept Player 1's offer, we use the '[Accept]' token.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Accept]}$",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nBased on my current situation in the Negotiation Game, where my goal is to increase the total value of my resources through strategic trading, here are the key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are most relevant:\n\n- **Key Principles**:\n  - **Value-Based Decision Making**: Always evaluate trades based on the net value gained or lost. Using the provided resource values, calculate the per-unit value to assess trades accurately. For example, based on my initial resources, the approximate per-unit values are: Wheat (1 value/unit), Wood (0.45 value/unit), Sheep (3 value/unit), Brick (4 value/unit), and Ore (1.83 value/unit). Only proceed with trades where the total value of resources received exceeds the total value of resources given, ensuring a net positive gain in overall resource value.\n  - **Opportunity Cost Awareness**: Recognize that resources have varying scarcity and utility. Trading away abundant or low-value resources (e.g., Wheat or Ore) for higher-value ones (e.g., Brick) can amplify long-term gains, but avoid depleting essential resources that might be needed later.\n  - **Reciprocity and Fairness in Negotiation**: In a multi-turn game like this (with only 10 turns total), builds trust by proposing trades that offer some value to the other player, but always tilt in your favor. This encourages future cooperation while maximizing your advantage.\n\n- **Strategies**:\n  - **Trade Surpluses for High-Value Assets**: Focus on trading resources I have in excess (e.g., I now have 16 Wheat and 17 Ore after previous trades) for resources with higher per-unit value (e.g., Brick at 4 value/unit). This leverages my abundance to address shortages or acquire more valuable items.\n  - **Analyze Opponent Patterns**: From the game history, Player 0 has offered Wheat and Sheep (lower-value resources) in exchange for my Brick and Ore, and they accepted my offer of Wood for Brick. This suggests Player 0 may have a surplus of Brick and a need for other resources like Wood or Ore. I can use this to propose offers that align with their needs while ensuring I gain more value.\n  - **Risk Management**: With limited turns remaining, prioritize quick, high-gain trades over risky or marginal ones. Avoid overtrading in early turns to preserve options, but be proactive since no offer is incoming.\n\n- **Insights**:\n  - **Current Resource Imbalance**: My resources are skewed toward lower-value items (e.g., Wheat at 1 value/unit and Ore at 1.83 value/unit), while I have moderate amounts of higher-value ones like Brick (at 4 value/unit). Trading low-value surpluses for higher-value resources will accelerate my total value growth.\n  - **Game Dynamics**: The game is turn-based and finite, so I should aim for consistent net gains per turn. Past trades show that Player 0 is willing to accept deals where they lose value (e.g., they gave 2 Brick worth 8 value for my 10 Wood worth 4.5 value), indicating they might prioritize quantity or specific needs over strict value optimization. This gives me an opportunity to propose slightly aggressive offers.\n  - **Negotiation Leverage**: By proposing offers that provide marginal value to Player 0, I can encourage acceptance while securing a net gain for myself, fostering ongoing interactions.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge, I first evaluate my current resources after the previous trades:\n- Wheat: 16 qty (total value: 16 * 1 = 16)\n- Wood: 10 qty (total value: 10 * 0.45 = 4.5)\n- Sheep: 10 qty (total value: 10 * 3 = 30)\n- Brick: 8 qty (total value: 8 * 4 = 32)\n- Ore: 17 qty (total value: 17 * 1.83 \u2248 31.14)\n- **Total Current Value**: 16 + 4.5 + 30 + 32 + 31.14 \u2248 113.64\n\nI have a surplus of Wheat (low value per unit) and want to trade it for higher-value resources like Brick, based on Player 0's history of offering Brick. A good strategy is to propose a trade of my abundant, low-value Wheat for Brick, ensuring a net value gain. For instance, offering 10 Wheat (value: 10 * 1 = 10) for 3 Brick (value: 3 * 4 = 12) would result in a net gain of 12 - 10 = 2 value, aligning with value-based decision making and trading surpluses.\n\nThis offer also considers Player 0's patterns (they accepted a similar trade involving Brick) and promotes reciprocity, as it provides them with Wheat they might need. With no incoming offer, I'll proactively make this trade to maximize my gains in this turn-limited game.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Brick]",

The total value of my resources is 935.\n   \n2. **Trade History**: Reviewing past trades helps in understanding what has been exchanged and what might be a good future trade. I've traded 10 Wheat for 1 Brick, 4 Sheep for 1 Ore, and 2 Brick for 10 Wood.\n\n3. **Principle of Comparative Advantage**: It's beneficial to trade resources that are less valuable to me for those that are more valuable. Given the values, Ore is the most valuable per unit, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\n4. **Negotiation Strategy**: To increase the total value of my resources, I should aim to trade resources with lower values per unit for those with higher values per unit. Since I've gained Wood (Value: 11) and Brick (Value: 24) in previous trades, and lost Wheat (Value: 6) and Sheep (Value: 15), it indicates I'm accumulating resources of relatively higher value compared to Wheat but need to be cautious about the overall distribution.\n\n5. **Current Offer**: Player 1 has made an offer: 10 Wheat -> 3 Brick. Given that Wheat is worth 6 and Brick is worth 24, this trade involves exchanging 10*6 = 60 value for 3*24 = 72 value. This seems like a beneficial trade since I'm gaining 12 value.\n\n6. **Resource Quantity and Value**: After the potential trade (10 Wheat -> 3 Brick), my resources would be:\n\t- Wheat: 11 - 10 = 1\n\t- Brick: 10 + 3 = 13\n\tThe new total value would be:\n\t- Wheat: 1 * 6 = 6\n\t- Wood: 16 * 11 = 176\n\t- Sheep: 11 * 15 = 165\n\t- Brick: 13 * 24 = 312\n\t- Ore: 8 * 36 = 288\n\tTotal value = 6 + 176 + 165 + 312 + 288 = 947\n\nThis trade increases my total value from 935 to 947.\n\n## Trading Decision\nTo make my trading decision, I will accept the current offer from Player 1: [Offered items: 10 Wheat -> Requested items: 3 Brick].\n\nThe action is: `[Accept]`.",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nBased on my current situation in the Negotiation Game, here are the key principles, strategies, and insights about resource trading and negotiation that are most relevant:\n\n1. **Personal Valuation and Trade-offs**: The core principle is to only accept or propose trades that increase the total value of my resources, based on my subjective valuations. From the given values, I can calculate per-unit values (derived from initial quantities and total values) as follows: Wheat (1 per unit), Wood (0.45 per unit), Sheep (3 per unit), Brick (4 per unit), and Ore (1.83 per unit). This means I should prioritize acquiring resources with higher per-unit values (like Brick at 4) over those with lower values (like Wood at 0.45). A trade is beneficial only if the value gained exceeds the value lost.\n\n2. **Negotiation Strategy and Reciprocity**: In a competitive game with limited turns (10 total), I should aim for mutually beneficial trades to build goodwill, but always ensure my gains outweigh theirs based on my valuations. Analyze past interactions: Player 0 has repeatedly offered Wheat (which I value lowly at 1 per unit) and accepted my offers involving Wood, so they might value Wheat highly or need Brick. I can leverage this by proposing trades that offload my low-value resources (e.g., Wood) for their higher-value ones (e.g., Brick), while making offers that are attractive enough to be accepted.\n\n3. **Resource Scarcity and Portfolio Balance**: With 6 turns left, I need to manage my resources efficiently. I currently have excesses in Ore (17 qty, moderate value) and Wood (10 qty, low value), which I can trade for scarcer or higher-value resources like Brick (which I value at 4 per unit). Avoid over-trading high-value resources (e.g., Brick) unless the return is exceptional, as this could deplete my portfolio.\n\n4. **Risk and Turn Management**: The game is finite, so I should respond to incoming offers quickly and counter with my own if it advances my goals. Deny offers that decrease my total value to preserve resources for better opportunities. Insights from past trades show Player 0 is willing to trade Wheat for Brick, so I can propose escalated offers to test their limits without overcommitting.\n\n5. **General Negotiation Insights**: Be cautious of imbalanced trades\u2014always calculate net value changes. Use incremental offers (e.g., building on successful past trades like my previous Wood-for-Brick deal) to negotiate incrementally, and avoid revealing too much about my valuations to maintain leverage.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge, my current resources are: Wheat (6 qty), Wood (10 qty), Sheep (10 qty), Brick (11 qty), and Ore (17 qty). My total value is approximately 115.57 (calculated as: 6*1 + 10*0.45 + 10*3 + 11*4 + 17*1.83).\n\nFor Player 0's incoming offer (10 Wheat -> 3 Brick), the value calculation is: I would gain 10 Wheat (10*1 = 10 value) but lose 3 Brick (3*4 = 12 value), resulting in a net loss of 2 value. This does not increase my total value, so I must deny it.\n\nTo advance my position, I'll propose a new offer leveraging my excess Wood (low value at 0.45 per unit) for more Brick (high value at 4 per unit), based on Player 0's past acceptance of similar trades. Offering 10 Wood (value: 10*0.45 = 4.5) for 3 Brick (value: 3*4 = 12) would net me a gain of 7.5 value, which aligns with my goal.\n\n[Deny]  \n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 3 Brick]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nBefore making my trading decision, I'll generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation based on my current situation. Here are the key principles, strategies, and insights that apply:\n\n- **Value-Based Trading**: The core principle is to only engage in trades that increase the total value of my resources. Based on my valuations (e.g., Brick at ~4 value per unit, Sheep at ~3 per unit, Ore at ~1.83 per unit, Wheat at ~1 per unit, and Wood at ~0.45 per unit), I should calculate the net value gain or loss for any trade. For instance, if I offer resources worth X and receive resources worth Y, I should ensure Y > X to justify the trade. This aligns with my goal of maximizing total resource value.\n\n- **Resource Abundance and Scarcity**: I have excess quantities of certain resources (e.g., Sheep: 10 qty, Ore: 17 qty, Brick: 14 qty, Wheat: 6 qty) but lack Wood (0 qty now). I should leverage abundant or less valuable resources to acquire more valuable ones. For example, from the trade history, Player 0 has shown a strong interest in Brick (offering Wheat and Sheep for it multiple times), indicating Brick's high demand. Conversely, I should avoid trading high-value resources like Brick unless I can secure a significant value gain.\n\n- **Negotiation Strategy and History Analysis**: In negotiations, start with offers that favor you but are somewhat reasonable to encourage acceptance. Review past interactions: Player 0 has consistently traded Wheat and Sheep for Brick, suggesting they value Brick highly. I've successfully offered Wood and Wheat for Brick in the past, so I can build on that by proposing trades that exploit their preferences. However, I should be cautious not to overreach, as my previous rejection of their offer (10 Wheat for 3 Brick) shows I won't accept losses. A good strategy is to propose trades that test their willingness while ensuring I gain value, and always aim for incremental gains in a multi-turn game.\n\n- **Risk and Game Dynamics**: With only 10 turns total, I need to act efficiently to maximize value early. If no incoming offer is present, I should proactively make one. Reject or deny unfavorable deals, and use offers to probe for what Player 0 is willing to give. Avoid depleting high-value resources like Brick unless the return is substantial, as this could limit future leverage.\n\nThis knowledge emphasizes calculated, value-driven decisions to ensure long-term gains.\n\n### Apply Knowledge and Make Trading Decision\nApplying the above knowledge, I'll assess my current resources and the trade history. My updated resources are:\n- Wheat: 6 qty (value: ~1 per unit)\n- Wood: 0 qty (value: ~0.45 per unit) \u2013 I have none left, so I can't offer this.\n- Sheep: 10 qty (value: ~3 per unit) \u2013 Abundant and moderately valuable.\n- Brick: 14 qty (value: ~4 per unit) \u2013 High value and in demand by Player 0.\n- Ore: 17 qty (value: ~1.83 per unit) \u2013 Abundant but lower value.\n\nFrom history, Player 0 values Brick highly and has offered Wheat and Sheep in exchange. I want to propose a trade that exploits this while ensuring a net value gain. For example, offering 1 Brick (~4 value) for resources that exceed this value to me, like Sheep (~3 per unit). A trade of 1 Brick for 4 Sheep would give me 4 Sheep (~12 value) in return, resulting in a net gain of ~8 value.\n\nThis proposal aligns with value-based trading (gaining more value), leverages scarcity (Player 0 wants Brick), and uses negotiation strategy (building on past successes). Since there's no incoming offer to accept or deny, I'll make a new offer.\n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 4 Sheep]",

      "response": "To tackle this task effectively, let's first assess the current situation and then generate relevant knowledge about resource trading and negotiation.\n\n### Current Situation\n\nAfter several trades, the current state of resources for Player 0 is as follows:\n\n1. Initial Resources and Values:\n   - Wheat: 21, Value: 6\n   - Wood: 6, Value: 11\n   - Sheep: 15, Value: 15\n   - Brick: 9, Value: 24\n   - Ore: 9, Value: 36\n\n2. Trades Made:\n   - Offered 10 Wheat for 1 Brick: \n     - Wheat: 21 - 10 = 11\n     - Brick: 9 + 1 = 10\n   - Offered 4 Sheep for 1 Ore:\n     - Sheep: 15 - 4 = 11\n     - Ore: 9 + 1 = 10\n   - Accepted 10 Wood for 2 Brick:\n     - Wood: 6 + 10 = 16\n     - Brick: 10 - 2 = 8\n   - Accepted 10 Wheat for 3 Brick:\n     - Wheat: 11 + 10 = 21\n     - Brick: 8 + 3 = 11\n   - Accepted 10 Wood for 3 Brick:\n     - Wood: 16 + 10 = 26\n     - Brick: 11 - 3 = 8\n\nCurrent Resources and Values:\n   - Wheat: 21, Value: 6\n   - Wood: 26, Value: 11\n   - Sheep: 11, Value: 15\n   - Brick: 8, Value: 24\n   - Ore: 10, Value: 36\n\n### Generating Knowledge\n\n1. **Value Maximization**: The goal is to maximize the total value of resources. To do so, we should aim to acquire resources with higher values and possibly trade away resources with lower values if they are abundant.\n\n2. **Assessing Current Resources**: \n   - The total initial value = (21*6) + (6*11) + (15*15) + (9*24) + (9*36) = 126 + 66 + 225 + 216 + 324 = 957.\n   - The current total value = (21*6) + (26*11) + (11*15) + (8*24) + (10*36) = 126 + 286 + 165 + 192 + 360 = 1129.\n\n3. **Relative Value of Resources**: Ore has the highest value per unit, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat. We should try to accumulate more of the higher-value resources.\n\n4. **Negotiation Strategies**:\n   - **Conserve High-Value Resources**: Try not to give away high-value resources unless getting an even more valuable resource in return.\n   - **Accumulate High-Value Resources**: Look for opportunities to gain Ore, Brick, and Sheep.\n   - **Utilize Abundant Resources**: If we have a surplus of a lower-value resource, consider trading it for a higher-value one.\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\nThe current total value of resources is 1129, which is higher than the initial total value of 957. This indicates that the trades made so far have been beneficial.\n\n### Responding to the Latest Offer\n\nPlayer 1 made an offer: 1 Brick -> 4 Sheep.\n\n- Current Resources:\n  - Brick: 8\n  - Sheep: 11\n\n- If accepted:\n  - Brick: 8 + 1 = 9\n  - Sheep: 11 - 4 = 7\n\nLet's evaluate the value change:\n- Giving away 4 Sheep (4*15 = 60) for 1 Brick (1*24 = 24) is not beneficial as we're losing value (60 > 24).\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the latest offer from Player 1 (1 Brick -> 4 Sheep), accepting it would decrease our total value because we're giving away more valuable resources (Sheep) for less valuable ones (Brick) in terms of total value exchanged.\n\nThe appropriate action is: `[Deny]`.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nAfter denying the offer, we should consider making a new offer that aligns with our strategy of maximizing the total value of resources. We have a good amount of Wheat and Wood. Let's think about a potential trade that could be beneficial.\n\nSince Ore is highly valued and we already have a decent amount of it, let's see if we can get more or maintain our current high-value resources. We could offer some of our Wheat or Wood for more Ore or Brick.\n\nLet's propose: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`.\n\nThis translates to: `[Offer: 5 Wheat, 0 Ore -> 0 Wheat, 1 Ore]`.\n\nSo, the action is: `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`. \n\nTherefore, the response to the situation is: `[Deny]` followed by a new offer `[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`.",
