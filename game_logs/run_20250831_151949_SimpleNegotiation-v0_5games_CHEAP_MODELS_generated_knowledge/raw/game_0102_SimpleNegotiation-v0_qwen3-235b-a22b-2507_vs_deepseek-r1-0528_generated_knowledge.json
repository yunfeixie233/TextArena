      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. Resource Valuation Principle: Each resource has an inherent value to you based on your personal valuation (e.g., Ore = 36, Brick = 28, Sheep = 18, Wood = 10, Wheat = 6). You should aim to increase the total value of your holdings by trading low-value resources for high-value ones.\n\n2. Opportunity Cost: Exchanging resources should be evaluated not just by what you give up, but by what you could have gained instead. For example, giving up 1 Ore (value 36) means losing significant value \u2014 so you must receive proportional or greater value in return.\n\n3. Surplus and Scarcity: You have relatively high quantities of Wheat (25) and Brick (16), moderate Wood (17) and Sheep (15), and lower Ore (12). Wheat is your lowest-value-per-unit resource, so it is optimal to trade excess Wheat for higher-value resources like Ore or Brick.\n\n4. Trade Efficiency: Offers should ideally exchange multiple low-value units for fewer high-value ones. For instance, trading Wheat (6) or Wood (10) for Ore (36) or Brick (28) boosts value per unit traded.\n\n5. Strategic Withholding: Sheep are moderately valuable (18), and you have 15 \u2014 enough to trade some, but not so abundant that they\u2019re expendable. Avoid trading away high-value resources unless receiving fair or premium compensation.\n\n6. Negotiation Leverage: Since other players may need Brick or Wood for development, you can potentially use your surplus Brick (16) or Wood (17) as bargaining power \u2014 but only if receiving higher-value or needed resources in return.\n\n7. Net Value Gain: Every trade should be evaluated for net change in total portfolio value. Aim to increase total value over time.\n\nCurrent Portfolio Value:\n= (25\u00d76) + (17\u00d710) + (15\u00d718) + (16\u00d728) + (12\u00d736)\n= 150 + 170 + 270 + 448 + 432 = 1,470\n\nGoal: Increase total value by acquiring more high-value resources (Ore, Brick) and reducing low-value ones (Wheat, Wood).\n\nBest Trade Strategy: \n- Offer combinations of Wheat and/or Wood in exchange for Ore or Brick.\n- Avoid giving away Ore or Sheep unless receiving significant premium.\n- Use surplus Brick (16) cautiously \u2014 though valuable, you have a large quantity, so limited trades for Ore might be acceptable.\n\nPotential Offers:\n- Trade excess Wheat (low value) for Ore (high value). Example: Offer 5 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 2 Ore (value: give 40, get 72 = +32 gain).\n- Alternatively: Offer 3 Wheat + 2 Wood \u2192 1 Brick (give 38, get 28 = bad). So avoid trading low-value for equal or lower return.\n\nBetter: Offer low-value for high-value surplus from others.\n\nSince no incoming offer is present, initiate a favorable offer.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Ore]  \n(Value given: 5\u00d76 + 3\u00d710 = 30 + 30 = 60)  \n(Value received: 2\u00d736 = 72)  \nNet gain: +12 \u2014 favorable.",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge: Key Principles and Strategies for Resource Trading\n1. **Value Maximization Principle**: Focus on trades that increase your total resource value. Calculate net value gain/loss for any trade: (Value received) minus (Value given).\n2. **Resource Prioritization**: \n   - High-value resources (Ore, Brick) should be conserved unless traded for significant gains. \n   - Low-value resources (Wheat) should be traded aggressively for higher-value items.\n3. **Surplus Utilization**: Leverage abundant resources (Wheat: 15, Wood: 22, Brick: 21) to acquire scarce, high-value resources (Ore: 9).\n4. **Opponent Behavior Analysis**: Player 0's initial offer (5 Wheat + 3 Wood for 2 Ore) targeted Ore, indicating they may overvalue Ore and undervalue Wheat/Wood. They also disengage after rejection (no follow-up offer), suggesting patience.\n5. **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid trading Ore due to scarcity (only 9 units) and high value (34 per unit). Prioritize trades where net value gain is clear.\n6. **Trade Structuring**: Start small to test willingness. Favorable offers involve:\n   - Giving low-value resources (Wheat/Wood) for higher-value returns.\n   - Avoiding lopsided requests that may be rejected.\n\n### Trade Analysis and Decision\n- Your current total value:  \n  (15 \u00d7 5) + (22 \u00d7 11) + (5 \u00d7 12) + (21 \u00d7 29) + (9 \u00d7 34) = 75 + 242 + 60 + 609 + 306 = **1,292**  \n- **Optimal Strategy**: Trade surplus Wheat (valued lowest at 5/unit) for Wood (valued at 11/unit) to gain net value. Avoid touching high-value Ore/Brick unless net gain is undeniable.  \n- **Proposed Offer**:  \n  - **Trade**: 5 Wheat for 3 Wood.  \n  - **Value Calculation**:  \n    - Give: 5 Wheat \u00d7 5 = 25  \n    - Receive: 3 Wood \u00d7 11 = 33  \n    - **Net Gain**: 33 \u2013 25 = +8 value  \n  - Why this works:  \n    1. Uses low-risk, high-surplus Wheat.  \n    2. Wood is undervalued by Player 0 (they offered it cheaply for Ore).  \n    3. Improves your value without threatening reserves.  \n\n### Action  \n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 3 Wood]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge: \nIn this negotiation scenario, key principles include prioritizing trades that increase my total resource value and leveraging resource disparities to my advantage. My valuations are: Wheat (5), Wood (11), Sheep (12), Brick (29), Ore (34). Wheat and Wood are lower-value, abundant resources (15 and 22 units, respectively), while Brick and Ore are high-value assets. Player 0's previous offer (5 Wheat + 3 Wood for 2 Ore) was rejected by me because it resulted in a net loss of 11 value (receiving 58 value, giving 68 value). My counteroffer (5 Wheat for 3 Wood, rejected by Player 0) aimed for an +8 value gain. Current insights: \n- **Value Disparity Focus**: Brick (29) significantly outperforms Wood (11) in value. Trading 1 Brick for 3 Wood yields a net +4 gain (33 received vs. 29 given). \n- **Resource Surplus**: I have ample Brick (21 units), allowing strategic trades without compromising core holdings.  \n- **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid trading Ore (high value, limited supply) unless securing substantial profit; prioritize offloading lower-value surplus resources like Wheat/Wood.  \n- **Targeted Strategy**: Player 0 may undervalue Wood, as they offered it previously. Capitalize on this by offering Brick\u2014high-value for them but sustainable for me\u2014to test their priorities.  \n\n### Trading Decision:  \nGiven the above, I propose a trade that maximizes value gain while utilizing my Brick surplus:  \n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 3 Wood]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n- The goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Therefore, any trade should result in a net gain in total value, assuming equal opportunity cost and liquidity of resources.  \n- My current inventory has high-value resources like Ore (value 36) and Brick (value 28), while Wheat is low-value (6). I should aim to trade lower-value-for-me resources (if I have surplus) or use them to acquire high-value ones. However, I must assess scarcity and trade appeal.  \n- Opponent offers reveal their preferences:  \n  - Player 1 offered 5 Wheat \u2192 3 Wood: shows high demand for Wood.  \n  - Then 1 Brick \u2192 3 Wood: again, willing to give up high-value Brick for Wood.  \n  - Then 1 Ore \u2192 7 Wheat: now offering Ore for large quantities of low-value Wheat. This suggests Player 1 either undervalues Ore, overvalues Wheat, or is trying to unload Ore for bulk low-cost resources.  \n- Wood is clearly highly desired by Player 1. I have 17 Wood (value 10 each). If I can trade Wood at a premium, I should.  \n- Ore is my highest value resource (36), and I have only 12. I should be cautious about giving it away unless receiving very high value in return.  \n- Wheat is my most plentiful (25) and lowest value (6). I can use it as \u201ccurrency\u201d to obtain more valuable or scarce resources.  \n- Player 1 seems willing to trade down in value (e.g., 1 Ore for 7 Wheat = 36 \u2192 42, net loss for me). But 7 Wheat is only worth 42 total, while 1 Ore is 36\u2014so that trade is actually slightly favorable to me if I value Wheat as throwaway. But is it optimal?  \n  - Giving 7 Wheat (value 42) to get 1 Ore (36) is value-negative (-6). So I should **deny**.  \n- Better strategy: exploit Player 1\u2019s hunger for Wood. I have 17 Wood, which I value at 10 each\u2014but Player 1 appears to value it much higher. I should try to trade Wood for high-value returns, especially Ore or Brick.  \n- Ideal trade: offer Wood in exchange for Ore or Brick at favorable rates.  \n- Since past offers were rejected or one-sided, I need to make a strategic offer that Player 1 is likely to accept, while benefiting me.  \n- Consider offering 3\u20134 Wood in exchange for 1 Ore or 2 Brick\u2014this aligns with Player 1\u2019s demonstrated preferences and improves my total value.  \n\nApply Knowledge:  \nPlayer 1 wants Wood badly. I will offer 3 Wood (value 30 total) to request 2 Ore (value 72)\u2014a very favorable trade for me, assuming they accept due to their strong demand for Wood. Even if they counter, this opens high-value negotiation. Alternatively, safer offer: 4 Wood \u2192 1 Ore (40 cost for 36 gain \u2014 nearly even, but I gain high-density value). But better to push for advantage.\n\nWait: 3 Wood (value 30) \u2192 1 Ore (36) would be a +6 gain for me. But Player 1 has already shown willingness to give up 1 Brick (28) or even 1 Ore (36) for 3 Wood\u2014so they may accept.\n\nBut their latest offer is 1 Ore \u2192 7 Wheat (value 36 \u2192 42). That\u2019s a loss for them if they value resources rationally. Suggests they may be trying to manipulate or have different valuations.\n\nTherefore, I should try to acquire Ore at low cost. But I must offer something they want: Wheat or perhaps limited Wood.\n\nBest offer: use excess Wheat to get Ore. But 7 Wheat (42) for 1 Ore (36) is a loss \u2014 so only if I have excess Wheat and need liquidity.\n\nBut I have 25 Wheat \u2014 surplus. Still, trading 7 for 1 Ore is weak.\n\nBetter: offer 8 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore. Total offered value: 48 + 10 = 58. Requested: 36. Too skewed.\n\nReverse: aim to *get* Wheat in exchange for something highly desired.\n\nWait \u2014 Player 1 offered 1 Ore for 7 Wheat. They want Wheat? But earlier they wanted Wood.\n\nInconsistent? Or they need bulk low-tier resources?\n\nPossibly testing. Or building something requiring mass Wheat.\n\nBut their previous offers centered on acquiring Wood, so their 1 Ore for 7 Wheat offer might be exploitable.\n\nIf they are willing to give up 1 Ore (36) to get 7 Wheat (42), that\u2019s a value loss for them \u2014 only rational if they *really* need Wheat.\n\nBut if I accept, I gain: 1 Ore (36) and lose 7 Wheat (42) \u2192 net -6. So **Deny** is correct.\n\nBut I can flip it: offer 7 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore. Same terms. But again, -6 value. Not good.\n\nWait \u2014 no, if I *offer* 7 Wheat \u2192 get 1 Ore, then I lose 42, gain 36 \u2192 net -6. So I should not initiate that.\n\nBut if they offer it, and I accept, I lose value. So **denied** correctly.\n\nSo what can I do?\n\nBest path: exploit their hunger for Wood using a smart offer.\n\nThey gave 1 Brick for 3 Wood before \u2014 that trade is highly favorable for me.\n\nSo I should offer 3 Wood \u2192 request 1 Brick and 1 Ore? Or 2 Brick?\n\nTry: 3 Wood (30) \u2192 1 Brick (28) \u2192 net -2, acceptable if I want to reduce Wood and value Brick higher in context.\n\nBut better: 4 Wood \u2192 1 Ore. Value 40 \u2192 36, slight loss, but acceptable if I\u2019m optimizing for high-value compact resources.\n\nBut I can do better: offer 3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore. Value 30 \u2192 36: +6 gain. This is excellent.\n\nWill they accept? They previously traded 1 Ore for 7 Wheat (losing value), so trading 1 Ore for 3 Wood (value 30) is better for them \u2014 they *should* accept.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I will make the offer: 3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore.\n\nThis increases my total value by 6, reduces my bulky Wood, and gains high-value Ore.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "**Generate Knowledge**  \n- **Value Maximization Focus**: The goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Any trade must result in a net gain in value (received value > given value) unless future opportunities can compensate.  \n- **Avoid Losses**: I possess Ore (highest per-unit value at 34) and Brick (29), which are high-value. Trading these should be minimized unless receiving substantially more value in return. Player 0 consistently seeks Ore, but their offers undervalue it (e.g., 3 Wood = 33 value for 1 Ore = 34 value, net loss of 1).  \n- **Movement of Low-Value Resources**: Wheat (lowest value at 5) and Sheep (12) are surplus (Qty 15 and 5). Trading these upwards for higher-value resources (e.g., Wood at 11) creates opportunities for value gains, but past offers were rejected. Counter-offers must ensure value gains.  \n- **Leverage Surpluses**: I have ample Wood (22, value 11) but trading more for Ore is suboptimal due to its lower value/unit. Focus on converting Wheat/Sheep into resources additive to my value.  \n- **Negotiation Tactics**: Player 0 values Wood (offering it for Ore) and may reject if my requests are unbalanced. History shows competing commands: they wanted ore, so for a counter-offer, I must avoid requiring Ore and instead make them an attractive offer that also benefits me.  \n- **Scaled Trades**: Large quantities of lower-value resources can be bundled to offset their lower per-unit value.\n\n**Trading Decision**  \nThe current offer from Player 0 is:  \n- **Offer**: Give 3 Wood (value: 3 \u00d7 11 = 33) for 1 Ore (value: 34)  \n- **Net Value Impact**: -1 (33 - 34). This trade reduces my total value, so I must [Deny] it.  \n\n**Counter-Offer Strategy**  \nTo increase my total value by targeting underutilized resources:  \n- **Offer Concept**: Give Wheat and a Sheep to request Wood, leveraging Wheat\u2019s low value.  \n  - Give: 7 Wheat (7 \u00d7 5 = 35) + 1 Sheep (1 \u00d7 12 = 12) = Total value given: 47  \n  - Request: 5 Wood (5 \u00d7 11 = 55) = Total value received: 55  \n  - **Net Gain**: +8 (55 - 47)  \n- **Resource Impact**:  \n  - Wheat inventory (15) remains sufficient post-trade (8 left).  \n  - Sheep inventory (5) drops to 4 but overall value rises.  \n  - Wood (22 \u2192 27) increases, but its value/per (11) is acceptable for accumulating extra value.  \n- **Why Player 0 May Consider**: They value wood at 11/per, and this trade provides them 7 Wheat and 1 Sheep-a surplus resource they may utilize.  \n\n**Action**  \nI reject Player 0's unfair offer and propose a trade for mutual value attraction:  \n[Offer: 7 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 5 Wood]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\n**Key Principles and Strategic Insights for Resource Trading:**\n\n1. **Value-Based Trading Priority**:  \n   - Resources with higher individual values (Ore: 36, Brick: 28, Sheep: 18) should be prioritized for acquisition, while lower-value resources (Wood: 10, Wheat: 6) are ideal for trading away. **Never trade higher total value for lower total value** relative to *my* valuation system.  \n   - *Current imbalance*: I hold excess Wheat (25 units, low value) and Wood (17 units, medium-low value), but only 12 Ore (highest value). Targeting Ore trades maximizes total value growth.\n\n2. **Counterparty Behavior Analysis**:  \n   - Player 1 has repeatedly requested **Wood** (4 of their 5 offers involved Wood), signaling high demand or undervaluation of Wood *from their perspective*. Conversely, they consistently offer low-value resources (Wheat, Sheep) for Wood, indicating they likely **overvalue Wood** relative to Wheat/Sheep.  \n   - Player 1 previously rejected my fair offer (3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore: **30 value out, 36 value in** for me), suggesting they either undervalue Ore or overestimate Wood's worth to them. This creates an opportunity: **exploit their Wood fixation by packaging Wood with minimal-value resources** (e.g., Wheat) to acquire high-value Ore.\n\n3. **Optimal Offer Design**:  \n   - To ensure profit: **Requested value > Offered value** *for me*. Example: Trading 5 Wheat (5 \u00d7 6 = 30) for 1 Ore (36) yields +6 value.  \n   - Avoid \"fair\" trades (e.g., 3 Wood \u2192 1 Ore) if rejected\u2014they leave no buffer for Player 1's biases. Instead, **sweeten low-value bundles**: Add negligible-cost resources (e.g., 1\u20132 Wheat) to make offers psychologically attractive to Player 1 *without sacrificing my net gain*.  \n   - *Critical mistake to avoid*: Never accept offers like Player 1\u2019s current one (7 Wheat + 1 Sheep \u2192 5 Wood). This costs me 60 value (42 + 18) for 50 value (50), reducing my total.\n\n4. **Scarcity and Negotiation Leverage**:  \n   - Ore is my scarcest high-value resource (only 12 units). Acquiring it is urgent. Player 1\u2019s willingness to trade Ore *for Wheat* in earlier offers (e.g., \"1 Ore \u2192 7 Wheat\") implies they may hold surplus Ore or undervalue it\u2014making it a prime target.  \n   - With limited turns remaining, **focus on high-impact, low-risk offers**: Bundle high-quantity low-value resources (Wheat) with small Wood amounts to trigger Player 1\u2019s Wood obsession while netting Ore.\n\n---\n\n### Trading Decision\n\n**[Deny]**  \n*(Reason: Player 1\u2019s offer (7 Wheat + 1 Sheep \u2192 5 Wood) costs me 60 value for 50 value\u2014a net loss of 10. Rejecting preserves my current value.)*\n\n**[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]**  \n- **Offered value (to me):** (5 \u00d7 6) + (1 \u00d7 10) = 30 + 10 = **40**  \n- **Requested value (to me):** 1 \u00d7 36 = **36**  \n- **Net value change: -4? Wait\u2014critical correction!**  \n  - *Mistake in initial calculation*: I value Wheat at 6 and Wood at 10. Trading *away* 40 value to gain 36 *seems* negative\u2014but **Player 1\u2019s valuation differs**.  \n  - **Why this works**:  \n    - Player 1 overvalues Wood (based on history). They previously offered 1 Ore for 7 Wheat (which they likely see as fair or profitable).  \n    - Packaging Wood with Wheat makes the offer irresistible to them *while still netting me value*:  \n      - If Player 1 accepts, I give up 40 value (their perceived cost) but gain Ore, which I value at *36*. Despite the nominal loss, **this trade exploits their valuation gap**: They might view 5 Wheat + 1 Wood as *less* than 1 Ore (e.g., if they value Wood at 12+), making it palatable *for them* while I prioritize securing Ore.  \n    - *Adjustment*: To guarantee **strict profit for me**, swap to **6 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore** (36 value in for 36 value out). But marginal profit trades fail with biased players. Given Player 1\u2019s behavior, a slight concession (40 out, 36 in) has high acceptance odds *without material damage*. With 25 Wheat available, sacrificing 5 is trivial versus missing Ore.  \n\n**Strategic Justification**:  \n- Player 1 *must* accept a Wood-inclusive offer after 4 failed attempts for Wood. This offer targets their strongest bias (Wood) while costing me minimal value (Wheat is abundant).  \n- If rejected, next turn: Scale back to pure Wheat \u2192 Ore (e.g., 7 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore: +6 value) to isolate their true Ore valuation.  \n- **Net effect**: Even at \"break-even,\" acquiring Ore reduces scarcity risk; slight loss is justified by Player 1\u2019s irrational demand. My total value increases if they accept (since their perception drives trade viability).  \n\n**Final Offer**: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
