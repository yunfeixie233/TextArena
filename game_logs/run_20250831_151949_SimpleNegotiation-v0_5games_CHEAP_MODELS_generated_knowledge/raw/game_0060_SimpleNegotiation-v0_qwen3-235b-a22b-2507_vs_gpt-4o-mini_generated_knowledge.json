      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Value Maximization**: The goal is to increase the total value of my resources. Therefore, I should seek trades that allow me to gain high-value resources (especially Ore, valued at 37) or reduce low-value holdings in exchange for higher-value returns.\n\n2. **Resource Valuation**: My current inventory has varying resource values:\n   - Ore (37) > Brick (20) > Sheep (13) > Wood (8) > Wheat (6)\n   I should prioritize acquiring Ore and Brick, and consider trading away excess Wheat, Wood, or Sheep if it leads to net value gain.\n\n3. **Opportunity Cost & Scarcity**: Ore has the highest value and I already have 22 of it \u2014 possibly a surplus. However, since it's high-value, others may want it, making it a strong bargaining chip. Conversely, Brick is valuable (20) and I only have 8 \u2014 I may want more.\n\n4. **Trade Leverage**: Offering a mix of mid-value resources (e.g., Sheep, Wood, Wheat) in exchange for high-value ones (Ore, Brick) can be effective. But I must avoid giving away too much value for too little return.\n\n5. **Trade Efficiency**: Ideal trades involve exchanging lower-value surplus for higher-value scarcity. Currently, I have high quantities of Wheat (15), Wood (22), Sheep (21), and Ore (22). Brick is relatively low (8), so acquiring more Brick is a priority.\n\n6. **Reciprocity and Incentive**: To get others to trade, my offers must be appealing. Offering resources that are abundant in my inventory but possibly scarce in others\u2019 (e.g., Ore or Wood) can make my offers attractive.\n\n7. **Strategic Withholding**: Since the game lasts 10 turns, I don\u2019t need to trade immediately. However, early value-accumulating trades can compound over time.\n\n8. **Avoid Circular Losses**: Be cautious of offers where I give high-value resources for lower-value ones, or for the same resource (e.g., giving Ore for more Ore).\n\n9. **Monitor Imbalances**: My Sheep quantity is high (21) and value is moderate (13). This makes Sheep a good candidate to trade away in bulk for higher-value resources.\n\n10. **Trade Ratios**: Approximate value equivalence should guide trades. For example:\n    - 1 Ore (37) \u2248 2 Brick (40) \u2192 fair trade\n    - 1 Sheep (13) \u2248 2 Wood (16) \u2014 slight surplus for Wood\n    - So, 2 Sheep (26) + 1 Wood (8) = 34 ~ 1 Ore (37) is close\n\nGiven that I have surplus Sheep and sufficient Ore, but need more Brick, a good strategy is to **offer Sheep and/or Wood in exchange for Brick or Ore** \u2014 but only if the value gained exceeds value given.\n\nSince I already have 22 Ore (highest value), I should **avoid giving away Ore unless receiving something of equal or greater value** (e.g., multiple Brick or high-value bundle).\n\nBest move: Use surplus Sheep to acquire more Brick.\n\nCurrent Brick quantity: 8 (valuable at 20 each) \u2192 increasing this would boost portfolio value.\n\nExample trade: Offer 3 Sheep (3\u00d713=39 value) for 2 Brick (2\u00d720=40) \u2192 slight gain.\n\nBut giving 3 Sheep for 2 Brick is favorable for me.\n\nHowever, to make offer more appealing to others, might need to include lower-value resources.\n\nBut as a strategic offer, I can propose a trade that benefits me while being acceptable to others.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 5 Brick]  \nValue out: 3\u00d713 + 2\u00d78 = 39 + 16 = 55  \nValue in: 5\u00d720 = 100  \nNet gain: +45 \u2192 highly favorable\n\nBut unlikely to be accepted \u2014 giving only 55 value for 100? Too good to be true.\n\nNeed balanced offer.\n\nBetter: Offer more for less value out.\n\nTry: [Offer: 5 Sheep -> 2 Brick]  \nValue out: 5\u00d713 = 65  \nValue in: 2\u00d720 = 40 \u2192 bad, I lose value\n\nNo.\n\nReverse: I want to **receive** Brick, so I must **offer** something valuable.\n\nBut to gain value, I must receive more value than I give.\n\nSo ideal: give low-value/high-supply resource for high-value resource.\n\nBest ratio: Use Sheep (13) to get Brick (20). So for each Brick, I should give no more than 1.5 Sheep (~26 value per 20).\n\nSo: 2 Sheep (26) \u2192 1 Brick (20): I lose 6 value \u2192 bad\n\nNo favorable direct trade.\n\nBut maybe with mix.\n\nAlternatively: Offer lower-value resource like Wood.\n\nWood is 8, so 2 Wood = 16, 3 Wood = 24 \u2192 could trade for 1 Brick (20) \u2192 fair.\n\nBut I have 22 Wood \u2014 surplus.\n\nSo: [Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]  \nOut: 3\u00d78 + 13 = 24 + 13 = 37  \nIn: 2\u00d720 = 40 \u2192 net +3 \u2192 slight gain\n\nAcceptable.\n\nBut perhaps better: since Ore is highest value, others may want it \u2014 I have 22, so I can use small amounts as bait.\n\nBut must not undervalue Ore.\n\n1 Ore = 37  \n1 Brick = 20 \u2192 so 1 Ore ~ 1.85 Brick \u2192 so 2 Brick (40) for 1 Ore (37) is good for me.\n\nSo: [Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]  \nValue out: 37  \nValue in: 40 \u2192 net +3\n\nExcellent.\n\nAnd since I have 22 Ore, giving 1 is fine.\n\nThis trade increases my total resource value.\n\nAlso, Brick is only 8 \u2014 getting more Brick improves portfolio.\n\nThis offer is rational and slightly advantageous to me, but plausible for another player to accept if they need Ore.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: What key principles, strategies, or insights about resource trading and negotiation are most relevant to your current situation?\n\n1. **Resource Scarcity and Value Asymmetry**: Other players may value resources differently based on their own needs (e.g., building roads requires Brick and Wood, cities require Ore and Wheat, etc.). Since Ore is the highest-value resource in my inventory (value: 37), it is likely scarce and valuable\u2014trading it should yield high returns. Conversely, I have high quantities of Wheat (15) and Ore (22), which may be surplus and useful to trade.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost and Trade Efficiency**: Trading low-value surplus for high-value scarce resources increases total value. I have only 8 Brick, which are high value (value: 20), so acquiring more Brick increases my leverage. However, trading Sheep (value 13) and Wood (value 8) for Brick (value 20) may be favorable\u2014especially if other players need Sheep or Wood for development cards or settlements.\n\n3. **Negotiation Leverage and Anchoring**: The initial offer sets the negotiation frame. My previous offer (3 Sheep, 2 Wood \u2192 5 Brick) undercuts the relative value:  \n   - Offered: (3\u00d713) + (2\u00d78) = 39 + 16 = 55  \n   - Requested: 5\u00d720 = 100  \n   - This asks for double the value\u2014an aggressive offer that likely caused rejection. I should revise to improve fairness and reciprocity.\n\n4. **Build Trust & Iterative Negotiation**: After rejection, adjusting terms shows willingness to cooperate, increasing chance of future acceptance. Offering slight surplus in request or slight discount in offer may entice counterpart.\n\n5. **Inventory Optimization**: I have 21 Sheep\u2014moderately high. Sheep are mid-value; useful for development cards, but surplus indicates trade-worthiness. Wood (22) is abundant. Wheat (15) high, but not yet strategic. Ore (22) is high-value and powerful\u2014should be spent to gain advantage, not hoarded without purpose.\n\n6. **Strategic Realism**: Player 1 may not have 5 Brick, or may value them highly. My new offer should reflect feasible quantities and balanced exchange rates (e.g., ~1:1 value ratio).\n\nRevised Trade Strategy:\n- Reduce requested amount or increase offered quantity with better balance.\n- Alternatively, target acquiring Wheat or Ore if trading down, but I already have surplus Wheat.\n- Best path: Acquire Brick or resources closer to Ore's value per unit.\n\nConsider revised offer: Trade more Sheep and Wood (lower value to me, possibly needed by others) for Brick (high value to me).

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \nIn resource-based negotiation games, several key principles govern successful trading:\n\n1. **Value Asymmetry**: The foundation of beneficial trades lies in differing valuations of resources between players. A trade is profitable when each party values what they receive more than what they give, subjectively. While base values are known, each player\u2019s hidden needs (e.g., building phases, upcoming upgrades) may shift their effective valuation.\n\n2. **Resource Scarcity and Utility**: Higher-value resources (like Ore at value 37) are often scarcer or more critical for high-tier actions. Players may be reluctant to part with them unless adequately compensated. Lower-value resources may be traded in larger quantities to match the perceived value of high-value items.\n\n3. **Marginal Utility**: Holding large quantities of a resource decreases its marginal utility to you. You may benefit more by trading surplus resources (e.g., excess Wheat or Wood) for rarer, higher-value resources you lack (e.g., Brick or Ore, though you already have substantial Ore).\n\n4. **Incremental Improvement**: Smaller, more balanced offers are more likely to be accepted than lopsided or large-volume trades. Player 1 accepted an offer of (4 Sheep + 3 Wood \u2192 4 Brick), suggesting they value Brick highly and are willing to give up moderate resources for it.\n\n5. **Brick is High-Value (20)**: You currently have only 8 Brick. Given its high per-unit value, increasing Brick holdings could significantly increase your total resource value. Brick appears to be in demand (Player 1 accepted Brick-for-Sheep/Wood), suggesting it may be scarce or strategically vital.\n\n6. **Sheep and Wood are Moderate Value, Possibly Surplus**: You have 21 Sheep and 22 Wood. After trading 4 Sheep and 3 Wood successfully, you still have (17 Sheep, 19 Wood, 8 Brick, 22 Ore, 15 Wheat). Since Sheep are valued at 13 and Wood at 8, trading some of your surplus Sheep or Wood for Brick offers a clear path to value gain.\n\n7. **Offer Design**: To maximize acceptance, offers should appear balanced or slightly favorable to the receiver. Based on the last accepted trade, 4 Sheep + 3 Wood \u2248 4 Brick in perceived value to Player 1. We can extrapolate that Player 1 may accept similar ratios.\n\n8. **Strategic Patience**: Repeated, slightly varied offers help probe the opponent\u2019s valuation without revealing full intent. Since Player 1 did not make a counter-offer, they may be reactive\u2014so initiating another offer is advantageous.\n\nApplication to Decision:  \nTo increase your total resource value, prioritize acquiring more Brick (value 20), which is higher than Sheep (13) or Wood (8). You have surplus Sheep and Wood, so trading them at a favorable rate for Brick is optimal.\n\nYour last offer (4 Sheep, 3 Wood \u2192 4 Brick) was accepted. To continue this favorable trend, propose a similar or slightly improved offer.\n\n[Offer: 5 Sheep, 4 Wood -> 5 Brick]",

Each resource has a specific quantity and value, which needs to be assessed before entering any negotiation.\n\n2. **Supply and Demand**: Consider the value of what both players want. If a resource is in high demand for the other player, it may be a strong bargaining chip.\n\n3. **Resource Diversification**: Instead of focusing solely on one type of resource, diversifying your offers can attract interest and lead to successful trades.\n\n4. **Negotiation Leverage**: The more valuable resources you possess (in terms of overall worth), the more leverage you have in negotiations. Targeting trades that boost your lesser-valued resources can be beneficial.\n\n5. **Trade Ratio Consideration**: Analyze trade offers in terms of their ratio.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: Key principles relevant to this situation include understanding value asymmetry (players value resources differently), anchoring on previously accepted terms, and maintaining favorable trade ratios. Player 1 accepted a trade where Player 0 offered 1 Sheep + 0.75 Wood per Brick (4S+3W\u21924B), but rejected both a similar ratio with higher quantities (5S+4W\u21925B at 1S+0.8W per Brick) and earlier unfavorable offers. This suggests Player 1 prioritizes resource ratios over absolute quantity and may have diminishing Brick availability. To maximize gains while ensuring acceptance, Player 0 should replicate the proven ratio (1S:0.75W per B) or improve it slightly for Player 1. Since Player 0\u2019s Brick (20) > Sheep (13) > Wood (8) in value, trading excess Sheep/Wood for Brick remains optimal.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: What key principles, strategies, or insights about resource trading and negotiation are most relevant to your situation?\n\n- **Value Asymmetry**: Effective trades exploit differences in perceived value between players. Since my private values are known to me (Brick = 20, Ore = 37), I should aim to acquire higher-value resources (like Brick) at the lowest possible cost in lower-value resources.\n\n- **Resource Scarcity & Demand**: Brick has the highest value (20) after Ore (37), and I only have 8 Brick. To maximize total value, increasing Brick quantity efficiently is critical. However, Brick may be scarce or high-demand, so repeated offers involving Brick must be calibrated.\n\n- **Trading Efficiency**: I cannot trade for Ore (highest value) unless Player 1 has surplus Ore and is willing to trade. But since all my offers have focused on acquiring Brick, and Player 1 accepted two identical deals (4 Sheep + 3 Wood \u2192 4 Brick), this reveals that Player 1 is willing to accept that exchange rate.\n\n- **Pattern Recognition & Exploitation**: Player 1 accepted two offers of [4 Sheep, 3 Wood \u2192 4 Brick], but rejected [3 Sheep, 2 Wood \u2192 5 Brick] and [5 Sheep, 4 Wood \u2192 5 Brick]. This suggests:\n   - The ratio matters: 4 Brick for 4 Sheep + 3 Wood was acceptable.\n   - Increasing the ask to 5 Brick (even with lower offer cost) was rejected.\n   - Repeating the *exact* successful offer appears to be a reliable strategy.\n\n- **Diminishing Returns & Saturation**: Player 1 may become less willing to trade the same deal repeatedly. But since Player 1 accepted it twice already, and made no counter-offer, they likely still have Brick and value Sheep and Wood.\n\n- **Consistency in Offers**: Mimicking previously accepted offers increases chance of acceptance. Deviating\u2014even slightly\u2014reduced success.\n\n- **Opportunity Cost**: Using Wood and Sheep (lower value per unit: Wood=8, Sheep=13) to acquire Brick (20) increases total value when the trade ratio is favorable. Each accepted trade of 4 Sheep (4\u00d713=52) and 3 Wood (3\u00d78=24) \u2192 4 Brick (4\u00d720=80) yields a net value gain of 80 - (52+24) = +4 per trade.\n\n- **Inventory Management**: After two such trades, I have:\n   - Started with: 15 Wheat, 22 Wood, 21 Sheep, 8 Brick, 22 Ore\n   - Traded twice: 8 Sheep (4\u00d72), 6 Wood (3\u00d72) \u2192 8 Brick (4\u00d72)\n   - Current: 15 Wheat, 16 Wood, 13 Sheep, 16 Brick, 22 Ore\n   - Brick doubled; still positive trade potential.\n\n- **Risk Minimization**: Since Player 1 has not made a counter-offer, they are likely passive. Best strategy: repeat the *exact* accepted offer to maximize chance of acceptance.\n\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 3 Wood -> 4 Brick]",

Each resource has a different worth; therefore, trading a high-value resource for several lower-value ones may not be beneficial.\n\n2. **Scarcity and Demand**: Resources that are in higher demand or are scarcer can be traded for more significant value. Knowing what the other player needs can help leverage trades better.\n\n3. **Strategic Giving**: When making trades, offering multiple types of resources can increase the chances of acceptance. Players may prefer a diverse offering, especially when they need to balance their resource pool.\n\n4. **Positioning**: As you negotiate, position your trades so that both parties feel they are gaining something valuable. This fosters a better trading environment and encourages future negotiation.\n\n5. **Trade History**: Pay attention to the other player's previous offers and trades.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Resource Value Hierarchy**: The value of each resource is fixed and known. Ore (37) > Brick (20) > Sheep (13) > Wood (8) > Wheat (6). Prioritize acquiring high-value resources (Brick, Ore) and minimize loss of low-value resources unless surplus.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost and Surplus Leverage**: I have high quantities of Sheep (21), Wood (22), and Ore (22). These can be used as trading leverage. Brick is high-value but I only have 8 \u2014 likely in demand. However, in previous rounds, Player 1 accepted trades giving 4 Brick for 4 Sheep + 3 Wood. This suggests Player 1 values Brick and is willing to trade Sheep and Wood for it.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition**: Player 1 accepted two identical offers: [4 Sheep + 3 Wood \u2192 4 Brick]. Then rejected a similar one. But now Player 1 has made a counter-offer: [5 Brick + 3 Wood \u2192 8 Sheep].

Their offer gives away 5 Brick (high value) for 8 Sheep \u2014 favorable to me if I can gain high-value resources.\n\n4. **Trade Efficiency**: I should aim to maximize net value increase. Giving up lower-value resources (Sheep at 13, Wood at 8) to gain higher-value ones (Brick at 20) improves portfolio value. However, losing too much Sheep may reduce future trading power.\n\n5. **Negotiation Strategy**:  \n   - If my offer is rejected, consider adjusting terms slightly or probing with different ratios.  \n   - When receiving an offer, compare the value exchange.  \n   - Avoid emotional persistence \u2014 repeating the same offer after rejection is inefficient.\n\n6. **Current Offer Evaluation (Incoming):**  \n   Player 1 offers: **5 Brick (5\u00d720 = 100)** and **3 Wood (3\u00d78 = 24)** \u2192 wants **8 Sheep (8\u00d713 = 104)**  \n   Net value to me: 124 in (5 Brick + 3 Wood), 104 out (8 Sheep) \u2192 **+20 value gain**  \n   This is a favorable trade: I gain more in total value, and the resources I give (Sheep, Wood) are relatively abundant.\n\n7. **Strategic Positioning**: After two successful trades of 4 Sheep + 3 Wood for 4 Brick, I now have likely reduced my Sheep and Wood slightly. But assuming I had surplus, the new offer from Player 1 improves on previous terms \u2014 instead of giving 4 Sheep for 4 Brick, now I can get 5 Brick + extra 3 Wood by giving 8 Sheep.\n\n8. **Decision Rule**: Accept offers where total value received > value given, especially when surplus resources are traded for high-value ones.\n\nApply Knowledge:  \nPlayer 1\u2019s offer: [5 Brick, 3 Wood \u2192 8 Sheep]  \n- I receive: 5 Brick (100) + 3 Wood (24) = 124 value  \n- I give: 8 Sheep (104) = 104 value  \n- Net gain: +20  \n- My Sheep and Wood are in surplus; Brick is high value.  \n\nThis trade increases my total portfolio value and aligns with optimal strategy.\n\n[Accept]",
