Value Density (marginal value per unit):\n   Wheat 5, Wood 6.5, Sheep ~0.82, Brick ~1.67, Ore ~2.13  \n   Lowest-density: Sheep (18/22 = 0.82).  \n   Highest-density: Ore (32/15 = 2.13).  \n   Therefore Sheep is the best outgoing surplus resource, Ore the best retained resource.\n\n2. Threshold Price Principle  \n   Any exchange must yield \u2265 its marginal value.  \n   Example: Giving up an Ore (32) \u2192 must receive \u226532 \u201cpoints\u201d back.\n\n3. Need to upgrade Brick\u2019s value for builds Castle/City  \n   Brick is only ~1.67, yet I already have 15.  One more Brick adds 25, but two more add only 24 (diminishing marginal utility shown in score-sheet), so Brick\u2019s marginal gain is dropping fast.\n\n4. Negotiation Insight: \u201cGive to Get\u201d  \n   I have the most Sheep (22), which is easiest to off-load.  \n   Brick is the most needed by others (high build utility), so demanding Brick in exchange for Sheep/Ore gives me asymmetric value.\n\n5.

      "response": "[Generate Knowledge]\n\nKey principles and strategies for resource trading and negotiation in this game:\n\n1. **Maximize Value Growth**: The goal is to increase the total value of your resources. Therefore, every trade should be evaluated based on whether it increases the total value of your holdings or positions you for future high-value trades.\n\n2. **Opportunity Cost and Marginal Value**: While a resource may have a fixed market value, its *marginal utility* depends on your current stock. For example, having 21 Sheep (valued at 17 each) means you likely have more than you currently need. Trading excess high-quantity, medium-value resources (like Sheep) for scarcer, high-value ones (like Brick or Ore) can be favorable.\n\n3. **Resource Scarcity and Leverage**: \n   - You have **16 Ore (value 38)** \u2014 highest individual value.\n   - You have **8 Brick (value 30)** \u2014 second highest.\n   - You have **21 Sheep (value 17)** \u2014 high quantity, lower per-unit value.\n   - Wheat and Wood are unused so far, but not requested.\n\n   Brick and Ore are your most valuable resources, so giving them away should yield strong returns.\n\n4. **Trade Efficiency**: Look for trades where the **total value received > total value given**. But also consider quantity and divisibility\u2014some trades may involve \"change\" in lower-value resources (e.g., Sheep) to balance.\n\n5. **Bundling and Change**: Sometimes, offers use lower-value items as \"change\" to balance trades. For example, requesting 1 Sheep back in a trade may indicate Player 0 is using Sheep as a medium.\n\n6. **Counterparty Behavior**: Player 0 is offering combinations of Sheep and Ore, requesting Brick and Sheep. This suggests:\n   - Player 0 may be trying to acquire Brick (value 30), which is scarce.\n   - They are using Sheep (value 17) and Ore (value 38) as currency.\n   - They are also requesting Sheep, possibly to balance trades or manipulate quantities.\n\n7. **Trend in Offers**:\n   - First offer: 3 Sheep + 2 Ore (value: 3\u00d717 + 2\u00d738 = 51 + 76 = 127) \u2192 5 Brick + 2 Sheep (value: 5\u00d730 + 2\u00d717 = 150 + 34 = 184)\n     - This would cost you 127 to gain 184 \u2014 good for you, but you rejected it (possibly because giving 5 Brick is too valuable).\n   - Second offer: 2 Sheep + 1 Ore (value: 2\u00d717 + 1\u00d738 = 34 + 38 = 72) \u2192 3 Brick + 1 Sheep (value: 3\u00d730 + 1\u00d717 = 90 + 17 = 107)\n     - Net gain: 107 - 72 = 35 value units.\n\n   From Player 0's shifting offers (reducing demand from 5 to 3 Brick), they may be negotiating down, indicating willingness to accept less.\n\n8. **Strategic Positioning**: Since Brick is high-value and you have only 8, giving away 3 is significant. But receiving Ore or Sheep in return can compensate if the net value increases.\n\n9. **Accepting vs. Making Offers**: To stay proactive, making a counter-offer can control the negotiation flow rather than just reacting.\n\n10. **Risk of No Trade**: With 10 turns total and only 2 passed, there\u2019s time, but repeated rejections may stall progress.\n\n[Apply Knowledge]\n\nEvaluate Player 0's current offer:\n- Offered to you: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore \u2192 total value received: 34 + 38 = 72\n- You give: 3 Brick, 1 Sheep \u2192 total value given: 90 + 17 = 107\n- **Net loss for you: 107 - 72 = 35 value units**\n\nThis trade **decreases** your total value. You are giving up high-value Brick (3\u00d730 = 90) for lower total value.\n\nEven though you gain 1 Ore (valuable), you're giving up 3 Brick and getting only 2 Sheep and 1 Ore in return \u2014 a net downgrade.\n\nMoreover, you already have 16 Ore (among your highest-value assets), while Brick is scarcer (only 8), so trading Brick for Ore may not be efficient.\n\nThus, **accepting this offer would reduce your total resource value** and goes against the objective.\n\nInstead, you should either:\n- Deny and make a **counter-offer** that increases your value.\n- Propose a trade where you give excess Sheep for high-value Ore or Brick.\n\nYou have 21 Sheep \u2014 among the highest quantity. You can use Sheep as trade leverage.\n\nIdeal counter-offer: Offer Sheep in exchange for Ore or Brick, with net positive value.\n\nExample: Offer 4 Sheep \u2192 Request 2 Ore.  \n- Value out: 4\u00d717 = 68  \n- Value in: 2\u00d738 = 76 \u2192 gain of 8\n\nOr: Offer 3 Sheep + 1 Brick \u2192 Request 1 Ore + 1 Brick (to recycle?) \u2014 but giving Brick is risky.\n\nBetter: Use Sheep surplus to gain Ore.\n\nBut Player 0 already has demonstrated willingness to trade Ore for Brick.\n\nSo reverse leverage: Offer Sheep to get Ore, without giving high-value assets.\n\nBut no direct request for Ore yet.\n\nAlternative: Make an offer that flips value in your favor.\n\nTry: Offer 4 Sheep \u2192 Request 3 Ore  \n- Cost: 68, Gain: 114 \u2192 too good, likely rejected.\n\nMore balanced: Offer 5 Sheep \u2192 Request 2 Ore  \n- Cost: 85, Gain: 76 \u2192 net loss? No.\n\nWait: 5\u00d717 = 85, 2\u00d738 = 76 \u2192 you lose value.\n\nSo even 5 Sheep for 2 Ore is bad *for you*.\n\nWait \u2014 **Ore is worth 38, Sheep 17**. So to trade Sheep for Ore, you need to give less value than you receive.\n\nSo: To get 1 Ore (38), you can give 2 Sheep (34) \u2014 net gain 4.\n\nThat\u2019s viable.\n\nSo: 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore: value gain 4.\n\nSimilarly, 5 Sheep \u2192 3 Ore: cost 85, gain 114 \u2192 +29.\n\nBut high ask.\n\nGiven that, a strong counter-offer can be:\n\n**[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**\n\nBut Player 0 may want Brick.\n\nTo align with their interest, consider:\n\nOffer: 4 Sheep + 1 Brick \u2192 Request: 2 Ore + 2 Sheep\n\nWait \u2014 circular.\n\nBetter: Offer: 3 Sheep, 1 Brick \u2192 Request: 2 Ore\n\n- You give: 3\u00d717 + 1\u00d730 = 51 + 30 = 81\n- You get: 2\u00d738 = 76 \u2192 net loss 5 \u2014 bad.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively: Offer: 1 Sheep, 1 Brick \u2192 Request: 1 Ore\n\n- Out: 17 + 30 = 47\n- In: 38 \u2192 loss.\n\nNo.\n\nSo best to avoid giving Brick or Ore if not gaining significantly.\n\nStick to surplus: Sheep.\n\nBest net-positive trades involve giving only Sheep in exchange for Ore.\n\nSo:\n\n**[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**\n\nNet: -34 +38 = +4 value.\n\nAcceptable.\n\nBut will it be accepted? Player 0 hasn\u2019t shown interest in taking Sheep without getting Brick.\n\nAlternatively, use a small Brick incentive.\n\nTry:\n\n**[Offer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Brick]**\n\n- Out: 51\n- In: 30 \u2192 loss 21 \u2014 bad.\n\nNo.\n\nReverse: **[Offer: 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep]**\n\n- Out: 30\n- In: 34 \u2192 gain 4\n\nBetter \u2014 increase value.\n\nYou give 1 Brick (30), get 2 Sheep (34) \u2014 net +4.\n\nYou have only 8 Brick, but if you\u2019re overstocked, okay.\n\nBut you may need Brick later.\n\nSince value goes up, worth considering.\n\nBut better to target Ore.\n\nAnother idea: **[Offer: 5 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**\n\n- Out: 85\n- In: 38 \u2192 huge loss \u2014 no.\n\nCannot trade more than 2 Sheep for 1 Ore to be value-positive.\n\nSo optimal: **[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]**\n\nValue gain: +4\n\nAlternatively, **[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]** \u2014 you gain 21, but unlikely to be accepted.\n\nPlayer 0 may view that as exploitative.\n\nBalance fairness and gain.\n\nGiven Player 0\u2019s previous offer (which would have lost you value), and their tendency to want Brick, consider a **Brick-neutral or Brick-targeted** counter that benefits you.\n\nWait \u2014 they want Brick, you have 8.\n\nYou can give 1 Brick if you get more value.\n\nTry: **[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]**\n\n- You gain: 30 - 17 = +13 \u2014 excellent\n\nBut unlikely accepted \u2014 giving 1 Brick for 1 Sheep is a loss for them.\n\nToo good for you.\n\n**[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]**\n\n- You gain: 30 - 34 = -4 \u2014 loss\n\nNo.\n\nSo giving Sheep for Brick is not value-positive unless ratio better than 2:1.\n\nBut 2 Sheep = 34 > 30 Brick \u2014 so even 2:1 loses you value.\n\nThus, **trading Sheep for Brick is inherently value-losing** unless you get extra.\n\nExample: 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick + 1 Wheat (but no info on Wheat use).\n\nBut no such resources offered.\n\nSimilarly, **Ore is the only resource worth more per unit than Sheep, so only Ore trade is net-positive in pure terms**.\n\nTherefore:\n\nBest value-increasing trades for you involve **giving Sheep to receive Ore**.\n\nAnd the exchange must be \u2264 2 Sheep per 1 Ore.\n\nSo:\n\n**[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]** is fair and gives you +4 value.\n\nMake this offer.\n\nDo not accept Player 0\u2019s current offer \u2014 it costs you value.\n\n[Deny] incoming offer.\n\nThen make your counter.\n\nBut system allows only one action per turn.\n\nYou must choose: [Accept], [Deny], or [Offer...]\n\nSince you are not accepting, default is [Deny], but you can make an [Offer] which implies rejection of the current one.\n\nBest: Make your own offer.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:  \n1. **Value Maximization Principle**: The core objective is to increase the total value of my resources. Therefore, every trade should aim to acquire higher-value resources or offload lower-value resources in exchange for those with higher individual value.  \n   - Current total value:  \n     (12 \u00d7 5) + (18 \u00d7 10) + (21 \u00d7 17) + (8 \u00d7 30) + (16 \u00d7 38) =  \n     60 + 180 + 357 + 240 + 608 = **1,445**\n\n2. **Resource Scarcity and Demand**: Brick and Ore have the highest individual values (30 and 38), suggesting they are highly valuable. I have limited Brick (8) and relatively high Ore (16), so trading excess Ore for Brick could be favorable if the exchange rate is beneficial.\n\n3. **Opportunity Cost and Marginal Value**: While Sheep are moderately valuable (17), I have a surplus (21). Offering Sheep to acquire higher-value resources like Brick or Ore improves portfolio value, especially if I can acquire more high-value units than I give up.\n\n4. **Trade Efficiency**: Successful trades should maximize value differential. For instance, giving a resource with lower value per unit to receive one with higher value per unit increases total value.\n\n5. **Negotiation Positioning**: Accepting or rejecting offers should reflect whether the trade improves my total resource value. Offering incremental trades (e.g., 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Ore) signals willingness to trade and may lead to larger deals.\n\n6. **Counteroffer Strategy**: After a rejected offer, propose a corrected trade that still benefits me but may be more palatable to the other player.\n\n7. **Turn Limitation (10 turns)**: Time is limited. Passive play risks missed opportunities. Proactive, value-positive offers are essential.\n\nApplication to Current Situation:  \n- After the accepted trade:  \n  - Gave: 3 Brick, 1 Sheep  \n  - Received: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore  \n  - Net: +1 Sheep, +1 Ore, -3 Brick  \n  - New counts:  \n    - Wheat: 12 (5)  \n    - Wood: 18 (10)  \n    - Sheep: 21 - 1 + 2 = 22 (17)  \n    - Brick: 8 - 3 = 5 (30)  \n    - Ore: 16 + 1 = 17 (38)  \n  - New total value:  \n    (12\u00d75) + (18\u00d710) + (22\u00d717) + (5\u00d730) + (17\u00d738) =  \n    60 + 180 + 374 + 150 + 646 = **1,410**  \n  - Slight decrease due to losing 3 Brick (worth 90) and gaining 1 Ore (38) and 1 Sheep (17) \u2192 net -35. But trade may have strategic purpose\u2014perhaps to conserve Brick or gain flexibility.\n\n- Then I offered 2 Sheep for 1 Ore \u2014 value given: 34, value received: 38 \u2192 small net gain of 4. But rejected.\n\nCurrent Strategy: I should attempt to trade surplus Sheep (22) for higher-value Brick or Ore. Since Brick is now low (5), acquiring more Brick would be valuable. Alternatively, turning excess Sheep into Ore (38) is highly beneficial if exchange rate is favorable.\n\nGiven Player 0 seems willing to trade Sheep and Ore for Brick, they may undervalue Brick or need it urgently. I should exploit this by offering Sheep for Brick at a rate where I gain net value.\n\nBest Offer: Trade Sheep (value 17) for Brick (30) \u2014 even 2 Sheep (34) for 2 Brick (60) is favorable for me? No \u2014 that would be a loss. Wait: 1 Sheep (17) for 1 Brick (30) would be +13 value. But Player 0 likely won\u2019t accept that.\n\nBut in prior accepted trade, Player 0 gave 2 Sheep + 1 Ore (17\u00d72 + 38 = 72) for 3 Brick + 1 Sheep (90 + 17 = 107). That\u2019s a loss for Player 0. So they may be overvaluing Brick.\n\nWait \u2014 correction:  \nPlayer 0 offered: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore \u2192 3 Brick, 1 Sheep  \nValue to Player 0: gives 2\u00d717 + 1\u00d738 = 34+38=72, receives 3\u00d730 +1\u00d717=90+17=107 \u2192 gains 35? That can\u2019t be \u2014 unless values are asymmetric? But the game uses fixed values.\n\nWait \u2014 no: Player 0 is giving 2 Sheep and 1 Ore, receiving 3 Brick and 1 Sheep. So net: +1 Sheep, -1 Ore, +3 Brick. Value impact: +17 -38 +90 = +69? That seems extremely favorable for Player 0. But I accepted it.\n\nDid I miscalculate?\n\nLet\u2019s re-express:  \nI (Player 1) accepted:  \n- I give: 3 Brick, 1 Sheep \u2192 value: 3\u00d730 + 1\u00d717 = 90 + 17 = 107  \n- I receive: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore \u2192 value: 2\u00d717 + 1\u00d738 = 34 + 38 = 72  \n\u2192 Net value change: 72 - 107 = -35 \u2192 I lost 35 in value.\n\nThat trade was unfavorable for me. Possibly due to poor judgment.\n\nSo now I must recover value. I have excess Sheep (22), low Brick (5), high Ore (17). Since Brick is valuable (30), and I have excess Sheep (17), I should seek to trade Sheep for Brick \u2014 but only if I receive more value than I give.\n\nExample: Giving 2 Sheep (34) for 2 Brick (60) \u2192 net +26 \u2192 good. But is that fair? 1 Sheep \u2248 17, 1 Brick = 30 \u2192 2 Sheep = 34 \u2248 1.13 Brick. So fair rate is ~2 Sheep for 1 Brick? That would be a 34\u219230 loss. No.\n\nActually, since 1 Brick = 30 > 1 Sheep = 17, one Brick is worth ~1.76 Sheep. So fair trade: 2 Sheep \u2248 1.76 \u2192 trade 2 Sheep for 1 Brick is only slightly worse for me (give 34, get 30). But if I can get 2 Sheep for 2 Brick (34\u219260), that\u2019s a huge win.\n\nBut such a trade would only be accepted if Player 0 undervalues Brick.\n\nAlternatively, Player 0 might want to accumulate Sheep. In their prior offer, they gave Sheep to get Brick \u2014 so they likely want Brick.\n\nThus, I should target trading my surplus Wheat (12) or Wood (18), which are low-value, for high-value Brick or Ore.\n\nWheat (5) and Wood (10) are my lowest-value resources. I have 12 Wheat and 18 Wood \u2014 excellent candidates to trade away.\n\nI neglected these earlier.\n\nWheat value 5, Wood 10 \u2014 both significantly below Sheep (17), Brick (30), Ore (38). So trading 2 Wheat (10) for 1 Sheep (17) is +7. Even better: 1 Wood (10) for 1 Brick (30) would be +20.\n\nBut must propose realistic offers.\n\nPlayer 0 has not shown interest in Wheat or Wood yet.\n\nBut I should initiate offers using low-value resources.\n\nFor example: Offer 5 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick (5\u00d75=25 given, 30 received \u2192 +5). Slight gain.\n\nOr 2 Wood \u2192 1 Ore (20 given, 38 received \u2192 +18) \u2014 very good if accepted.\n\nBut is that realistic? Player 0 may not accept a deal that gives them only 20 for 38.\n\nAlternatively, balance it: 3 Wood + 1 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore (3\u00d710 + 5 = 35 \u2192 38) \u2192 +3. Better.\n\nBut simpler: aim to trade low-value surplus (Wheat, Wood) for high-value (Brick, Ore).\n\nBest immediate move: Propose a value-positive, plausible offer using low-value resources.\n\nProposal: [Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Brick]  \n- I give: 40 value, receive: 30 \u2192 wait, no: 4 Wood = 4\u00d710=40, 1 Brick=30 \u2192 I lose 10. Bad.\n\nReverse: I want to receive Brick, give Wood.\n\nBut that means giving 40 to get 30 \u2014 worse.\n\nSo I must give multiple low-value for one high-value.\n\nExample: 4 Wheat \u2192 1 Sheep: 20 \u2192 17 \u2192 loss.\n\nWait: no \u2014 I need to receive high-value items.\n\nSo: 3 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Sheep: 15+10=25 \u2192 17 \u2192 still loss.\n\nBut 2 Sheep \u2192 1 Brick: 34 \u2192 30 \u2192 loss.\n\nWait \u2014 no resource has value less than 5. So to get 1 Ore (38), I need to give at least 8 Wheat (40) \u2014 too high.\n\nBut 1 Ore (38) vs 7 Wheat (35) \u2192 7 Wheat \u2192 1 Ore: 35\u219238 \u2192 +3. Good.\n\nSimilarly, 1 Brick (30) \u2248 6 Wheat (30) \u2014 break even.\n\nBut I can do better by combining.\n\nAlternatively, exploit Player 0\u2019s behavior: they accepted gaining 1 Sheep and 3 Brick for giving 2 Sheep and 1 Ore \u2014 wait no, confusion.\n\nLet\u2019s recheck trade history:\n\nPlayer 0 offered: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore \u2192 3 Brick, 1 Sheep  \nI accepted \u2192 So I gave 3 Brick and 1 Sheep, received 2 Sheep and 1 Ore.\n\nSo Player 0 received: 3 Brick, 1 Sheep  \nGave: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore  \nSo net: -1 Ore, -1 Sheep, +3 Brick\n\nFor Player 0: lost 38 + 17 = 55, gained 90 + 17 = 107 \u2192 +52? That can\u2019t be \u2014 unless I messed.\n\nNo: the *offer* is what Player 0 offers to give, for what they want to receive.\n\nStandard notation: [Offered: A -> B] means: Player gives A, wants B.\n\nBut in the text: \"Offered items: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore -> Requested items: 3 Brick, 1 Sheep\"\n\nSo Player 0 offers to give: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore  \nAnd requests: 3 Brick, 1 Sheep\n\nSo if accepted, Player 0 gives 2S + 1O, receives 3B + 1S\n\nNet: +1S, +3B, -1O\n\nValue change: +17 +90 -38 = +69 \u2014 hugely positive.\n\nBut I (Player 1) give 3B + 1S (90+17=107), receive 2S + 1O (34+38=72), so I lose 35 value.\n\nI made a mistake accepting that trade.\n\nTo recover, I must now make value-positive trades.\n\nBest path: use my surplus low-value resources to acquire high-value ones.\n\nWheat: 5, Wood:10 \u2014 both below average value? But I have 12 Wheat and 18 Wood.\n\nNote: Sheep is 17, but I have 22 \u2014 still surplus.\n\nSo offer a combination of low-value items for high-value.\n\nFor example: Offer 5 Wheat + 1 Wood \u2192 1 Ore  \nValue: give 25 + 10 = 35, receive 38 \u2192 net +3 for me.\n\nOr 6 Wheat \u2192 1 Brick: 30\u219230 \u2192 break even, but gains diversity.\n\nBut better: give a mix they might want.\n\nSince they gave Ore before, maybe they are low on Ore now.\n\nAlternatively, offer a fair trade to build trust.\n\nNew strategy: Use excess Wheat and Wood to trade for Brick or Ore.\n\nBest offer: [Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]  \nValue I give: 5\u00d75 + 1\u00d710 = 25+10=35  \nValue I receive: 38  \nNet gain: +3\n\nAlternatively, to increase chance of acceptance, make it fair: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore (35\u219238), same.\n\nOr 3 Wood -> 1 Brick + 1 Sheep: give 30, receive 30+17=47 \u2192 +17, too good to be true.\n\nBut perhaps worth trying.\n\nBut better to be realistic.\n\nSince Player 0 did not respond to my last offer (2 Sheep -> 1 Ore), which was fair (+1 value for me: give 34, get 38), they may be strategic.\n\nSo now, I\u2019ll propose a new offer using low-value resources.\n\nFinal Decision: Propose a value-positive, reasonable trade.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]  \nValue given: 30 + 10 = 40, received: 30 \u2192 loss? No.\n\n6 Wheat = 30, 1 Wood=10 \u2192 40, get 30 \u2192 loss. Bad.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore] = 30 \u2192 38 \u2192 +8? Good, but may be rejected.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore] = 40 + 10 = 50 \u2192 38 \u2192 loss.\n\nNo.\n\nMust give less value than I receive.\n\nSo: [Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore] = 35 \u2192 38 \u2192 +3\n\nOr [Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick] = 30\u219230 \u2192 neutral\n\nOr [Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick] = 25 + 17 = 42 \u2192 60 \u2192 +18? Only if they accept.\n\nBut 1 Sheep is 17 \u2014 bit high.\n\nBetter: [Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep] = 40 \u2192 30+17=47 \u2192 +7\n\nYes.\n\nBut perhaps simpler: target Ore.\n\nAfter analysis, best reasonable and positive trade:\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore]  \n- I give: 7 Wheat (7\u00d75=35)  \n- Receive: 1 Ore (38)  \n- Net gain: +3\n\nValue-maximizing and plausible.\n\nIf Player 0 has surplus Wheat, they might accept.\n\nSo I make that offer.\n\n[Offer: 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "**Generate Knowledge:**\n\nIn resource-based negotiation games like this, the goal is to maximize the total value of your inventory through strategic trading. Key principles and insights include:\n\n1. **Value Asymmetry Drives Trade**: Trade is beneficial when each party values what they receive more than what they give. Understanding relative scarcity, utility, and personal valuation helps identify profitable trades.\n\n2. **Resource Valuation**: Based on the given values:\n   - Wheat: 5\n   - Wood: 10\n   - Sheep: 17\n   - Brick: 30\n   - Ore: 38  \n   High-value resources (Brick, Ore) are more impactful. Since Brick is worth 30 and Ore 38, they are most valuable. Sheep (17) has moderate value, Wood (10) is lower, and Wheat (5) is lowest.\n\n3. **Opportunity Cost & Scarcity**: You have plenty of Sheep (21) and Wood (18), so offering them in trade carries lower opportunity cost. Conversely, Ore (16) and Brick (8) are high-value and limited\u2014losing too much risks future gains.\n\n4. **Trade Efficiency**: Focus on gaining high-value resources (especially Brick and Ore) in exchange for lower or moderately valuable ones (like Wood or excess Sheep). Avoid trades that give high value for low return.\n\n5. **Incremental Gains**: Even small favorable trades accumulate. A consistent strategy of trading low-value surplus for high-value scarcity can compound over 10 turns.\n\n6. **Offer Framing**: Offers should appear fair or slightly favorable to the other player to increase acceptance, while still benefiting you. Overreaching may lead to rejection.\n\n7. **Track Inventory Changes**: After previous trades:\n   - You **accepted**: 2 Sheep, 1 Ore \u2192 gave 3 Brick, 1 Sheep  \n     Net: +1 Sheep, +1 Ore, -3 Brick  \n     New totals:  \n     - Sheep: 21 +1 = 22  \n     - Ore: 16 +1 = 17  \n     - Brick: 8 -3 = 5  \n     Also previously you gave 2 Sheep for 1 Ore (rejected), and 4 Wood for 1 Brick (rejected).\n\n8. **Current Inventory**:  \n   - Wheat: 12 (val: 5)  \n   - Wood: 18 (val: 10)  \n   - Sheep: 22 (val: 17)  \n   - Brick: 5 (val: 30) \u2192 scarce but valuable  \n   - Ore: 17 (val: 38)  \n\n   Brick is now very low (5 left). Since it\u2019s highly valuable, replenishing it efficiently is a priority.\n\n9. **Latest Offer from Player 0**: 5 Wood + 1 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick  \n   Evaluate:  \n   - You give: 5 Wood (5\u00d710 = 50), 1 Sheep (17) \u2192 total value given: 67  \n   - You receive: 3 Brick (3\u00d730 = 90)  \n   - Net value gain: +23 \u2014 **favorable trade**.\n\nThis offer significantly increases your total resource value. Even though you're giving up 6 Wood and 1 Sheep (which you have in surplus), you gain 3 high-value Bricks.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince this offer improves your total value and Brick is scarce, and you have surplus Wood and Sheep, it\u2019s rational to accept.\n\n[Accept]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1. Value-to-quantity ratios  \n   - Brick gives 25 value per brick, so each 1 Brick is worth 25 net-value.  \n   - Ore gives 32 value per ore.  \n   - Sheep gives 18 value per sheep.  \n   - Wood gives 11 value per wood.  \n   - Wheat gives 5 value per wheat.\n\n   These ratios tell me which resources to hoard (Ore, Brick) and which to export cheaply (Wheat, Wood).  \n\n2. End-game target: total value growth.  \n   Since the game ends abruptly after 10 turns, any resource not yet traded loses its flexibility; the safest gains are realized by converting everything into Ore + Brick while still keeping a balanced set to avoid penalties.  \n\n3. Negotiation leverage.  \n   - I already executed two good trades that netted me +4 Bricks for only +2 lost metals and cheap Wood/Sheep.  \n   - Player 1 repeatedly asks for Ore (high-value) while giving away low-value Wood/Sheep.  \n   - Ignore future offers that give away Ore, Brick, or high-value combinations.  \n   - Focus on offers that exclusively move Wood, Wheat, or Sheep into Brick/Ore.\n\n4. Stock positioning after Turn 10.  \n   Current inventory (after the last accepted offer gives me net +3 Brick, \u20115 Wood, \u20111 Sheep) is approximately:  \n   Wheat 9 (45), Wood 12 (132), Sheep 21 (378), Brick 19 (475), Ore 13 (416).  \n   Total value \u2248 1 446.  \n\n   Goal: push final valuation a bit higher by squeezing an additional low-value \u2192 high-value exchange before the game closes.\n\n5. Feasible last-minute export.  \n   The only resource I hold in abundance that is low-value is Wood (12). Any trade peeling off surplus Wood or Sheep for Brick or Ore yields a higher value. A two-Wood for one-Brick deal delivers +3 net value.\n\nApply the knowledge: I need one last positive-yield trade before the clock expires.

      "response": "Generate Knowledge: Key principles for optimal resource trading in this context include:  \n1. **Value-Based Trading**: Always ensure trades yield *net positive value* (received value > given value) using fixed resource values. Brick (30) and Ore (38) are high-value targets; trade surplus Wheat (5), Wood (10), or Sheep (17) to acquire them.  \n2. **Scarcity Leverage**: Player 0 consistently seeks Brick (requested in 3/4 offers), indicating high demand. Exploit this by requesting >30 value per Brick (e.g., 4 Wood = 40).  \n3. **Loss Aversion**: Rejected offers (e.g., Player 0\u2019s 25-value-for-30-Brick) reveal Player 0\u2019s willingness to overpay. Counter with *minimal profitable terms* (e.g., 4 Wood per Brick) to balance acceptance likelihood and value gain.  \n4. **Resource Opportunity Cost**: Prioritize trades converting low-value density resources (Wheat/Wood) into high-value ones (Brick/Ore). Trading 1 Brick for 4 Wood yields +10 value\u2014optimal given current Wood surplus (18).  \n5. **Zero-Sum Reality**: With symmetric values, mutually beneficial trades are impossible. Target *asymmetric desperation* (e.g., Player 0\u2019s Brick dependency) to secure small losses for them (e.g., 40-for-30) as gains for you.  \n\nApply Knowledge: Player 0\u2019s offer (2 Wood + 1 Wheat = 25 value) for 1 Brick (30) causes a -5 value loss\u2014**reject**. Counter with [Offer: 1 Brick -> 4 Wood] to exploit Player 0\u2019s demand:  \n- You gain 10 value (receive 40 Wood, lose 30 Brick).  \n- Player 0 accepts marginal loss (they previously offered 25 for 30), as critical for Brick needs.  \nThis maximizes value increase while leveraging negotiation asymmetry.  \n\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 4 Wood]",
