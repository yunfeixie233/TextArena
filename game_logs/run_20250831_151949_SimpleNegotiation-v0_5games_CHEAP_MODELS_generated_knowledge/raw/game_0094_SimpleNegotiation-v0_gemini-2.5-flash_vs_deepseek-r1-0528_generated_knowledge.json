      "response": "## Generate Knowledge:\n\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This is paramount. Every trade must be evaluated based on whether it directly contributes to this goal.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** Each resource has a distinct value. My current inventory value is important, and I should aim to increase it.\n    *   Wheat: 6\n    *   Wood: 9\n    *   Sheep: 17\n    *   Brick: 24\n    *   Ore: 35\n3.  **Identify High-Value Resources (to acquire):** Ore, Brick, Sheep. These are the most efficient ways to increase total value.\n4.  **Identify Low-Value Resources (to offer):** Wheat, Wood. These are the ideal resources to give away, especially if I have them in abundance.\n5.  **Quantity vs. Value:** While value is key, quantity plays a role in what I *can* offer. I have a lot of Wheat and Wood. I have a decent amount of Brick and Ore. My Sheep quantity is relatively low given its high value.\n6.  **Optimal Trade Ratios:** Aim to give away low-value resources for high-value resources. The ideal ratio is offering resources whose *total value* is less than the *total value* of the resources I receive. For example, trading 2 Wheat (12 value) for 1 Ore (35 value) is excellent.\n7.  **Avoid Sub-Optimal Trades:** Do not trade high-value resources for low-value resources unless absolutely necessary (e.g., to gain a critical resource for an immediate very high-value play outside the scope of this turn).\n8.  **Strategic Surplus:** I have significant quantities of Wheat (19) and Wood (21). These are good candidates for trading large amounts to acquire more valuable resources. I can afford to part with them.\n9.  **Scarcity and Demand (implied):** While I don't know the other player's inventory, typically players value resources they lack. Offering relatively abundant, low-value resources for relatively scarcer, high-value resources is a good strategy.\n10. **Negotiation Leverage:** My large quantities of Wheat and Wood give me flexibility. I can offer diverse combinations.\n11. **Proactiveness:** As Player 0, I initiate the first offer. This allows me to set the terms and test the waters.\n12. **Simplicity (Initial Offer):** Keeping the first offer relatively straightforward can be more effective than complex multi-resource trades.\n\n## Trading Decision:\n\nMy goal is to increase my total value. My most abundant low-value resources are Wheat and Wood. My highest-value resources are Ore and Brick. Sheep is also valuable but I have fewer of them.\n\nI will formulate an offer that gives away plentiful low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) in exchange for valuable resources (Brick, Ore).\n\n**Current Strategy:** Offer combinations of Wheat and Wood to acquire Brick or Ore. I have 19 Wheat (val 6) and 21 Wood (val 9).\n\nLet's look at some options:\n*   2 Wood (18) for 1 Brick (24) - Good.\n*   3 Wood (27) for 1 Ore (35) - Good.\n*   3 Wheat (18) for 1 Brick (24) - Good.\n*   4 Wheat (24) for 1 Brick (24) - Even.\n*   5 Wood (45) for 1 Ore (35) + 1 Brick (24) = 59 - Good in principle, but large offer.\n*   2 Wood (18) + 1 Wheat (6) = 24 for 1 Brick (24) - Even.\n*   3 Wood (27) + 1 Wheat (6) = 33 for 1 Ore (35) - Decent.\n\nI want to make an offer that is clearly beneficial to me but also potentially attractive to the other player. I have a large surplus of Wheat and Wood. I also have plenty of Brick and Ore, but they are high-value so I'm aiming to acquire *more*.\n\nLet's try to trade Wood and Wheat for Ore or Brick.\n\nTarget: Get Ore (Value 35) or Brick (Value 24).\nOffer: Wheat (Value 6) or Wood (Value 9).\n\nConsider offering a larger quantity of low-value resources for a high-value one.\nI have 21 Wood. Offering 3 Wood for 1 Ore makes sense value-wise (27 for 35). This is beneficial to me.\nWhat about offering a mix?\n2 Wood (18) + 2 Wheat (12) = 30 value for 1 Ore (35) - This is a good value gain.\n\nLet's simplify. Offer multiple low-value items for one high-value item.\n\n**My first offer will be:** Offer a generous amount of low-value resources (Wood, Wheat) for a single high-value resource (Ore).\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: (2 * 9) + (4 * 6) = 18 + 24 = 42\nValue requested: 1 * 35 = 35\n\nWait, this offer gives away more value than I get (42 for 35). This is *not* what I want to do. I need to gain value.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. I need \"Value Offered < Value Requested\".\n\nOption 1: [Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 3 * 9 = 27\nValue requested: 1 * 35 = 35\n**This increases my value by 8.** This is a strong positive trade for me. I can afford to part with 3 Wood (out of 21).\n\nOption 2: [Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nValue offered: (2 * 9) + (1 * 6) = 18 + 6 = 24\nValue requested: 1 * 24 = 24\nThis is an even trade. It doesn't increase my *total* value. I want to *increase* my value.\n\nOption 3: [Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nValue offered: 3 * 6 = 18\nValue requested: 1 * 24 = 24\n**This increases my value by 6.** This is also good.\n\nGiven my abundance, I think targeting Ore with Wood is a good first step. It's concise and offers a clear benefit to me if accepted. It also implies the other player might value Wood.\n\nFinal check on the chosen offer:\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\nMy current Wood: 21. After trade: 18. Still plenty.\nMy current Ore: 16. After trade: 17. Good.\nValue change: +35 (Ore) - 27 (Wood) = +8 Value. This meets my objective.\n\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge on Resource Trading and Negotiation\n1. **Value Optimization Principle**: Prioritize trades where received resources' total value exceeds the given resources. Maximizing net gain per trade directly increases overall portfolio value.\n2. **Resource Valuation Strategy**:  \n   - High-value resources (e.g., Ore @ 37, Brick @ 30) are growth accelerators; trade them sparingly unless receiving disproportionately high returns.  \n   - Low-value surplus resources (e.g., Wood @ 9, Wheat @ 6) are ideal for trading away to acquire rarer/higher-value goods.  \n3. **Liquidity Awareness**: \n   - Large stockpiles of low-value resources (23 Wood/Sheep) create negotiation leverage\u2014use them to offload excess while targeting Brick/Ore.  \n   - Focus trades on converting low-impact resources (Wheat/Wood) into Brick, which holds high value (30) but moderate scarcity (13 units).  \n4. **Strategic Rejection Criteria**: Reject offers where high-value resources are undervalued or low-value resources are overpaid. Always verify net value change.  \n5. **Counteroffer Opportunity**: If an offer has marginal benefit, propose a revised trade favoring your value gaps (e.g., trading surplus Sheep/Wood for Brick).  \n\n### Trading Decision  \n**Offer Analysis**:  \n- Player 0 offers: **+2 Wood (9 \u00d7 2 = 18 value), +4 Wheat (6 \u00d7 4 = 24 value)** \u2192 Total received value: **42**  \n- Player 0 requests: **-1 Ore (37 \u00d7 1 = 37 value)**  \n- **Net value impact**: +42 - 37 = **+5 gain**  \n\n**Decision Rationale**:  \n- Accepting yields a **modest net gain (+5)**. Ore remains abundant (22 \u2192 21 units), and the acquired Wood/Wheat minimally impact our surplus.  \n- However, Ore is our highest-value resource. Rational negotiation requires weighting gains against opportunity cost: better Ore deals may emerge later.  \n- Strategic priority is acquiring **Brick (value 30)**. A marginally positive Wood/Wheat trade doesn't align with optimizing resource hierarchy.  \n\n**Action**: **[Deny]**  \n*Strategic note: Counter with an offer redirecting surplus Wood/Sheep toward Brick acquisition next turn.*",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Calculate Current Value:** Determine the total value of my current resources to establish a baseline. This allows me to objectively assess whether a trade increases my total wealth.\n    *   Wheat: 19 * 6 = 114\n    *   Wood: 21 * 9 = 189\n    *   Sheep: 8 * 17 = 136\n    *   Brick: 17 * 24 = 408\n    *   Ore: 16 * 35 = 560\n    *   Total Current Value = 114 + 189 + 136 + 408 + 560 = 1407\n\n2.  **Identify Resource Abundance and Scarcity:** I have a good quantity of Wheat and Wood, and decent quantities of Brick and Ore. Sheep is my scarcest resource. High quantities of low-value items can be traded for higher-value items.\n\n3.  **Prioritize High-Value Resources:** Ore (35) and Brick (24) are my most valuable resources. Sheep (17) is next, followed by Wood (9) and Wheat (6). My goal is to accumulate more high-value resources or trade low-value resources for a net gain.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Trade Ratios:** A good trade means the value of resources received is greater than the value of resources given. For example, trading 2 Wood (18) + 4 Wheat (24) = 42 for 1 Ore (35) is a *loss* of 7 value. This tells me my previous offer was not optimal and was likely rejected because it was unfavorable to Player 1 (or at best, unprofitable for me). I should aim for offers where I receive significantly more value than I give, especially when trading abundant low-value resources for scarce high-value ones.\n\n5.  **Understanding Player 1's Perspective (Implicit):** Player 1 rejected my previous offer. This indicates they either didn't need the resources I offered, or more likely, they found the trade unfavorable from their perspective (or beneficial enough for them, if my offer was good, they would have probably accepted). I need to make offers that are *mutually beneficial* or at least *appear* to be. Player 1 likely also wants to increase their total resource value.\n\n6.  **Strategic Resource Management:** I have a significant amount of Wheat and Wood. These are prime candidates for trading, especially if I can consolidate them into fewer, higher-value resources. I have a good amount of Ore and Brick already, but more is always better if the trade is favorable. Sheep is limited but valuable, so I should be careful not to trade it away cheaply.\n\n7.  **Consider Player 1's Needs (Conjecture):** Since I don't know Player 1's inventory, I should make offers that balance my benefit with a reasonable appeal to them. Offering high quantities of low-value resources for a small amount of high-value resources is a standard strategy.\n\n8.  **Learning from Rejection:** The previous rejection (2 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore) indicated my offer was insufficient. The value offered was 2*9 + 4*6 = 18 + 24 = 42. The value requested was 1*35 = 35. This trade was a *loss* for me, so it was a very poor offer. My goal should be to turn this around. I should offer low-value resources for higher-value ones, ensuring I get more value than I give.\n\n9.  **Formulating New Offers:**\n    *   I need to get *more* value than I give.\n    *   Target high-value resources (Ore, Brick, Sheep) from Player 1.\n    *   Offer my abundant low-value resources (Wheat, Wood).\n    *   Example: Target Ore (value 35). What would I offer for 1 Ore? 3 Wood (27) + 2 Wheat (12) = 39. This is a very slightly beneficial trade for me, offering 39 value for 35 value received. Player 1 might accept if they need Wood/Wheat.\n    *   Another idea: Trade a larger quantity of low-value resources for fewer high-value resources. I have 19 Wheat and 21 Wood.\n    *   My previous value *loss* in the offer (42 for 35) means I was essentially giving away 7 value. I need to reverse this.\n    *   Let's aim for a net gain of at least 10-20 value per trade, if possible, especially when trading low-value for high-value items.\n    *   Consider offering 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Brick (24). This is a loss for me.\n    *   Consider offering 5 Wood (45) + 3 Wheat (18) = 63 for 2 Ore (70). This is a reasonable offer that is slightly better for Player 1 (70 for 63), which might be beneficial for acceptance. But I want to gain value.\n    *   I have plenty of Wood and Wheat. Let's try to get Ore which is high value.\n    *   To get 1 Ore (35 value), I could offer 3 Wood (27) and 2 Wheat (12) = 39 value. I lose 4 value, which is not good.\n    *   I want to gain value. The simplest way is to give away many low-value items for one high-value item.\n    *   Let's try to trade 3 Wood for 1 Sheep (value 17). 3 Wood = 27 value. I'm overspending.\n    *   What if I offer 1 Brick (24) and want 1 Ore (35)? That's a good gain for me, but maybe too much for Player 1.\n    *   Okay, let's make an offer where I clearly gain value.\n    *   I have an abundance of Wheat and Wood.\n    *   Offer: 4 Wood (36 value) + 3 Wheat (18 value) = 54 value.\n    *   Request: 2 Ore (70 value).\n    *   This is a net gain of 16 value for me (70-54). Player 1 receives 54 value resources for 70 value resources, which is a loss for them. This might be rejected.\n\n    *   I need to make an offer that is *attractive enough* for Player 1 to accept, while still netting me a gain.\n    *   Let's reconsider the ratio. I want to trade low for high.\n    *   My goal is to increase overall value.\n    *   Current total value: 1407.\n\n    *   New strategy: Trade cheap abundant resources for more valuable ones, aiming for a favorable value exchange.\n    *   Resources I have plenty of: Wheat (19), Wood (21).\n    *   Resources I want more of, or can consolidate to: Ore (35), Brick (24), Sheep (17).\n\n    *   Offer 5 Wheat (~30 value) for 1 Sheep (17 value) - bad\n    *   Offer 3 Wood (~27 value) for 1 Sheep (17 value) - bad\n\n    *   Let's try to get Brick or Ore.\n    *   If I offer 7 Wheat (42) for 1 Ore (35), I lose value.\n    *   If I offer 5 Wood (45) for 1 Ore (35), I lose value.\n\n    *   My previous offer was bad. 2 Wood (18) + 4 Wheat (24) = 42 for 1 Ore (35). I lost 7 value.\n    *   I must flip this. I need to *receive* more value than I *give*.\n\n    *   Let's try:\n        *   Give: 3 Wood (27)\n        *   Receive: 1 Sheep (17 value) + some Wheat? No, I want to trade Wood/Wheat away.\n\n    *   Okay, clear focus: Trade Wheat/Wood for Ore/Brick/Sheep, ensuring the value received > value given.\n    *   What if I aim for a small, but positive gain?\n    *   Offer 4 Wood (36 value) for 1 Ore (35 value). I lose 1 value here. Not good.\n    *   Offer 2 Wood (18) + 3 Wheat (18) = 36 value. Request 1 Ore (35). Still losing.\n\n    *   This implies my previous logic for evaluating the trade was incorrect or my previous offer (2W, 4W -> 1O) was truly terrible.\n    *   Calculation for 2 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore: Given (2*9 + 4*6) = 18 + 24 = 42. Received (1*35) = 35. Value change = 35 - 42 = -7. Yes, it was bad.\n\n    *   New, better approach:\n        *   Identify my cheapest resources: Wheat (6), Wood (9).\n        *   Identify desired resources: Ore (35), Brick (24), Sheep (17).\n        *   Set a target value to receive. Let's aim for 1 Ore (35).\n        *   What is the maximum quantity of my cheap goods I can offer to get this, while still making a profit?\n        *   Example: Target gain of 5. So I offer items worth 30 for 1 Ore (35).\n        *   30 value = 5 Wheat. Is 5 Wheat for 1 Ore reasonable? It's a huge gain for me. Likely rejected.\n        *   30 value = 3 Wood + 2 Wheat (27+12=39 value - nope, too much)\n        *   30 value = 3 Wood + 1 Wheat (27+6=33 value). Offer 3 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore.\n            *   Value given: 3*9 + 1*6 = 27 + 6 = 33.\n            *   Value received: 1*35 = 35.\n            *   Net gain = +2. This is a positive gain for me. Player 1 gives 35 value for 33 value. A slight loss for them, but maybe acceptable if they need Wood/Wheat.\n            *   I have 21 Wood and 19 Wheat. I can afford this.\n\n    *   What about other options?\n    *   Target gain of 10. Offer value 25 for 1 Ore (35).\n        *   25 value = 4 Wood (36 - too much)\n        *   25 value = 4 Wheat (24). Offer 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore. Large gain for me. Potentially rejected.\n\n    *   Given the previous rejection, Player 1 isn't desperate. I should make an offer that is *slightly* favorable to me but not outrageously so, and somewhat appealing to them.\n    *   The 3 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore (33 -> 35 value) trade results in a +2 value for me. This is small but positive.\n\n    *   Consider a trade involving Sheep (17).\n    *   Offer 3 Wheat (18) for 1 Sheep (17). This is a loss of 1 for me. Bad.\n    *   Offer 2 Wood (18) for 1 Sheep (17). Loss of 1 for me. Bad.\n\n    *   The marginal gains on simple trades are tough if I'm always trying to profit substantially while Player 1 is also trying to profit.\n    *   Let's aim for a modest gain in value.\n    *   Let's focus on offloading Wheat and Wood.\n    *   Total Wheat: 19 (114 value)\n    *   Total Wood: 21 (189 value)\n\n    *   How about a trade for Brick (24)?\n    *   Offer 3 Wood (27) for 1 Brick (24). Lose 3.\n    *   Offer 4 Wheat (24) for 1 Brick (24). Break even. No direct gain.\n    *   Offer 3 Wheat (18) for 1 Brick (24). Gain 6 - good for me, bad for P1. Likely rejected.\n    *   Offer 2 Wood (18) for 1 Brick (24). Gain 6 - good for me, bad for P1. Likely rejected.\n\n    *   Let's try to get more Sheep, as I have less of it.\n    *   Offer 2 Wood (18) for 1 Sheep (17). Loss of 1.\n    *   Offer 3 Wheat (18) for 1 Sheep (17). Loss of 1.\n\n    *   The previous offer rejection suggests Player 1 either needs a better deal or doesn't need Wheat/Wood that badly.\n    *   I need to be slightly more aggressive in requesting high-value items for my low-value items.\n    *   Scenario: Trade a lot of cheap stuff for one valuable item.\n    *   Offer: 7 Wheat (42)\n    *   Request: 1 Ore (35 value). I lose 7. Why am I struggling to profit while trading my cheap resources for valuable ones?\n\n    *   My assumption: Trading cheap resources *for* expensive resources should net me value.\n    *   If I offer (X quantity of Wheat/Wood) -> (1 Ore).\n    *   If X quantity of Wheat Value > 1 Ore Value, I lose.\n    *   If X quantity of Wheat Value < 1 Ore Value, I gain.\n\n    *   I should offer minimal value for maximum return.\n    *   How about 3 Wood (27) for 1 Brick (24)? Loss.\n    *   How about 4 Wheat (24) for 1 Brick (24)? Net 0.\n    *   How about 2 Wood (18) for 1 Brick (24)? Gain 6. This is a potential offer. I give 18 value, get 24 value. Player 1 gives 24 value, gets 18 value. This is a -6 for them. Will they accept?\n\n    *   Let's try it. I have 21 Wood. Giving 2 is fine. Gaining Brick is good.\n    *   [Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick] Value: Give 18, Receive 24. Net gain: 6.\n    *   This is a good offer for me. It's a noticeable loss for Player 1, but if they desperately need Wood, they might take it. My previous offer was a net loss *for me*, so that's why it was bad. I need to make sure I am gaining value.\n\n    *   Let's also look at getting Sheep.\n    *   [Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Sheep]? Value: Give 18, Receive 17. Net gain: -1. Bad.\n    *   [Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]? Value: Give 18, Receive 17. Net gain: -1. Bad.\n\n    *   So, 2 Wood -> 1 Brick is the best value proposition for me that seems remotely plausible for Player 1.\n    *   My initial rejection shows that Player 1 is not accepting negative value trades for themselves, so I need to make it neutral or slightly positive for both if I want high acceptance. But my goal is to increase my own value.\n\n    *   Let's ensure I'm not overvaluing my position. I am Player 0. I need to make a profitable trade.\n    *   The previous offer (2W, 4W -> 1O) was 42 value for 35 value, a -7 loss for me, so it was a very bad offer FOR ME.\n\n    *   My current proposal: [Offer: 2 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n        *   Player 0: Give 2 Wood (18 value), Receive 1 Brick (24 value). Net gain: +6.\n        *   Player 1: Give 1 Brick (24 value), Receive 2 Wood (18 value). Net loss: -6.\n        *   Will Player 1 accept a -6 value trade? Unlikely, unless they are desperate for Wood.\n\n    *   I need to make the offer more palatable, perhaps closer to break-even for both, with a slight edge for me.\n    *   Consider this: Give 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (35).\n        *   Player 0: Give 5 Wheat (30 value), Receive 1 Ore (35 value). Net gain: +5.\n        *   Player 1: Give 1 Ore (35 value), Receive 5 Wheat (30 value). Net loss: -5.\n        *   This is very similar to the previous.\n\n    *   What trade would be neutral or slightly positive for Player 1, while still positive for me?\n    *   The total value of my inventory is 1407. I NEED to increase this.\n    *   Let's try to trade Brick for Ore, since I have a good amount of Brick.\n    *   [Offer: 1 Brick -> 1 Ore]? Value: Give 24, Receive 35. Gain 11. Huge gain for me. Unlikely.\n\n    *   I need to utilize my abundant low-value resources.\n    *   Focus on small, consistent gains.\n    *   If I offer 3 Wood (27) for 1 Sheep (17), that's a loss.\n    *   What if I trade 1 Wood and 1 Wheat -> some other resource?\n        *   1 Wood (9) + 1 Wheat (6) = 15. Can I get anything for 15? No single resource.\n\n    *   Given the prior rejection, a significant loss for Player 1 seems unlikely to pass.\n    *   I should aim for a trade where I exchange resources that are low value for me for resources that are high value for me, but the *actual value exchange* for Player 1 is relatively neutral or even slightly positive. This requires knowing Player 1's needs, which I don't.\n\n    *   Simplest strategy: Offer many of my abundant cheap resources for one of their valuable resources.\n    *   Offer 5 Wood (45) for 1 Ore (35). I lose 10. This is what I keep getting wrong. I must be getting confused.\n    *   My goal: Receive > Give.\n\n    *   Let's re-evaluate:\n        *   If I offer 2 Wood and 4 Wheat (42 value) for 1 Ore (35 value), I (Player 0) *gave away* more value than I received. This is a negative trade for me, by -7. This is why Player 1 rejected it. It was probably a negative trade for Player 1 too.\n\n    *   I need to construct an offer where *I receive more value than I give*.\n        *   Offer 1 Wood (9) and 1 Wheat (6) = 15 Value.\n        *   If I were to get 1 Sheep (17) in return. Value (17) - Cost (15) = +2. This is a positive trade for me.\n        *   Player 1 gives 17 value, receives 15 value. Net loss of 2. This is much more plausible for Player 1.\n        *   I have 21 Wood and 19 Wheat, so giving 1 of each is fine.\n        *   I have 8 Sheep, so gaining more is good.\n\n    *   This looks like a good candidate. It's a small gain for me, a small loss for Player 1, which might be acceptable if they need Wood/Wheat or want to diversify their assets.\n\nDecision:\n[Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]",

Trades should have a net positive value gain: the requested resources must yield higher value than what I offer.  \n   - **Current valuation per unit**:  \n     - Wheat: 6, Wood: 9, Sheep: 12 (low-value)  \n     - Brick: 30, Ore: 37 (high-value)  \n   - Avoid trades with **net value loss** (e.g., trading Brick for lower-value resources).\n\n2. **Resource Prioritization**:  \n   - **Protect high-value/low-quantity resources**: Brick (only 13 units at 30 value) is scarce and high-impact; trading it away requires significant compensation.  \n   - **Leverage high-quantity/low-value resources**: I have surplus Sheep (23 units, value 12) and Wood (23 units, value 9)\u2014ideal for trading away to acquire high-value resources.\n\n3. **Negotiation Strategy**:  \n   - **Counter-offering**: Reject unfavorable offers and propose trades that exploit my surplus (e.g., Sheep) to target high-value resources (Brick/Ore).  \n   - **Risk Mitigation**: Player 0\u2019s repeated requests for Brick/Ore indicate they value them highly. I can leverage this to demand high-value returns for my low-value surpluses.  \n   - **Opponent Behavior Analysis**: Player 0 requested Ore earlier and Brick now\u2014suggesting a persistent high demand for these resources. I should exploit this by offering Sheep/Wood to extract Brick/Ore.\n\n4. **Trade Structure Insights**:  \n   - **Profit Margin**: Aim for >5 value gain per trade to offset risks and maximize cumulative benefits.  \n     - Example: Trading 2 Sheep (value 24) for 1 Brick (value 30) \u2192 +6 net gain.  \n   - **Avoid Break-even Trades**: No net gain trades (e.g., offering equal value) waste turns without progress.\n\n5. **Turn Efficiency**:  \n   - With 10 turns total and 2 turns elapsed, prioritize aggressive counter-offers to force value-positive outcomes. Passive denials waste opportunities.\n\n---\n\n### Trading Decision\nI reject Player 0\u2019s offer of 2 Wood for 1 Brick:  \n- **Net value loss**: I lose 30 value (Brick) and gain 18 value (2 Wood) \u2192 **\u221212 value change**.  \n- **Strategy conflict**: Trading scarce Brick for low-value Wood weakens my position.  \n\nInstead, I propose a counter-offer targeting value gain using my Sheep surplus:  \n- **Offer**: 2 Sheep (my value: 2\u00d712 = **24**) \u2192 Request 1 Brick (value: **30**).  \n- **Net gain**: +6 value.  \n- **Rationale**:  \n  - Uses my high-quantity/low-value resource (Sheep) to acquire high-value Brick.  \n  - Aligns with Player 0\u2019s perceived demand for Brick while preserving my scarce Ore.  \n  - Minimal risk: I retain 21 Sheep after trade.  \n\n**Action**:  \n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",

This means I should aim to trade resources I value less for resources I value more, or trade a smaller quantity of high-value resources for a larger quantity of slightly lower-value resources, resulting in a net value gain.\n2. **Resource Scarcity/Abundance:** I have abundant Wheat (19) and Wood (21), and relatively fewer Sheep (8), Brick (17), and Ore (16). This suggests I can be more flexible in offering Wheat and Wood, and more cautious with Sheep, Brick, and Ore, especially given their higher individual values.\n3. **Player 1's demonstrated preferences:** In previous turns, Player 1 rejected offers of 2 Wood, 4 Wheat for 1 Ore, and 2 Wood for 1 Brick. However, Player 1 offered 2 Sheep for 1 Brick, which I accepted. This suggests Player 1 might value Brick highly, and may be willing to give up Sheep. My acceptance of 2 Sheep for 1 Brick means I now have 6 Sheep and 18 Brick.\n4. **Current Holdings Review (after last trade):**\n    * Wheat: 19 (Value: 6) = 114\n    * Wood: 21 (Value: 9) = 189\n    * Sheep: 6 (Value: 17) = 102 (down from 8)\n    * Brick: 18 (Value: 24) = 432 (up from 17)\n    * Ore: 16 (Value: 35) = 560\n    * **Total Current Value:** 1397 (Previous total before Sheep/Brick trade was 1383, so gained 14 in that exchange)\n5. **Identify High-Value Targets:** Ore (35) and Brick (24) are my highest individual value resources. Acquiring more of these, especially Ore, would be very beneficial.\n6. **Identify Low-Value Offers:** Wheat (6) and Wood (9) are my lowest individual value resources and I have plenty of them. These are prime candidates to offer in trades. Sheep (17) is mid-range, and I now have less of it.\n7. **Propose Win-Win or Favorable Trades:** Consider what Player 1 might want based on their previous offers/rejections. They showed willingness to trade Sheep for Brick. I now have more Brick, so could potentially offer some if the exchange is still highly favorable for me, or if I can convert Brick into even higher value Ore.\n8. **Small Incremental Gains:** Even small value gains per turn accumulate over 10 turns. Don't wait for a \"perfect\" trade if a good one is available.\n9. **Experiment and Adapt:** If an offer is rejected, learn from it and adjust the next one.\n\nTrading Decision:\nPlayer 1 seemed interested in Brick, and I have just increased my Brick holdings. I should try to leverage my abundant low-value resources (Wheat, Wood) to acquire high-value resources (Ore). Given Player 1 rejected 2 Wood, 4 Wheat for 1 Ore before, I might need to sweeten the deal or offer something else. Player 1 also offered 2 Sheep for 1 Brick, which indicated their valuation of Brick.\n\nLet's look at the relative values again:\n* 1 Ore = 35\n* 1 Brick = 24\n* 1 Sheep = 17\n* 1 Wood = 9\n* 1 Wheat = 6\n\nMy goal is to increase my total value. I have plenty of Wheat and Wood. Ore is the most valuable resource.\n\nProposed Trade: Offer Wheat and/or Wood for Ore.\nPrevious offer was 2 Wood (18) + 4 Wheat (24) = 42 value for 1 Ore (35 value). This was a net loss for me, so it's good Player 1 rejected it, and it explains why I offered it (it was a bad previous offer). I should offer something more balanced or a net gain for me this time.\n\nConsider offering some of the newly acquired Brick if it can get me something even more valuable like Ore, or if it helps clear out lower value resources.\n\nOption 1: Try to get Ore for Wheat/Wood.\nHow much Wheat/Wood for 1 Ore (35 value)?\n* 3 Wood = 27. Still not enough for 1 Ore.\n* 4 Wood = 36. This is good, I get 1 Ore (35) for 4 Wood (36). Slight loss of 1 value, but I reduce my most abundant low-value resource and get my highest value resource. Good.\n* 3 Wood (27) + 2 Wheat (12) = 39. For 1 Ore (35). This is 4 value loss for me, acceptable for getting ore.\n* 2 Wood (18) + 3 Wheat (18) = 36. For 1 Ore (35). This is 1 value loss, very acceptable.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again. I have a lot of Wood.\nI will propose to give up a moderate amount of Wood for Ore.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

This highlights the importance of precise value calculation. I now have fewer Sheep (6) and more Brick (18). This reduces my overall value.\n    *   **My offer (4 Wood -> 1 Ore):** Value offered: 4*9 = 36. Value requested: 35. This was a small gain for me (gain 1 value). Player 1 rejected. It was a fair offer but perhaps not compelling enough.\n    *   **Player 1's offer (3 Wheat -> 1 Brick):** Value offered: 3*6 = 18. Value requested: 24. This is a potential *gain* of 6 value. This offer is good for me.\n\n8.  **Negotiation Posture:** Player 1 has rejected several of my offers and made one offer that was disadvantageous for me (but I accepted). Their latest offer is favorable to me. This indicates they might be willing to give up Brick for Wheat. I should be receptive to offers that increase my total value.\n\nMy current resources:\n+ [Wheat] Qty: 19 Value: 6 (Total 114)\n+ [Wood] Qty: 21 Value: 9 (Total 189)\n+ [Sheep] Qty: 6 Value: 17 (Total 102)\n+ [Brick] Qty: 18 Value: 24 (Total 432)\n+ [Ore] Qty: 16 Value: 35 (Total 560)\nTotal Value: 114 + 189 + 102 + 432 + 560 = 1397\n\nPrevious total value (before the faulty Sheep-Brick trade):\nWheat 19*6 = 114\nWood 21*9 = 189\nSheep 8*17 = 136\nBrick 17*24 = 408\nOre 16*35 = 560\nInitial Total Value: 114 + 189 + 136 + 408 + 560 = 1407\n\nMy value decreased by 10 in the last accepted trade. I need to recover this.\n\nDecision:\nPlayer 1 has offered 3 Wheat for 1 Brick.\nValue of 3 Wheat = 3 * 6 = 18\nValue of 1 Brick = 24\nIf I accept, I give up 18 value and gain 24 value, for a net gain of 6 value.\nThis is a good offer for me. I should accept it.\n\n[Accept]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge:\nBefore making a trading decision, I analyze key principles and historical patterns to maximize my total resource value:\n\n1. **Value-Based Trading**: Trade only if the net value gained is positive, based on my fixed valuations (Wheat:6, Wood:9, Sheep:12, Brick:30, Ore:37).  \n2. **Opportunity Focus**: Prioritize acquiring high-value resources (Brick/Ore) by trading lower-value surplus resources (Wheat/Wood/Sheep), as each unit of Brick (30) or Ore (37) yields disproportionately high gains.  \n3. **Counterparty Behavior**: Player 0 has accepted two trades where they gave 1 Brick for:  \n   - 2 Sheep (my cost: 24, gain: +6)  \n   - 3 Wheat (my cost: 18, gain: +12)  \n   This indicates Player 0 undervalues Brick relative to me and may accept similar deals.  \n4. **Scarcity & Leverage**: My excess Wheat (10) and Sheep (21) allow aggressive offers. Player 0\u2019s repeated offers for Ore suggest high demand, but I avoid trading it to preserve value.  \n5. **Efficiency & Magnitude**: Bundled offers can amplify gains. A larger ask (e.g., 2 Brick) might be accepted given Player 0\u2019s tendency to liquidate Brick.  \n\n### Trading Decision:\nI propose an optimized bundle leveraging Player 0\u2019s willingness to trade Brick:  \n- **Offer**: 3 Wheat + 1 Sheep for 2 Brick  \n- **Value Calculation**:  \n  - Cost to me: (3 \u00d7 6) + (1 \u00d7 12) = 18 + 12 = 30  \n  - Gain from 2 Brick: 2 \u00d7 30 = 60  \n  - **Net gain**: 60 - 30 = +30 (highest potential gain achieved historically).  \n\nThis offer mirrors accepted precedents (Wheat/Sheep for Brick) but scales the benefit. Given Player 0's past acceptance and my surplus, it balances appeal to them with maximized value for me.  \n\n[Offer: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This means I should always aim to acquire resources with a higher value-per-unit than what I'm giving up, or acquire highly valued resources with resources I have in abundance and value less.\n2.  **Resource Values:** I have resources with values ranging from 6 (Wheat) to 35 (Ore). Sheep (17), Brick (24), and Ore (35) are my most valuable resources. Wheat (6) and Wood (9) are my least valuable.\n3.  **Current Inventory:** I have a good quantity of Wheat (19), Wood (21), and Brick (17). Sheep (8) and Ore (16) are moderate.\n4.  **Past Interactions Analysis:**\n    *   I offered 2 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore (Value 2*9 + 4*6 = 18+24=42 -> 35). This was a bad offer for Player 1, as my offer had higher value than my request. Player 1 rightly rejected it. I seem to have overvalued my resources in earlier trades, or undervalued theirs.\n    *   I offered 2 Wood -> 1 Brick (Value 2*9=18 -> 24). This was a good offer for me, offering 18 value to gain 24 value. Player 1 rejected it. This suggests Player 1 values Brick highly or doesn't want Wood.\n    *   Player 1 offered 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick (Value 2*17=34 -> 24). This was a bad offer for me, giving up 34 value for 24 value. I *accepted* this, which was a clear mistake based on my objective. I might have been desperate to get Brick or misunderstood the values. I need to be more disciplined.\n    *   I offered 4 Wood -> 1 Ore (Value 4*9=36 -> 35). This was very close in value, slightly favoring me. Player 1 rejected it. Again, Player 1 seems unwilling to part with high-value resources for my low-value resources.\n    *   Player 1 offered 3 Wheat -> 1 Brick (Value 3*6=18 -> 24). This was a good offer for me, giving up 18 value for 24 value. I accepted this, which was a correct move.\n5.  **Player 1's Behavior:** Player 1 has shown a tendency to make offers where they gain value (2 Sheep -> 1 Brick). They are also reluctant to give up high-value resources (Brick, Ore) for my lower-value resources (Wood, Wheat). Player 1 seems to value Brick highly and possibly Sheep as well.\n6.  **Current Offer from Player 1:** Offered items: 3 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> Requested items: 2 Brick.\n    *   Value of offered items: (3 * 6) + (1 * 17) = 18 + 17 = 35\n    *   Value of requested items: (2 * 24) = 48\n    *   Analysis: I would give up 35 value to gain 48 value. This is a positive net gain for me (+13 value).\n7.  **Constraints:** Game lasts 10 turns. I need to make efficient trades. Don't be afraid to deny bad offers.\n\n[Accept]",
