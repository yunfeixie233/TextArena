      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\n1. **Value Assessment**: Understanding the current value of each resource is key. Resources can often be more favorable to trade based on demand and supply dynamics within the game. Identifying which resources are undervalued or overvalued can significantly influence trading outcomes.\n\n2. **Resource Synergy**: Some resources complement each other better than others. For instance, a combination of Brick and Ore may enable greater development opportunities, such as building or trading for more valuable goods. \n\n3. **Negotiation Techniques**: Effective negotiation often involves a win-win mindset. To increase the total value of resources, negotiating trades that seem beneficial to both parties can facilitate better relationships and future exchanges.\n\n4. **Timing of Trades**: The best time to trade is often when an opponent is desperate for a specific resource, or when you have excess stock of a resource that is in demand. \n\n5. **Scarcity and Demand**: As the game progresses, certain resources may become more scarce. Anticipating future needs or the likelihood of opponents needing specific resources could help to maximize trading advantages.\n\n### Trading Decision\n\nConsidering my current resources:\n\n- **Wheat**: 5 (value for a smaller quantity, but less needed)\n- **Wood**: 8 (good for building)\n- **Sheep**: 12 (valuable especially in larger quantities)\n- **Brick**: 22 (critical resource for building)\n- **Ore**: 39 (very valuable, especially with a high quantity)\n\nGiven I have a good quantity of Ore and a higher quantity of Sheep, I could leverage a trade that boosts my Brick, which is more limited in quantity, to build infrastructure or trade later.\n\nMy trading offer will be:\n\n**Trading Offer:**\n- Offer 3 Sheep (value: 36) and 2 Ore (value: 78), total value offered: 114.\n- Request 5 Brick (value: 110) and 2 Sheep (value: 24), total value requested: 134.\n\nI will propose the following trade:\n\n**Action**:\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1. **Value Maximization:** The primary goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means any trade I make or accept should result in a net positive value change.\n2. **Scarcity and Abundance:** Identify which resources I have in abundance (high quantity, perhaps lower individual value if I have too much) and which I lack (low quantity, potentially high individual value). I have a very high quantity of Brick (23) and Sheep (10), and a low quantity of Ore (6) and Wheat (8). Wood is moderate.\n3. **Resource Valuation:** Calculate the per-unit value of each resource to understand its relative worth.\n    * Wheat: 6\n    * Wood: 11\n    * Sheep: 12\n    * Brick: 29\n    * Ore: 33\n4. **Strategic Trading:**\n    * **Offloading Abundant Resources:** I should look to trade away resources I have in large quantities (Brick, Sheep) for resources I value more or have less of (Ore, Wood, Wheat).\n    * **Acquiring Valuable Resources:** Prioritize acquiring high-value resources (Ore, Brick, Wood) or resources that I have relatively few of, as these often contribute more significantly to total value.\n    * **Calculated Offers/Counter-offers:** Each offer should be calculated to yield a positive value for me. I need to sum the value of what I am offering and compare it to the value of what I am requesting. The requested value should be higher than the offered value for me to profit.\n5. **Evaluating Opponent's Offer:**\n    * Player 0 is offering: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore.\n    * Player 0 is requesting: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep.\n    * Calculate the value of what Player 0 is offering to me: (3 * 12) + (2 * 33) = 36 + 66 = 102.\n    * Calculate the value of what Player 0 is requesting from me: (5 * 29) + (2 * 12) = 145 + 24 = 169.\n    * Analysis: Player 0 wants me to give up 169 value for resources worth 102 value. This is a very bad trade for me (-67 value). I should definitely deny this.\n6. **Constructing Counter-offers:** Since I am Player 1, I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer. My counter-offer should benefit me significantly. I have a lot of Brick and Sheep, so I can afford to offer them. I want more Ore, Wood, or Wheat.\n\nCurrent Resources and Total Value:\n* Wheat: 8 * 6 = 48\n* Wood: 7 * 11 = 77\n* Sheep: 10 * 12 = 120\n* Brick: 23 * 29 = 667\n* Ore: 6 * 33 = 198\nTotal Value = 48 + 77 + 120 + 667 + 198 = 1110\n\nDecision:\nThe offer from Player 0 (Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> Request: 5 Brick, 2 Sheep) has a value of 102 for me, and costs me 169. This is a net loss of 67. I should deny this offer. Instead, I will propose a trade that leverages my abundance of Brick and Sheep to gain valuable Ore or Wood.\n\nI have 23 Brick and 10 Sheep. I desire more Ore (value 33) or Wood (value 11).\n\nLet's try to get Ore.\nIf I offer 5 Brick (5 * 29 = 145), what could I request in return?\nMaybe 4 Ore? (4 * 33 = 132). This is a loss for me.\nMaybe 5 Ore? (5 * 33 = 165). This is a gain (165 - 145 = 20). This is reasonable.\n\nConsider offering Sheep and Brick for Ore.\nIf I offer 3 Brick and 2 Sheep (3*29 + 2*12 = 87 + 24 = 111) for 4 Ore (4*33 = 132). This is a gain of 21 for me. This seems like a win-win or at least a good offer for me that the opponent might consider.\n\nLet's ensure I don't give away too much of valuable resources. My Ore is already low (6). I should be acquiring Ore.\n\nMy offer: Trade some high-quantity, medium-high value resources (Brick, Sheep) for higher-value, lower-quantity resources (Ore).\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 4 Ore]",

Understanding the value of what is being offered versus what is being asked is crucial. For instance, my Ore has a high value (39 for 19), which makes it a valuable trading item.\n\n2. **Scarcity and Demand**: Monitor what resources are in demand.

Understanding what your opponent values can lead to a more profitable trade.\n\n5. **Long-term Value**: Consider how trades will benefit you in future rounds.

This means I should evaluate any trade based on the net change in value.\n2.  **Resource Analysis (Current Inventory):**\n    *   [Wheat]   Qty: 8    Value: 6 (Total: 48) - Low individual value, moderate quantity.\n    *   [Wood]    Qty: 7    Value: 11 (Total: 77) - Moderate individual value, moderate quantity.\n    *   [Sheep]   Qty: 10   Value: 12 (Total: 120) - Moderate individual value, high quantity.\n    *   [Brick]   Qty: 23   Value: 29 (Total: 667) - High individual value, very high quantity.

This is a very desirable resource.\n3.  **Understanding Player 0's Offer:** Player 0 offered: 3 Sheep (3 * 12 = 36 value), 2 Brick (2 * 29 = 58 value) -> for 4 Ore (4 * 33 = 132 value).\n    *   Value I receive: 3 Sheep (36) + 2 Brick (58) = 94\n    *   Value I give up: 4 Ore (132)\n    *   Net change for me: 94 - 132 = -38. This offer significantly *decreases* my total value.\n4.  **Previous Negotiations:**\n    *   My previous offer (3 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 4 Ore) was rejected. This suggests Player 0 values Ore highly or considers my offer insufficient. My offer's value: (3 * 29) + (2 * 12) = 87 + 24 = 111. Requested value: (4 * 33) = 132. My previous offer was already a negative value trade for me (-21), but significantly less negative than Player 0's current offer.\n    *   Player 0's last offer (3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep) was rejected by me because it involved me giving up high-value Ore for lower-value Sheep and Brick.\n5.  **Strategic Implications:**\n    *   Player 0 seems consistently interested in my Ore. This is good information; I know what they want.\n    *   Player 0 consistently offers Sheep and/or Brick. They may have an abundance of these or value them less than I do.\n    *   My Brick quantity is very high. While its individual value is high, perhaps I can afford to part with some of it if I receive something more valuable in return, especially Ore.\n    *   I need to be cautious about trading away my high-value Ore, as it's my highest individual value resource. I should only do so if the net value gain is significant.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Current Offer:**\n    *   Incoming offer: 3 Sheep (36 value), 2 Brick (58 value) -> for 4 Ore (132 value).\n    *   My value gained: 36 + 58 = 94.\n    *   My value lost: 132.\n    *   Net change: -38. This is a bad trade for me. I should deny it.\n\n7.  **Formulating a Counter-Offer:**\n    *   Player 0 wants Ore. I have it.\n    *   I want to increase my total value.\n    *   I have a lot of Brick.\n    *   My previous offer of 3 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 4 Ore was too high for Player 0 (value lost for me: 111, value gained for them: 132, net +21 for them). It was a bad trade for me, but it was still rejected by them, meaning they wanted more value for their Ore.\n    *   Player 0's current offer is very unfair (-38 for me).\n    *   Perhaps I can offer more Brick, especially given my large supply, to acquire Ore, but I need to ensure the trade is favorable or at least neutral for me.\n    *   Let's aim for a slightly positive or neutral trade for me, recognizing that some trades might be necessary to get resources that are strategic for future turns (if this were a game with production, which it is not, so strictly value-based for now).\n    *   If I give up 4 Ore (132 value), what could I get for it? I would want something worth at least 132.\n    *   Player 0 offered 3 Sheep (36) and 2 Brick (58), total 94. They are valuing 4 Ore at 94. This is a very low valuation from their side.\n    *   Let's try to negotiate for Player 0's Ore using my high quantity Brick.\n    *   What if I offer a significant amount of Brick for less Ore, making it a fair value for me?\n    *   Or, since Player 0 keeps offering Sheep, maybe I can incorporate some of my high-quantity Sheep in an offer to get Ore.\n    *   My 3 Brick (29 * 3 = 87) + 2 Sheep (12 * 2 = 24) = 111 for 4 Ore (132) was rejected.\n    *   What about 4 Brick (29 * 4 = 116) + 1 Sheep (12 * 1 = 12) = 128 for 4 Ore (132). Still a small loss for me (-4).\n    *   Given Player 0's clear desire for Ore, I should consider if I can extract more from them for it.\n    *   Their offer of 3 Sheep, 2 Brick for 4 Ore is a clear value drain for me.\n    *   I need to make an offer that either nets me positive value for my high-value Ore or trades my overly abundant Brick for a resource I value.\n    *   Let's try to get more Ore for less of my valuable resources, or at least a fair trade.\n\nThe current offer from Player 0 is: Offered items: 3 Sheep, 2 Brick -> Requested items: 4 Ore.\nValue of Player 0's offer to me: 3 Sheep (3*12=36) + 2 Brick (2*29=58) = 94.\nValue of my resources requested by Player 0: 4 Ore (4*33=132).\nNet change for me: 94 - 132 = -38. This is a very bad trade.\n\nMy previous offer: 3 Brick (87), 2 Sheep (24) -> 4 Ore (132). Value given: 111. Value received: 132. My net: +21 value if accepted. This was a good offer for Player 0, yet they rejected it. This suggests Player 0 wants *more* than 4 Ore for that trade, or they value the 3 Brick/2 Sheep as less than 111.\n\nIt seems Player 0 is valuing Ore very highly, and they are trying to get it from me at a very low cost. I should not accept their current offer.\n\nLet's try to counter with an offer for their Ore, but at a more favorable rate for me, using my abundant Brick. What if I aim for 2 Ore (66 value)?\nI have a lot of Brick. Let's offer some Brick for Ore.\nHow much Brick for 2 Ore? 2 Brick = 58. Not enough. 3 Brick = 87. This would be 87 value for 66 value, a -21 for me. Bad.\nWhat about 3 Brick for 1 Ore? 3 Brick (87) for 1 Ore (33). Terrible.\n\nI need to get *rid* of Brick and Sheep or Wheat, and gain Ore or Wood.\nPlayer 0 seems to want my Ore.\n\nMy goal is to increase my total value.\nGiven their last offer, they are trying to lowball me on Ore. I should not accept this.\nI need to make a counter offer that increases my value.\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Brick, which I have a lot of, for a smaller quantity of their Ore?\nExample:\nOffer: 5 Brick (5 * 29 = 145) -> 3 Ore (3 * 33 = 99). Still losing value. (-46)\n\nLet's rethink. Player 0 seems desperate for Ore. I have it. I should leverage this.\nTheir last offer was 3 Sheep + 2 Brick for 4 Ore.\nMy current total value:\nWheat: 8 * 6 = 48\nWood: 7 * 11 = 77\nSheep: 10 * 12 = 120\nBrick: 23 * 29 = 667\nOre: 6 * 33 = 198\nTotal: 1110\n\nI need to make a move that increases this 1110.\nTheir previous offer was: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep.\nTheir current offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 4 Ore.\n\nGiven their persistent lowballing, I'm not going to give up my valuable Ore easily.\nLet's make an offer where I propose giving high quantity low value items in exchange for some Ore.\nI have 10 Sheep (12 value each) and 8 Wheat (6 value each).\nWhat about: 7 Sheep (7 * 12 = 84) + 2 Wheat (2 * 6 = 12) = 96 value for 3 Ore (3 * 33 = 99). This is fairly balanced (-3 for me) and uses my lower value resources. This might be more appealing to them if they are short on these.\n\nLet's also consider what Player 0 has offered in the past: They have offered Sheep and Brick. So they might have a surplus of those. This suggests they are unlikely to want my Sheep or Brick *for* their valuable Ore unless it's a very good deal for them.\n\nMy best strategy might be to try and get them to overpay for my Ore since they clearly want it.\nIf I give up 2 Ore (66 value). What do I want?\nI could try for their high value resources, but I don't know what they have.\nGiven they offer Sheep and Brick, they probably have an abundance.\n\nIf I'm firm on my Ore value, I need to demand a lot.\nLet's try a bold move focusing on getting more value in. I'm not desperate to trade my Ore.\nI need to increase my total value.\nWhat about offering a large quantity of a low value resource for a small quantity of a high value resource.\nI have plenty of Brick and Sheep.\nWhat about 10 Brick (290) for 5 Ore (165)? Bad for me.\n\nLet's focus on the *current proposal* from Player 0: 3 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 4 Ore.\nThis is a bad trade for me (-38 value). I must reject it.\n\nWhat counter-offer can I make?\nSince they want Ore, I should make them pay for it.\nMy previous counter-offer (3 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 4 Ore; value 111 for 132 value) was rejected. This implies they want more than 21 value gain for them.\nSo if I want to trade 4 Ore, I need to get at least 132 back, or close to it.\nMy Brick (29) and Sheep (12) are their common offer.\nTo get 4 Ore (132 value), I need to offer something worth at least 132.\nIf I offer 4 Brick (116 value) and 1 Sheep (12 value) = 128 value. This would make me lose 4 value.\nPlayer 0 has consistently tried to make me lose value on Ore trades.\n\nPerhaps I should try to acquire one of Player 0's resources that I don't have, or want more of.\nThe game is purely about value. So I need to increase net value.\n\nLet's try to ask for more from Player 0 than what they want from me for the same amount of Ore.\nIf I offer 2 Ore (66 value)\nWhat would I want back? More Brick or Sheep? No, that's what I have an abundance of.\nI want to increase my Ore quantity or acquire a resource that I deem more valuable given current ratios.\n\nSince they repeatedly want my Ore, I will offer some Ore, but demand a *positive* net value for myself.\nIf I offer 2 Ore (66 value). I would need to get back items worth more than 66.\nPlayer 0 offered Sheep and Brick.\nPerhaps 10 Sheep (12 * 10 = 120) for 2 Ore (66) + some Sheep/Brick. No, that's not good.\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Ore (33 value) for a large amount of their Sheep and Brick?\nOffer: 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep (36) + 1 Brick (29) = 65? This is good (+32 for me) and involves their likely surplus.\nThis trade is for my benefit: +32 value. Let's try this.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep, 1 Brick]",

If you have an excess of a certain resource (like Sheep, which you have a lot of), it may be worth trading even if the individual value isn't the highest.\n\n4. **Negotiation Tactics**: Be patient and strategic. If a trade offer does not seem beneficial, don\u2019t hesitate to reject it and look for better opportunities.\n\n5. **Building Relationships**: Sometimes maintaining good relations with other players can lead to better offers in subsequent rounds.\n\n**Current Situation**:\nYou are Player 0 and currently have:\n- Wheat: 13 (Value: 5)\n- Wood: 7 (Value: 8)\n- Sheep: 19 (Value: 12)\n- Brick: 13 (Value: 22)\n- Ore: 19 (Value: 39)\n\nYou have a large quantity of Sheep, which could serve as a useful resource in trades. \n\n**Decision on Player 1's Offer**:\nPlayer 1 made an offer of:\n- Offered items: 1 Ore\n- Requested items: 3 Sheep, 1 Brick\n\n**Analysis of Player 1's Offer**:\n- 1 Ore has a value of 39.\n- 3 Sheep (totaling value 36) and 1 Brick (value 22) total a value of 58.\n\nFor you to give away 3 Sheep and 1 Brick for 1 Ore doesn't appear to be a favorable exchange because you will be losing more total value than you gain, and you possess more than enough Sheep and the Brick value is significantly high in comparison to the single Ore offered.\n\n**Decision**:\nGiven this analysis, I will reject Player 1's offer.\n\n**Your action**:\n[Deny]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This means any trade must result in me receiving resources of higher total value than those I give away.\n2.  **Current Resources and Values:**\n    *   Wheat: 8 @ 6 = 48\n    *   Wood: 7 @ 11 = 77\n    *   Sheep: 10 @ 12 = 120\n    *   Brick: 23 @ 29 = 667\n    *   Ore: 6 @ 33 = 198\n    *   Total Value: 48 + 77 + 120 + 667 + 198 = 1110\n3.  **Resource Abundance/Scarcity:** I have a very high quantity of Brick (23) and Sheep (10). Ore (6) and Wood (7) are moderate, and Wheat (8) is also moderate. Brick has a high individual value, but also a high quantity. Ore has the highest individual value.\n4.  **Identifying Good Trades:**\n    *   **Giving Away:** I should prioritize giving away resources I have in abundance, especially if their individual value is lower, or if I can get a much higher value resource in return. Brick and Sheep are good candidates for offering.\n    *   **Receiving:** I want to receive high-value resources, ideally Ore, or resources that are currently scarce for me but have high value. Wheat is the lowest value resource for me, so converting it might be an option if the gain is substantial. However, Ore is the most valuable resource for me, and I only have 6. Increasing my Ore count would be beneficial.\n5.  **Analyzing Past Offers (My Player History):**\n    *   P1 offered: 3 Brick (87) + 2 Sheep (24) = 111 -> 4 Ore (132). This was a good offer for me (+21 value), but P0 rejected it. This suggests P0 values Ore highly or doesn't want to overpay.\n    *   P1 offered: 1 Ore (33) -> 3 Sheep (36) + 1 Brick (29) = 65. This was a bad offer for me (-32 value) if my goal is to *increase* my total value. This needs to be corrected. I should *not* offer my valuable Ore unless I get significantly more value back. I was likely trying to clear less valuable resources, but the exchange was unfavorable. My previous move was a mistake based on my objective. *Self-correction: Focus on increasing total value, not just clearing stock.*\n6.  **Analyzing Past Offers (P0's History):**\n    *   P0 offered: 3 Sheep (36) + 2 Ore (66) = 102 -> 5 Brick (145) + 2 Sheep (24). This implies P0 wanted to trade Ore for Brick. P0 was offering an overall negative value for themselves (102 given for 169 received), which is suspicious or a miscalculation on their part. If the offer was 3 Sheep + 2 Ore for *my* 5 Brick + 2 Sheep (as in, P0 buying *my* Brick), then P0 was offering 102 value for 169 value from me, which is a great deal for me, but P1 rejected it. Reviewing the format: \"Offered items: A -> Requested items: B\". So P0 was giving A and wanting B.\n        *   P0 offered: 3 Sheep (36) + 2 Ore (66) [Value 102] -> Requested: 5 Brick (145) + 2 Sheep (24) [Value 169]. P0 was looking for a net gain of 67, but was offering 102 for 169 (P0 getting 169 and giving 102). This means P0 valued Brick *very* highly or was trying to unload Ore. My rejection was correct as it was too much value to give up. My interpretation of the initial rejected offer: My 5 Brick + 2 Sheep are worth 169. P0's 3 Sheep + 2 Ore are worth 102. If I accept, I give 169 and get 102. This is a bad trade for me. (Value change: 102-169 = -67). So my rejection was correct.\n    *        P0 offered: 3 Sheep (36) + 2 Brick (58) [Value 94] -> Requested: 4 Ore (132). P0 was looking for 4 Ore, offering a total of 94 value. If accepted, I would give 4 Ore (132) and get 94 value. This is -38 value for me. My rejection was correct.\n7.  **P0's Wants:** P0 seems very keen on getting Ore. They offered for it twice. They are also willing to offer Sheep and Brick.\n8.  **Strategy for next turn:**\n    *   Leverage my high Brick quantity and P0's apparent desire for Ore.\n    *   My previous offer of 3 Brick + 2 Sheep for 4 Ore was +21 for me. P0 rejected it. This difference (21) might be too large for P0.\n    *   Consider a smaller, more balanced offer that still benefits me, focusing on gaining Ore.\n    *   What about trading Brick for Ore? I have 23 Brick (much more than P0's desire for 5). I have 6 Ore.\n    *   Let's aim to gain Ore, perhaps by giving Brick or Sheep.\n    *   Current Ore value: 33. Current Brick value: 29. Current Sheep value: 12.\n    *   To get 1 Ore (33), I could offer 1 Brick (29) and 1 Sheep (12) = 41. (Still positive for P0 if they value Ore higher). This is okay for me (+33 - 41 = -8, bad trade).\n    *   To get 1 Ore (33), I could offer 2 Brick (58). This is bad for me.\n    *   Maybe offer resources that P0 seems to have less value for, like Sheep or Brick, and ask for high-value Ore.\n    *   The previous successful offer (for me) of 3 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 4 Ore was rejected. That was 111 value for 132 value. A gain of 21.\n    *   How about 2 Brick + 2 Sheep for 3 Ore?\n        *   My offer: 2 Brick (58) + 2 Sheep (24) = 82\n        *   Their requested: 3 Ore (99)\n        *   This is a net gain of +17 value for me (99 - 82). This is a bit less than the previous (21 gain), potentially more appealing to P0. I still have plenty of Brick and Sheep.\n    *   Another option: 1 Brick + 1 Sheep for 1 Ore. My value: 29+12 = 41. Their value: 33. This is -8 for me.\n    *   What if I offer 3 Brick for 2 Ore (P0's past interest)?\n        *   My offer: 3 Brick (87)\n        *   Their requested: 2 Ore (66)\n        *   This is bad for me (-21). I need to GET MORE VALUE.\n    *   I need to always get more value than I give.\n    *   Let's revisit the 2 Brick + 2 Sheep -> 3 Ore option. My gain of 17 is good. I reduce my abundant resources (Brick, Sheep) and gain my most valuable resource (Ore).\n\nTrading Decision:\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 3 Ore]",

Each resource has a different value (Wheat: 5, Wood: 8, Sheep: 12, Brick: 22, Ore: 39). This means that in negotiations, having a clear understanding of the worth of what you offer versus what you ask for is essential.\n\n2. **Scarcity and Demand**: Resources that are in high demand or are less abundant can be leveraged for more favorable trades. In this game, evaluate which resources your trading partner may need that you have in surplus.\n\n3. **Trade Equivalence**: When proposing trades, ensure that the items offered and requested have equivalent or higher value for your side of the trade. For instance, trading lower-value items for higher-value ones will result in an increase in total resource value.\n\n4. **Reciprocity**: Trading partners are likely to offer deals that favor their needs. Be prepared to negotiate and counteroffer based on the desired resources.\n\n5. **Flexibility**: Being adaptable in what you offer can lead to success.

I should reject it.\n6.  **Counter-Offering Strategy:** Since Player 0 seems desperate for Ore, I should continue to leverage my small but highly valuable Ore stock. I can demand more valuable resources (e.g., Ore from their side, or very favorable Brick/Sheep/Wheat for my Ore) or a larger quantity of their less valuable resources for my Ore. I need to make offers that are profitable for me, possibly by giving up my abundant but lower-value resources for their high-value or desired resources.\n7.  **Current Resources and their Total Value:**\n    *   Wheat: 8 * 6 = 48\n    *   Wood: 7 * 11 = 77\n    *   Sheep: 10 * 12 = 120\n    *   Brick: 23 * 29 = 667\n    *   Ore: 6 * 33 = 198\n    *   Total Value: 48 + 77 + 120 + 667 + 198 = 1110. (Note: The previous accepted trade changed quantities. Let's recalculate based on the last accepted trade from Player 0: \"4 Sheep, 3 Brick -> 2 Ore, 2 Wheat\".\n        *   Initial: Wheat 8, Wood 7, Sheep 10, Brick 23, Ore 6\n        *   After previous trade:\n            *   Wheat: 8 + 2 = 10\n            *   Wood: 7\n            *   Sheep: 10 - 4 = 6\n            *   Brick: 23 - 3 = 20\n            *   Ore: 6 + 2 = 8\n        *   New Current Quantities: Wheat 10, Wood 7, Sheep 6, Brick 20, Ore 8.\n    *   New Total Value Check:\n        *   Wheat: 10 * 6 = 60\n        *   Wood: 7 * 11 = 77\n        *   Sheep: 6 * 12 = 72\n        *   Brick: 20 * 29 = 580\n        *   Ore: 8 * 33 = 264\n        *   New Total Value: 60 + 77 + 72 + 580 + 264 = 1053.\n        *   Initial total value was 1110. The previous trade was a net *loss* of 57 value. This highlights the importance of precise calculations. The previous trade of \"4 Sheep (48), 3 Brick (87) -> 2 Ore (66), 2 Wheat (12)\" meant I gave up 135 value and gained 78 value for a net loss of 57. This was a bad trade. I need to be more careful.\n    *   My current total value is 1053. My goal is to increase this.\n8.  **Re-evaluating the Current Offer (based on updated inventory):**\n    *   Player 0 offers: 2 Brick (2 * 29 = 58), 3 Wheat (3 * 6 = 18). Total received value: 76.\n    *   Player 0 requests: 3 Ore (3 * 33 = 99). Total given value: 99.\n    *   Net Change: 76 - 99 = -23. Still a significant loss. I have 8 Ore, so giving 3 Ore is 37.5% of my Ore.\n9.  **Formulating a Counter-Offer:** I have plenty of Brick and Wheat. I want more Ore. Given Player 0's consistent offers for my Ore, they clearly need it. I should offer my lower value items for their Ore.\n    * I have 20 Brick, 10 Wheat, 6 Sheep.\n    * I want more Ore.\n    * A 2:1 ratio for my low value to their high value is often a good start. For example, 2 Brick (58) for 1 Ore (33). Or 3 Wheat (18) for 1 Ore (33). Neither is good for me.\n    * I need to get a positive value trade.\n    * I can offer 1 Ore (33) for a combination of their higher-value items.\n    * If they want my Ore, I should ask for a lot of their less valuable items.\n    * How about offering a large quantity of my Brick/Wheat for a small quantity of their valuable Ore?\n    * Offering items I have in abundance for higher value items or items I am low on.\n    * Current Inventory: Wheat 10, Wood 7, Sheep 6, Brick 20, Ore 8.\n    * I need to recover value from the previous bad trade.\n    * Offer: 5 Brick (5*29=145) for 3 Ore (3*33=99). Net gain of 46. This is too much for Player 0 to accept.\n    * Offer from me: 4 Brick (4*29=116) for 2 Ore (2*33=66). Net gain of 50 for me. Still too much.\n    * Player 0 is offering 2 Brick (58) and 3 Wheat (18) for 3 Ore (99). My net loss: 23.\n    * I want to make an offer that is slightly better than what they offered previously or signals my willingness to give some Ore, but at a fair price for *me*.\n    * What if I aim for a 0 or slightly positive sum trade if it helps me get more Ore?\n    * I want Ore. I have plenty of Brick.\n    * I will offer Brick for Ore. How much Brick for how much Ore?\n    * How about 3 Brick (87) for 2 Ore (66)? This is a net value of -21 for me. This is not good.\n    * I need to give up resources I value less for resources I value more.\n    * Try to get 1 Ore (33) for less than 33 value of my resources.\n    * I have 20 Brick (29 value). 1 Brick (29) for 1 Ore (33) is a net +4 value. This is highly unlikely they accept.\n    * Try 2 Brick (58) for 1 Ore (33). Net value -25. This is bad for me.\n    * I have Wheat (6) and Sheep (12).\n    * If I offer less Ore, then I can ask for less in return.\n    * Let's aim to get at least 1 Ore, given their desire for it.\n    * Offer: 6 Sheep (72) for 3 Ore (99)? Net -27.\n    * I will deny their offer due to negative value for me.\n    * I need to make a counter-offer that is favorable to me but still somewhat appealing to them, especially given their clear need for Ore.\n    * How about offering 1 Ore for a beneficial combination of their resources?\n    * If I give 1 Ore (33), what do I want?\n    * Maybe offer 1 Ore and some Brick for a different quantity of Ore or Wheat/Wood? No, I want to obtain Ore.\n    * My last bid failed: 2 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 3 Ore, which means I offered 2*29+2*12=58+24=82 for 3*33=99. Net -17. No wonder that failed.\n    * My last successful trade was a net loss. I need to correct this.\n    * Let's think about smaller, more targeted trades.\n    * Player 0's offer: 2 Brick, 3 Wheat -> 3 Ore. (Value: give up 99, gain 76. Net -23).\n    * I will deny this.\n    * I need to offer less of my high-value items for higher amounts of their more valuable ones (or higher quantities of their less valuable ones).\n    * I would like to get more Ore.\n    * I have plenty of Brick (20) and Wheat (10).\n    * Let's try to offer a large amount of my least valuable resources for a single Ore.\n    * Offer: 5 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (33). Net +3. This is a small gain for me, might be acceptable if they need Wheat. But they really want my Ore.\n    * How about 1 Ore (33) in exchange for items that equate to a higher value for me?\n    * What if I propose giving up 1 Ore for 2 Brick and 1 Wood from them? Val (1 Ore)=33. Val (2 Brick + 1 Wood) = 2*29 + 1*11 = 58+11 = 69. Net +36 for me. This is too much.\n    * I want to make a balanced counter-offer that gains me value.\n    * Given their offer, 2 Brick, 3 Wheat -> 3 Ore, which is a value difference of 23 in their favor.\n    * I have 8 Ore currently. I can afford to give up some, but only for a profit.\n    * Let's try a small Ore trade for a profit.\n    * Offer: 1 Ore (33) and 1 Sheep (12) -> 3 Brick (87). My net gain: 87 - (33+12) = 87 - 45 = 42. This might be too good for me.\n    * Let's stick to offering cheap resources for valuable ones.\n    * I will offer items (Brick/Wheat/Sheep) that I have a lot of, and request Ore.\n    * Offer: 3 Brick (87) and 3 Wheat (18) for 3 Ore (99). Net: 99 - (87+18) = 99 - 105 = -6. Still a loss.\n    * I need to gain value.\n    * What about giving up a lot of Brick for a small amount of Ore?\n    * 5 Brick ($145) for 2 Ore ($66)? Net gain for me: $79. They would never accept.\n    * I need to shift my resources towards higher value ones.\n\nMy decision for this turn:\n1.  **Reject Player 0's offer:** 2 Brick, 3 Wheat -> 3 Ore. (Net value for me: -23).\n2.  **Make a new offer:** Focus on giving an abundant resource (Brick) for a valuable resource (Ore), aiming for a slight positive value for me.\n\nMy resources: Wheat 10, Wood 7, Sheep 6, Brick 20, Ore 8.\nValues: Wheat 6, Wood 11, Sheep 12, Brick 29, Ore 33.\n\nI want to acquire Ore. I have 8 Ore. Player 0 clearly wants it.\nI have a LOT of Brick (20).\n\nLet's try to offer a reasonable quantity of Brick for 1 Ore.\nIf I offer 2 Brick (58) for 1 Ore (33). I lose 25 value. Bad for me.\nIf I offer 1 Brick (29) for 1 Ore (33). I gain 4 value. Good for me, but maybe too good for them to accept.\n\nI need to calculate the value of the current offer properly.\nPlayer 0 Offer: 2 Brick (58), 3 Wheat (18) -> My Resources: 3 Ore (99)\nTheir requested value: 99. My obtained value: 76. My Net Change: -23.\n\nI will offer Brick (my most abundant valuable, but not highest value/unit) for Ore.\nOffer: 3 Brick (3 * 29 = 87) -> 2 Ore (2 * 33 = 66).\nMy Net Gain: 66 (incoming) - 87 (outgoing) = -21. This is also bad. I am calculating this wrong or I am consistently proposing bad trades for myself.\n\nLet's reverse it. I gain 2 Ore (66), give 3 Brick (87). This is a loss. I need to make sure the \"Requested Resources\" value is higher than the \"Offered Resources\" value.\n\n[Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\nI offer resources. I request resources.\nWhat I give = Offered Resources. What I get = Requested Resources.\nThe value of Requested Resources should be greater than the value of Offered Resources for me to gain value.\n\nSo, for [Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]:\nOffered Resources (My give): 3 Brick (3 * 29 = 87)\nRequested Resources (My get): 2 Ore (2 * 33 = 66)\nNet Value Change for Me: 66 - 87 = -21. This is a loss.\n\nI need to give less valuable items and/or get more valuable items.\n\nLet's aim to give up my valuable Ore for even more value.\nNo, I want *more* Ore, not less. (Unless I'm trading it for an even bigger net profit.)\n\nI have 20 Brick. I have 8 Ore.\nHow about I offer 4 Brick (116) for 1 Ore (33)? Bad.\nWhat if I give up my Wheat and Sheep for Ore?\nOffer: 10 Wheat (60) and 2 Sheep (24) -> 3 Ore (99). My Net: 99 - 84 = +15.\nThis is a positive value trade for me. It might be too large a request for them.\nI have 10 Wheat. I can give all of it for a good trade.\nI have 6 Sheep. I can give all of it for a good trade.\n\nLet's simplify. I want to convert my Brick into Ore.\nI have 20 Brick (value 29 per unit), 8 Ore (value 33 per unit).\nTheir offer: 2 Brick (58), 3 Wheat (18) -> 3 Ore (99). My Net -23.\n\nMy proposed offer: What about 1 Ore for some combination of their resources?\nI want to gain value.\nI have 8 Ore. Giving away one is okay if I get value back.\n\nPlayer 0 might be low on Brick, or Wheat.\nPlayer 0 offered 2 Brick and 3 Wheat for 3 Ore. This means they are willing to give Brick and Wheat.\n\nLet's make a smaller positive trade for me.\nIf I offer 3 Brick (87) and request 2 Ore (66). This is a loss of 21.\n\nI need to get the \"Requested\" value higher than the \"Offered\" value.\nI will offer 2 Brick (58) for 1 Ore (33) and 1 Wood (11). Total 44. Net -14. Still bad.\n\nWhat if I offer 2 Sheep (24) for 1 Ore (33)? Net +9. This is good for me. Is it good for them? Depends on their stock.\nI have 6 Sheep. I can spare 2. Player 0 has offered Sheep in the past (e.g., 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep). This means they might have Sheep to trade.\n\nLet's try to target a trade that gives me a small positive value and gets me valuable Ore.\n**My current inventory:** Wheat 10, Wood 7, Sheep 6, Brick 20, Ore 8.\n**My goal:** Increase total value. Prioritize acquiring Ore.\n\nPlayer 0's consistent desire for my Ore makes it a strong bargaining chip.\nI will make an offer for Ore, giving up resources I have in abundance.\nLet's try: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]\nOffered Resources (My give): 2 Sheep (2 * 12 = 24), 3 Brick (3 * 29 = 87). Total = 111.\nRequested Resources (My get): 2 Ore (2 * 33 = 66).\nNet Value Change for Me: 66 - 111 = -45. This is a massive loss. My calculations are consistently leading me astray when I apply them.\n\nLet's re-read the format for clarity.\n[Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\nI offer 2 Sheep, 3 Brick. I request 2 Ore.\nValue of what I offer (give): 2 Sheep (24) + 3 Brick (87) = 111.\nValue of what I request (get): 2 Ore (66).\nMy total value decreases by 45. This is the opposite of my goal.\n\nI need to make sure the resources *I request* are *more valuable* than the resources *I offer*.\n\nOffer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick, 2 Sheep\nOffered (My give): 2 Ore (66)\nRequested (My get): 3 Brick (87) + 2 Sheep (24) = 111\nNet Value Change for Me: 111 - 66 = +45. This is a very good trade for me, but it means I give up my valuable Ore. I have 8 Ore, so 2 is 25% of my Ore. This could be a good \"cash-in\" trade.\n\nGiven that Player 0 wants Ore, maybe I can give them some Ore, but make a profit.\nPrevious Player 0 offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 4 Ore\nValue offered by P0: 3 Sheep (36) + 2 Brick (58) = 94\nValue requested by P0 (from me): 4 Ore (132).\nMy gain: 94 for 132. Net loss for me of 38. That's why I rejected it.\n\nPlayer 0's current offer: 2 Brick (58), 3 Wheat (18) -> 3 Ore (99). My Net -23.\n\nI want to gain Ore. But I also need to gain value.\nI will reject their current offer.\n\nThen I will make a counter offer, trying to acquire Ore by parting with my abundant Brick.\nI have 20 Brick. They offered Brick. This means they are not short on it.\nThis makes trading Brick for Ore difficult unless I overpay significantly.\n\nMy goal is to increase total value, and increase my stock of highly valuable resources (Ore, Wood) if possible.\n\nConsider Player 0's offer again: 2 Brick (58), 3 Wheat (18) -> 3 Ore (99).\nThey offer total value 76. They want value 99. They want to gain 23 value.\n\nI will try to make an offer where I give:\n- My abundant Brick\n- My abundant Wheat\n- My abundant Sheep\n\nAnd request:\n- Ore primarily\n- Wood secondarily\n\nHow about: I give a lot of Brick for a small amount of Ore.\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 2 Ore]\nMy give: 5 Brick (5 * 29 = 145)\nMy get: 2 Ore (2 * 33 = 66)\nNet Value Change for Me: 66 - 145 = -79. This is a huge loss.\n\nI need to stop making offers where the \"offered\" value is higher than the \"requested\" value.\nThis is the fundamental problem in my previous turns. I was burning value.\n\nLet's try to get 1 Ore.\nIf I request 1 Ore (33), what do I offer?\nI need to offer less than 33 value.\nI have Wheat (6), Wood (11), Sheep (12), Brick (29), Ore (33).\nThe only way to offer less than 33 for 1 Ore is to offer items that are individually low value.\nOffer: 3 Wheat (18) -> 1 Ore (33). Net +15. This is a very good trade for me. Is it reasonable for them?\nPlayer 0 offered 3 Wheat as part of their last offer. So they have Wheat. They also want Ore.\nThis seems like a plausible starting point for a profitable negotiation for me. It's a clear value gain.\nI have 10 Wheat. Giving 3 is fine.\n\nThis seems like the best approach to gain value while targeting Ore.\n\nFinal check:\nCurrent Inventory: Wheat 10, Wood 7, Sheep 6, Brick 20, Ore 8.\nCurrent Total Value: 1053.\nProposed Offer: [Offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered by me: 3 Wheat * 6 = 18.\nValue requested by me: 1 Ore * 33 = 33.\nNet value change for me: 33 - 18 = +15.\nNew Inventory if accepted: Wheat 7, Wood 7, Sheep 6, Brick 20, Ore 9.\nNew Total Value: 1053 + 15 = 1068. This is an increase.\n\nPlayer 0 made the offer of (2 Brick, 3 Wheat -> 3 Ore). This is a negative value for me. I should reject it.\n\nAction: Reject Player 0's current offer.\nAction: Make a counter offer that generates positive value for me.\n\nMy last offer was 2 Brick, 2 Sheep -> 3 Ore, which was a net loss for me. No wonder it was rejected. I need to get this right.\n\nThis turn I will:\n1. Deny Player 0's offer (2 Brick, 3 Wheat -> 3 Ore).\n2. Offer 3 Wheat for 1 Ore. Value gain +15.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"deny\"\n}\n```\nPlayer needs to provide an action based on the game instructions. The instructions also state to make a trading decision *after* generating knowledge.\n\nI will explicitly state my first action is to deny, and then my second action is my trade offer.\n\nFinal thought on the current offer: \"2 Brick, 3 Wheat -> 3 Ore\"\nMy total value: 1053\nIf I accepted this trade, my new quantities would be:\nWheat: 10 - 3 (given) + 3 (got from their offer) = 10 No Wheat given up for this. Wait. Their offer is 2 Brick, 3 Wheat -> 3 Ore.\nThey offer: 2 Brick, 3 Wheat. I give: 3 Ore.\nMy current: W:10, W:7, S:6, B:20, O:8\nAfter accepting: Wheat: 10 + 3 = 13 // From receiving 3 Wheat\nWood: 7\nSheep: 6\nBrick: 20 + 2 = 22 // From receiving 2 Brick\nOre: 8 - 3 = 5 // From giving 3 Ore\n\nValue check of accepting:\nCurrent Value: 1053\nValue of what I'd receive: 2 Brick (58) + 3 Wheat (18) = 76\nValue of what I'd give: 3 Ore (99)\nNet change: 76 - 99 = -23.\nNew total value: 1053 - 23 = 1030.\nThis is clearly bad. I must deny.\n\nAfter denying, I must make my own offer.\nMy chosen offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore.\nValue of what I offer (give): 3 Wheat * 6 = 18.\nValue of what I request (get): 1 Ore * 33 = 33.\nNet value change for me: +15. This is good.\n\nPlayer's turn is one action. I first have to respond to their offer.\nThe prompt asks \"After generating this knowledge, apply it to make your trading decision.\"\n\nMy trading decision is two parts: first response to offer, second my own offer.\nThe JSON format needs to reflect this. I should only provide *one* action.\nIn previous turns, after accepting an offer, the format was \"Player X accepted... Player X made no new offer.\"\nIf I *deny*, then I *can* make my own offer.\n\nI will formulate my trade.\nValue of Offer: 3 Wheat = 18\nValue of Request: 1 Ore = 33\nMy Gain = +15\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"offer\",\n  \"offer\": {\n    \"for_trade\": {\"Wheat\": 3},\n    \"wants\": {\"Ore\": 1}\n  }\n}\n```",

This is a strong resource for trading *away* if you can get something more valuable.\n    *   You have a good quantity of Sheep (10) and it has a moderate value per unit (12).\n    *   Ore has the highest value per unit (33) but you only have 6. Acquiring more Ore is likely a good strategy to increase total value.\n    *   Wheat has the lowest value per unit (6). Wood is also relatively low.

This trade *increased* your total value. (This previous action is important context for your current holdings, although the prompt provides your *current* holdings directly.

This means trading away resources where you have an abundance and/or low relative value for resources with high value per unit that you desire (like Ore).\n    *   **Identify undervalued resources for you:** Wheat (6), Wood (11).\n    *   **Identify overvalued resources for you (in terms of quantity):** Brick (29), Sheep (12).\n    *   **Identify desired resources:** Ore (33).\n    *   **Principle of Scarcity/Need:** Players will pay more for resources they need, especially if they are scarce. You have Brick, which other players might need for their goals. Ore is likely highly desired by everyone.\n    *   **Incremental Concession/Anchoring:** Start with an offer that favors you, and be prepared to concede slightly if the opponent counters. Avoid making drastic concessions immediately.\n    *   **Value-Based Trading:** Always calculate the value of both sides of a potential trade. Ensure `Value(Received) > Value(Offered)`. Aim for an increasing value ratio over time.\n    *   The current offer from Player 0 is bad for you. Reject it and make a counter-offer that aims to acquire Ore, ideally giving up resources you have in abundance.\n\nTrading Decision:\nThe offer from Player 0 (2 Brick, 3 Wheat -> 3 Ore) is clearly unfavorable, as you would lose 23 value (99 - 76). Reject this offer.\n\nBased on your current resources and values, you have a lot of Brick and Sheep. Ore is the most valuable resource. You want to acquire more Ore while giving up less valuable resources or resources you have in abundance.\n\nLet's propose a trade where we give up a mix of Brick and potentially some lower-value resources for Ore.\n\nConsider trading:\n*   2 Brick (2 * 29 = 58) + 2 Sheep (2 * 12 = 24) = 82 value.\n*   Request: 2 Ore (2 * 33 = 66) + 1 Wood (1 * 11 = 11) = 77 value. (This is a bad trade for you value-wise)\n\nLet's aim to simplify and target Ore directly. You have a lot of Brick.\nOffer: 2 Brick (58 value) + 2 Wheat (12 value) = 70 value.\nRequest: 2 Ore (66 value). This is close to even, slightly favorable to you.\n\nAlternatively, aim to get more Ore for your Brick.\nOffer: 3 Brick (3 * 29 = 87)\nRequest: 2 Ore (2 * 33 = 66). This is too much for you to give up.\n\nYou have 23 Brick. Player 0 previously offered 4 Sheep + 3 Brick for 2 Ore + 2 Wheat, which you accepted. This suggests Player 0 values Brick.\nLet's try to get Ore by giving up Brick and a little Sheep.\n\nMy offer:\nOffered: 2 Brick (58) + 1 Sheep (12) = 70\nRequested: 2 Ore (66)\n\nThis is a good offer for you, albeit only slightly. You are still gaining value by removing lower value items (Sheep) and high quantity items (Brick) for high value items (Ore).\n\nLet's try to be a bit more aggressive, considering the current unfavorable offer from P0.\nOffer: 3 Brick (3 * 29 = 87)\nRequest: 3 Ore (3 * 33 = 99)\n\nThis is a good offer for you. You give 87 value to gain 99 value. It's a clear increase in total value. Player 0 might accept since they showed interest in Brick.\n\nLet's try to get the most valuable resource you can for the large quantity of brick you have.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 3 Ore]",

      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\n\nKey Principles for Resource Trading and Negotiation:\n\n1. **Value Assessment**: Understand the value of resources you currently hold and the resources being traded. Focus on maximizing the increase in value with each trade.\n  \n2. **Supply and Demand**: Analyze what the other player might need. Trading what they want can yield better deals.\n\n3. **Negotiation Dynamics**: Be persistent but flexible. If an offer is rejected, consider the reasons why and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\n4. **Resource Duplication**: Ensure the resources you trade away are not core to your strategy unless the value gained significantly outweighs their importance.\n\n5. **Incremental Gains**: Aim for incremental value increases rather than seeking large changes in a single trade.\n\n### Current Situation Evaluation\n\nAfter the trade with Player 1, my resource amounts are adjusted, and I need to keep pushing for trades that lead to an increase in my overall resource value. I currently have the following resources:\n\n- **Wheat**: 13 (Value: 5)\n- **Wood**: 7 (Value: 8)\n- **Sheep**: 15 (after trade) (Value: 12)\n- **Brick**: 10 (after trade) (Value: 22)\n- **Ore**: 17 (after trade) (Value: 39)\n\nBefore making a new offer, I'll evaluate my resources against Player 1's potential needs based on previous interactions.\n\n### Analysis of Previous Offers\n\n- Player 1 has consistently shown interest in Ore, with trade offers focused around it. Therefore, trading Ore seems beneficial for acquiring Brick and potentially Wheat, as these resources have lower values but might incentivize Player 1 to trade. \n\n### Trading Decision\n\nTo keep negotiating with Player 1 effectively, let's consider a balanced offer to maintain our value while trying to receive resources that could be beneficial for future trades. \n\nGiven that Player 1 seems to want Ore, I will offer something more enticing while trying to keep the value balanced:\n\n#### New Offer\n**[Offer: 4 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Wheat]**\n\nThis offer seeks to maximize the value by using the Ore that Player 1 desires, obtaining Brick which might be useful for building/resourcing later, and Wheat which can be helpful sustaining resources. \n\n### Execute Action\nMaking the offer: \n**'[Offer: 4 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Wheat]'**",
