      "response": "### Generate Knowledge\nKey principles and strategies for resource trading and negotiation in this context:\n1. **Value Maximization Priority**: Prioritize trading resources with lower marginal value for those with higher marginal value per unit. Ore (35) and Brick (27) hold high value, while Wheat (5) and Wood (10) are low-value. Sheep (13) is mid-value but abundant.\n   \n2. **Leverage Abundance**: Trade surplus/low-value resources to conserve high-value ones. With 20 Wheat (only 5 value each) and 10 Wood (10 value), these are ideal \"sacrifices\" to offload. High-quantity Sheep (12) can also be partially traded without depleting utility.\n\n3. **Cost-Benefit Efficiency**: Focus on trades where the given resources' *total value lost* is less than the received resources' *total value gained*. Ideal offers should yield a net positive value delta (e.g., trading away low/mid-value resources for Ore/Brick).\n\n4. **Negotiation Psychology**: \n   - Bundle multiple low-value items into offers to make them appear more enticing (quantity illusion).\n   - Avoid over-requesting to reduce rejection risk (e.g., limit demands for Ore to \u22644 units per trade).\n   - Immediate gains matter\u2014don\u2019t wait for \"perfect\" trades early on when later opportunities may be scarcer.\n\n5. **Risk Mitigation**: \n   - Preserve minimum resource floors for potential future trades (e.g., keep \u22658 Sheep, 5 Wood). \n   - Target Ore first: it provides the highest value increase per unit (35), and we have room to grow our 14 units.\n\n### Apply Knowledge to Trading Decision\nCurrent value optimization focus:\n- **Weakness**: Wheat dominates inventory (40% of resources) but contributes only 8% of total value. Freeing Wheat capacity is urgent.\n- **Opportunity**: Ore\u2019s extreme value (35) makes it the primary target\u2014gaining 4 Ore adds 140 value, while losing 10 Wheat (50) + 3 Sheep (39) nets a +51 gain.\n- **Balance**: Offering Sheep adds appeal (it\u2019s moderate-value but plentiful), while keeping Wood preserves flexibility for unforeseen trades.\n\n**Action**:  \n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 3 Sheep -> 4 Ore]  \n\n- **Value Impact**:  \n  - Lose: 10\u00d75 (Wheat) + 3\u00d713 (Sheep) = 50 + 39 = 89  \n  - Gain: 4\u00d735 (Ore) = 140  \n  - **Net Value Change**: +51  \n- **Resource Impacts**:  \n  - Wheat: 20 - 10 = 10 (still ample)  \n  - Sheep: 12 - 3 = 9 (above safety floor)  \n  - Ore: 14 + 4 = 18 (maximizes value concentration)  \n\nThis trade prioritizes value lift, preserves negotiation flexibility, and uses abundant resources strategically. If rejected, we'll pivot to Brick-focused offers next turn.",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge\nI am Player 0, aiming to maximize the total value of my resources through trading. Based on my current resource valuations and the context of negotiation, the following key principles and strategies apply:\n\n1. **Value Maximization Priority**: Target trades that increase my total value by acquiring higher-value resources (Brick at 27 and Ore at 35) in exchange for lower-value ones (Wheat at 5, Wood at 10, or Sheep at 13). This leverages diminishing marginal utility\u2014trading surplus low-value items for scarce high-value items boosts net worth.\n   \n2. **Adjusting After Rejection**: Player 1 rejected my previous offer of 10 Wheat (low value) and 3 Sheep (medium value) for 4 Ore (high value). Reasons could include Player 1 overvaluing Ore, undervaluing my offered resources, or seeking better terms. I must now refine my approach by:\n   - Offering a different resource mix to test Player 1's preferences.\n   - Avoiding overly aggressive proposals (e.g., requesting fewer high-value units or sweetening the offer).\n   - Shifting focus to Brick (high value but lower than Ore) to maintain progress if Ore trades are resisted.\n\n3. **Risk and Efficiency**: Don't deplete resources excessively (e.g., Wheat is abundant at 20, so trading it preserves value). Prioritize resource combinations with the highest value disparity for gains:\n   - Best case: Trade Wheat (5) or Wood (10) for Ore (35) or Brick (27).\n   - Avoid trading Brick or Ore unless for disproportionate Ore gains (which is not currently feasible).\n\n4. **Negotiation Dynamics**: Since Player 1 didn't counter-offer, they may be hesitant or have unknown valuations. Build rapport by offering a \"safer\" trade\u2014moderate resources for moderate returns\u2014to encourage acceptance. With 10 turns total, I have flexibility to iterate.\n\n### Trading Decision\nGiven the above, I will adjust my strategy:\n- **New target**: Brick (value 27), as Ore trades faced resistance. Trading for Brick still provides value growth with potentially lower barriers.\n- **New offer**: Propose 10 Wheat (my lowest-value resource) and 2 Sheep (medium-value) for 3 Brick. This is a cautious, mutually reasonable trade:\n  - My value sacrificed: (10 \u00d7 5) + (2 \u00d7 13) = 50 + 26 = 76.\n  - My value gained: 3 \u00d7 27 = 81.\n  - Net gain: +5, increasing total value without overreaching.\n- **Why this could work**: Player 1 may value Wheat/Sheep more highly (e.g., for their own needs), making this appealing despite my gain.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick]",

Constructing a counter-offer  \n   Observation: the opponent currently wants **Brick** and is dangling Wheat/Sheep as payment.  \n   However, you yourself are short of Brick (16), so giving Brick seldom makes sense.  \n   Instead, shift the negotiation toward providing **Wood/Wheat/Sheep** for **Brick**.  \n   The opponent\u2019s marginal valuations are unknown, but we can gauge by their overlapped bids:\n\n   (a) In the earlier rejected bid they offered 10 Wheat + 3 Sheep for 4 Ore \u2013 signalling they perceive Ore as extremely valuable.  \n   (b) Now they are offering 10 Wheat + 2 Sheep for 3 Brick \u2013 signalling they value Brick at roughly the combined value of (10 Wheat + 2 Sheep).\n\n   We do not want to part with Brick, but we can try to *sell* our excess Wheat (23) or Sheep (18) to obtain more Brick that way.\n\n   Candidate counter:  \n        I receive 3 Brick (worth 63)  \n        I give 6 Wheat (worth 36)  \n        Net gain: +27\n\n   If they balk, increase Wheat offered, but never exceed marginal break-even (6.34 Wheat \u2248 parity with 21 per Brick), so you will have ample room to grow the Wheat portion without sacrificing value.\n\nApplied Decision:\n\n[Deny]",

We must deny this offer and strategize future trades focusing on:  \n- Offloading **Wheat/Wood** for **Brick/Ore**.  \n- Avoiding overcommitting **Brick/Sheep**.\n\n**Action**: [Deny]",

      "response": "### Generated Knowledge: Relevant Trading Principles and Strategies\n1. **Value Maximization Focus**: Prioritize trades that increase your total resource value by acquiring higher-value resources (like Brick and Ore) while offloading lower-value ones (Wheat, Wood, Sheep). Given your valuations:  \n   - **High-value resources**: Brick (27) and Ore (35)  \n   - **Medium-value resource**: Sheep (13)  \n   - **Low-value resources**: Wheat (5) and Wood (10)  \n   Trade away Wheat/Wood/Sheep for Brick/Ore to net positive value gains.\n\n2. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**:  \n   - You have excess Wheat (20) and surplus Sheep (12), making them ideal for trading.  \n   - Brick (14) is highly valuable but limited\u2014conserve it unless gaining a substantial net value increase.  \n   - Player 1 consistently rejects your offers for Brick/Ore, indicating they undervalue Wheat/Sheep or overvalue their resources.\n\n3. **Observed Player 1 Behavior**:  \n   - Player 1 rejected offers like 10 Wheat + 3 Sheep \u2192 4 Ore and 10 Wheat + 2 Sheep \u2192 3 Brick, suggesting disinterest in Wheat/Sheep.  \n   - Player 1 proposed exploitative offers (e.g., 3 Sheep + 2 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 2 Sheep and 5 Sheep + 4 Wheat \u2192 7 Brick), which **heavily favor them** by targeting your high-value Brick.  \n   - Trust deficit: Player 1\u2019s offers consistently demand excessive Brick for low-value returns, warranting skepticism.\n\n4. **Negotiation Tactics**:  \n   - **Avoid value-losing trades**: Accept only if net value increases; reject \"rip-off\" offers (e.g., trading high-value Brick for Wheat/Sheep).  \n   - **Counter strategically**: If rejecting, propose a revised offer that benefits you while being palatable to Player 1 (e.g., Wheat/Sheep for Ore at fair ratios).  \n   - **Turn efficiency**: With 10 total turns and 9 already completed, this is likely the final move. Prioritize a safe rejection if the offer is poor.\n\n5. **Risk Mitigation**:  \n   - Preserve Brick (high scarcity-to-value ratio) and Ore unless gaining a significant advantage.  \n   - Wheat is your least valuable resource\u2014use it as leverage but avoid overpaying with Sheep.  \n\n### Trading Decision  \nPlayer 1's current offer:  \n- **Offering**: 5 Sheep (value: 5 \u00d7 13 = 65) + 4 Wheat (value: 4 \u00d7 5 = 20) \u2192 Total offered value = **85**  \n- **Requesting**: 7 Brick (value: 7 \u00d7 27 = 189)  \n\n**Net Value Impact**:  \n- If accepted, you **lose** 189 - 85 = **104 value** (14.5% decrease from your total value).  \n- This is exploitative and aligns with Player 1\u2019s pattern of demanding Brick at unfair rates.  \n\n**Action**:  \n- Reject this offer immediately. It reduces your value significantly and misuses your critical Brick surplus.  \n- Since this is likely the final turn (turn 10), prioritize avoiding value loss over making a new offer.  \n\n**[Deny]**",
