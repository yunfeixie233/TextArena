      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This means I should always aim for trades where the value of resources received is greater than the value of resources offered.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** I have a clear understanding of my resource values. This is crucial for evaluating potential trades.\n    *   Wheat: 5\n    *   Wood: 11\n    *   Sheep: 18\n    *   Brick: 22\n    *   Ore: 34\n3.  **High-Value Resources:** Ore (34) and Brick (22) are my highest value resources. Sheep (18) is mid-to-high. Wood (11) is mid-to-low. Wheat (5) is my lowest value. I should be cautious about trading away high-value resources unless I get a significant return, and look to trade low-value resources for higher-value ones.\n4.  **Resource Abundance:** I have large quantities of Wheat (21) and Sheep (18). These are good candidates for offering in trades, especially Wheat, which is also my lowest value resource. My quantities of Wood (7), Brick (10), and Ore (7) are more moderate. Trading away too much of a moderate quantity resource might limit future trading options.\n5.  **Negotiation Strategy - Initial Offers:**\n    *   Start with offers that are clearly beneficial to me, but not so aggressive that the other player immediately denies.\n    *   Prioritize trading away low-value, abundant resources (Wheat, Sheep) for high-value resources (Ore, Brick).\n    *   Consider offering a mix of resources if it helps balance the trade for both parties, but always ensure my gain is positive.\n    *   It's generally better to offer more low-value resources for fewer high-value resources.\n6.  **Identifying Good Trades:** A good trade for me would involve:\n    *   Giving up Wheat for almost anything else.\n    *   Giving up Sheep for Brick or Ore, especially if I can get a good ratio.\n    *   Getting Ore or Brick.\n    *   Avoiding trades where I give up high-value resources (Ore, Brick) for significantly less value.\n7.  **Future Considerations/Turns:** This is turn 1. I have 10 turns. I don't need to make the *perfect* trade immediately, but I should aim for a significant value increase. I can learn from the other player's responses.\n\nApply Knowledge to Trading Decision:\nMy goal is to increase total value. Wheat is my lowest value and most abundant resource. Ore and Brick are my highest value resources. I want to convert low-value holdings into high-value holdings.\n\nLet's look at some potential exchanges:\n*   Trading Wheat for Brick: Wheat is 5, Brick is 22. Roughly 4-5 Wheat for 1 Brick. I have 21 Wheat.\n*   Trading Wheat for Ore: Wheat is 5, Ore is 34. Roughly 6-7 Wheat for 1 Ore.\n\nI have a lot of Sheep (18) at a value of 18. This is a good mid-tier resource. I could offer Sheep for Brick or Ore.\n*   Sheep (18) for Brick (22): 1 Sheep isn't quite 1 Brick. Maybe 3 Sheep (54) for 2 Brick (44)? No, that's not good for me. How about 2 Sheep (36) for 1 Brick (22) and 1 Wood (11) = 33? Still not great.\n*   Sheep (18) for Ore (34): 2 Sheep (36) for 1 Ore (34) is almost a 1:1 value trade, but I lose 2 value. Maybe 3 Sheep (54) for 1 Ore (34) and 1 Brick (22)? Value received is 56, value offered is 54. This is good!\n\nMy most liquid resource combination for gaining value is to offer Wheat/Sheep.\n\nLet's try to get Ore, as it's the highest value.\nI have 21 Wheat. If I offer 6 Wheat (30 value) for 1 Ore (34 value), I gain 4 value. This is a very reasonable offer. The other player gets a moderate amount of common resource for one of their high-value, possibly less common, resources.\n\nLet's try to get Brick.\nIf I offer 4 Wheat (20 value) for 1 Brick (22 value), I gain 2 value. Also good.\n\nGiven that it's turn 1, I want to make a clear offer that benefits me but isn't overly aggressive.\nA trade of 6 Wheat for 1 Ore offers a good value gain (34-30 = +4) and uses my most abundant, lowest-value resource.\n\n[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

The goal is to trade resources that are less valuable to you for those that are more valuable or useful in your strategy.\n\n2. **Demand and Supply Dynamics**: Observing what others need and what they are offering can give you leverage. For example, if someone has a high demand for a resource you have in abundance, it can increase your bargaining power.\n\n3. **Negotiation Strategies**: \n   - Use **incremental bargaining** where you offer more and adjust based on the responses of the other player.\n   - Make trade offers that result in a **win-win situation** for both parties, thereby increasing the likelihood of acceptance.\n   - Consider the **utility and scarcity** of items.

This allows for quick calculation of trade profitability.\n3.  **Surplus Identification:** I have a large quantity of Wheat (21) and Sheep (18). These are good candidates for offering in trades, especially if I can get higher-value resources in return.\n4.  **Scarcity and Demand:** My quantities of Wood, Brick, and Ore are lower. Ore (value 34) is my most valuable resource per unit, making it a good target to acquire. Brick (value 22) is also valuable and I only have 10.\n5.  **Previous Turn Analysis:** My last offer (6 Wheat -> 1 Ore) was rejected. This tells me Player 1 likely values Ore highly (or my offer was too low for them). 6 Wheat is valued at 30, and 1 Ore is valued at 34. While positive for me, perhaps Player 1 found it insufficient.\n6.  **Negotiation Strategy:**\n    *   Start with offers that are clearly beneficial to me but still reasonable for the other player.\n    *   Monitor rejections to understand what the other player values or considers a fair trade.\n    *   Be willing to adjust offers if initial ones are rejected, perhaps by offering more of my lower-value resources or asking for less of a high-value resource.\n    *   Consider offering a mix of resources to make a deal more appealing, or requesting a mix if I have multiple needs.\n    *   Avoid trades that decrease my total value.\n    *   It's early in the game (turn 1 out of 10), so I have time to explore different offers and learn Player 1's preferences.\n\nNew Trade Offer:\nMy previous offer of 6 Wheat (30 value) for 1 Ore (34 value) was rejected. Player 1 might value their Ore more or deemed my offer insufficient. I have a lot of Wheat. I will try to offer more Wheat to get Ore, or try to get Brick which is also high value. I want to clear some Wheat.\n\nLet's try:\n*   Option 1: Increase Wheat offer for Ore. 7 Wheat (35 value) for 1 Ore (34 value). This is still beneficial for me. It shows I'm willing to give more but still not overpaying.\n*   Option 2: Offer Wheat for Brick. 5 Wheat (25 value) for 1 Brick (22 value). This is also profitable and helps me get rid of Wheat.\n*   Option 3: Offer a mix for high-value resource.\n\nGiven the rejection of 6 Wheat for 1 Ore, Player 1 likely values Ore higher than 34, or perceives 6 Wheat as too little. I will try to offer a more substantial amount of my surplus Wheat for Ore, as Ore is my highest value resource. Let's try to offer 8 Wheat (40 value) for 1 Ore (34 value). This is very beneficial for me, but it's an even better offer for Player 1 than my previous one, so hopefully more appealing.\n\n[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This means I should always aim for trades where (value of requested resources) > (value of offered resources).\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** I have an explicit value for each resource. I should use these values to quantify the worth of any proposed trade. My current total value is (21*5) + (7*11) + (18*18) + (10*22) + (7*34) = 105 + 77 + 324 + 220 + 238 = 964.\n3.  **Scarcity/Abundance:** I have a lot of Wheat (21) and Sheep (18), and relatively less Wood (7), Brick (10), and Ore (7). This means I can more readily offer Wheat and Sheep, and should be more cautious about offering Wood, Brick, or Ore unless the gain is significant. Given the previous rejections, Player 1 is likely not interested in my surplus Wheat at the rate I'm offering.\n4.  **Trade Efficiency:** Aim for trades that yield a high return on investment. For example, trading low-value resources for high-value resources is ideal.\n5.  **Player 1's Behavior:** Player 1 has rejected my previous offers of 6 Wheat for 1 Ore (value: 30 vs 34) and 8 Wheat for 1 Ore (value: 40 vs 34). This suggests Player 1 either values Wheat highly for some reason (perhaps they have very little) or they value Ore even more highly than its listed value, or they are trying to get an even better deal from me. My previous offers were slightly unfavorable to me (40 value given for 34 value received), but I was trying to get rid of surplus Wheat for a high-value resource. Player 1's rejection of an offer that was already somewhat in their favor (8 Wheat for 1 Ore) suggests they are either very shrewd, they don't *need* Wheat, or they perceive Ore as extremely valuable.\n6.  **Negotiation Strategy:**\n    *   **Propose Beneficial Trades:** My offers should always increase my total value.\n    *   **Understand Opponent's Needs (Hypothesize):** Player 1 might be short on a resource I have in abundance, or they might value a specific resource differently. Since they rejected 8 Wheat for 1 Ore, perhaps they don't need Wheat, or they have a surplus of Ore and want something else.\n    *   **Flexibility:** Don't get stuck on one type of trade. If Player 1 isn't biting on Wheat for Ore, I need to try a different resource combination or adjust the ratios significantly.\n    *   **Gradual Adjustment:** If an offer is rejected, try to understand *why*. Was the ratio bad for them? Did they not need the resource? My previous offers were becoming *less* favorable to me, yet they were still rejected. This implies either my initial valuation of my offer was too low for Player 1, or they simply weren't interested in Wheat for Ore.\n    *   **Reciprocity:** Player 1 has made no offers, which puts the onus on me to initiate.\n\nGiven Player 1's rejections of Wheat for Ore, I need to assume they either don't need Wheat or they want a much better deal for their Ore. I have a lot of Sheep, which is also a medium-value resource. Maybe Player 1 needs Sheep, or Brick, or Wood. Since Ore is very valuable, getting it is still a priority, but I need to offer something more appealing to Player 1, or offer less of my high-value resources.\n\nMy current high quantity resources are Wheat (21) and Sheep (18). My high value resources are Ore (34) and Brick (22).\n\nStrategy shift: Instead of trying to offload Wheat for Ore, let's try to offload Sheep for something valuable. Or, consider giving up some lower value resources for a premium on a high value one.\n\nWhat if Player 1 needs Brick? I have 10 Brick. What if I offer multiple low-value items for one high-value item?\n\nLet's re-evaluate the rejected trades:\n*   6 Wheat (30) -> 1 Ore (34). Player 1 rejected.\n*   8 Wheat (40) -> 1 Ore (34). Player 1 rejected.\n\nPlayer 1 consistently rejected offers where they would get a higher value from me in exchange for 1 Ore, or a slightly lower value. This is highly unusual behavior for trying to maximize value. This suggests either:\n1.  Player 1 has a *huge* surplus of Ore.\n2.  Player 1 has a *huge* need for Wheat (unlikely, as they rejected my increasing Wheat offers).\n3.  Player 1 does not want to trade Ore at all, regardless of the offer.\n4.  Player 1 has a different, unstated objective or valuation.\n\nI need to diversify my offer. Since Player 1 rejected offers of Wheat for Ore, I should try offering a different resource for Ore, or offer Wheat for a different valuable resource (like Brick).\n\nWhat if I try to get something from Player 1 that I don't have much of, like more Wood or Brick, or even more Ore?\n\nLet's try to offer a mix of my abundant resources for a high-value resource. Or, try to get a medium-value resource for a low-value one.\nI have plenty of Wheat (21) and Sheep (18).\nIf I offer Sheep for Ore, what would be a good deal for me? 18 value for 34 value. I'd need to give 2 Sheep (36 value) for 1 Ore (34 value). This is slightly unfavorable to me.\nWhat if I offer a mix? Say, Wheat + Sheep for Ore?\n\nGiven the prior rejections of Wheat for Ore, I suspect Player 1 is not interested in Wheat, or wants an outrageous deal for Ore. I should avoid offering Wheat for Ore for now.\n\nLet's consider trading Sheep. I have 18 Sheep.\n*   Trade Sheep for Brick: 1 Sheep (18) vs 1 Brick (22). I give 18, get 22. Good deal.\n*   Trade Wheat for Brick: 1 Wheat (5) vs 1 Brick (22). I'd need to give 4 Wheat (20) for 1 Brick (22). Good deal.\n\nIf Player 1 doesn't want Wheat, perhaps they want Sheep or something else.\nIt's unlikely Player 1 wants even more Ore if they're not trading it.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 is holding out for a very good deal. If I want Ore, I will likely have to overpay.\nGiven I have so much Wheat and Sheep, I can afford to use them as currency for higher-value items.\n\nConsider my most valuable items: Ore (34), Brick (22).\nMy least valuable: Wheat (5), Wood (11).\n\nPerhaps Player 1 needs Wood? I have 7 Wood.\n\nMy last two offers failed, and they were progressively worse for me: 6 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (34); 8 Wheat (40) for 1 Ore (34). I increased the *cost* to me in the second offer, making it even more tempting while keeping the value *received* constant. Player 1 rejected both. This is strong evidence that Player 1 *does not want Wheat* (or values it extremely low) or *does not want to part with Ore*.\n\nNew approach:\n1.  Try to acquire a different valuable resource (Brick).\n2.  Use my most abundant resources (Sheep) as leverage, since Wheat seems to be a non-starter.\n3.  Ensure the trade is net positive for me.\n\nLet's try to get Brick from Player 1.\nI offer: 2 Sheep (Value 36) -> 2 Brick (Value 44). This is a good deal for me.\nWhat if Player 1 has low Brick?\n\nWhat if I offer a resource that is not Wheat or Ore?\nMaybe Player 1 needs Wood. I have only 7. What about Brick? I have 10.\nI need to offer something to get something valuable.\n\nLet's assume Player 1 is playing a long game or has a specific goal in mind.\nI'll try to trade my highly valued resources for something *more* valuable.\n\nIf I offer 2 Sheep (36 value) for 1 Ore (34 value), Player 1 might accept. But it's a net loss for me. I should avoid that.\nI need a trade that has positive value for me.\n\nMy goal is to increase total value.\nWhat if I offer a mix of low-value and medium-value items for a high-value item?\n\nLet's try:\nOffer: 3 Sheep (18*3 = 54)\nRequest: 2 Brick (22*2 = 44) + 1 Wood (11) = 55 value.\nThis is a good trade for me, value 54 given for 55 received. Plus, I reduce my high Sheep quantity and gain various resources.\nThis might be more appealing to Player 1 as it diversifies the items they receive.\n\nLet's consider Player 1's side. If Player 1 has a lot of Brick and Wood, they might not need this.\nIf my Wheat offers were rejected, maybe my Sheep offers will also be rejected.\nWhat if Player 1 has a very specific need or wants extremely favorable terms?\n\nThink about what Player 1 is *not* rejecting. They have not made any offers.\n\nPerhaps Player 1 wants *many* resources for one of theirs.\nLet's make a very simple, slightly favorable offer for me, using my surplus sheep.\n\nOffer: 2 Sheep (36 value) -> 1 Ore (34 value). This is a *loss* of 2 value for me. I should not do this.\nOffer: 2 Sheep (36 value) -> 2 Brick (44 value). This is an 8 value gain for me.\n\nGiven the previous rejections, I should reconsider my strategy. Player 1 is not taking Wheat for Ore.\nWhat if I try to get *rid* of my high-value Ore for an even higher aggregate value?\nNo, my objective is to *increase* total value. Selling high-value assets should only happen if I get an even higher aggregate value return.\n\nI need to be patient, but also proactive.\nMy last two offers were Wheat for Ore. Both rejected.\nMaybe Player 1 has plenty of Ore and doesn't want Wheat.\nPerhaps Player 1 needs a lot of my Sheep?\n\nLet's try a different strategy: Offer a large quantity of a low-value item for a medium-value one.\nE.g., 5 Wheat (25) -> 1 Wood (11). Loss. Bad.\n4 Wheat (20) -> 1 Brick (22). Good for me (+2). Player 1 might need Brick, and 4 Wheat could be useful.\n\nThis seems like a more reasonable next step than trying to force Wheat for Ore again, or getting rid of my high-value Ore.\n\nDecision:\nI will offer 4 Wheat for 1 Brick. This is a clear value increase for me (20 vs 22), I get rid of some surplus Wheat, and potentially acquire a resource Player 1 needs more (Brick vs. Ore, which Player 1 seems reluctant to trade).\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]\nValue Offered: 4 * 5 = 20\nValue Requested: 1 * 22 = 22\nNet Gain: +2",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This means I should aim for trades where the value of resources I give up is less than the value of resources I receive.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:** I have a clear value for each resource. I can calculate the value of any proposed trade. My current total value is (21*5) + (7*11) + (18*18) + (10*22) + (7*34) = 105 + 77 + 324 + 220 + 238 = 964.\n3.  **Low-Value Resource Utilization:** Wheat has the lowest individual value (5). I have a large quantity of it (21). It's a good candidate for offering in trades, especially for higher-value resources.\n4.  **High-Value Resource Acquisition:** Ore (34) and Brick (22) are my highest value resources. Acquiring more of these, even at a seemingly \"bad\" ratio, can be beneficial if the net value gain is positive.\n5.  **Understanding Past Rejections:** Player 1 rejected offers of 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore, and 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick. This indicates Player 1 either values Wheat highly, values Ore/Brick even higher, or doesn't have the requested resources to spare for my offers, or they are trying to get more for their resources. Player 1 seems unwilling to trade Ore for any reasonable amount of Wheat, or Brick for 4 Wheat.\n    *   6 Wheat (30) < 1 Ore (34) - Good for me, bad for P1. Expected rejection.\n    *   8 Wheat (40) > 1 Ore (34) - Bad for me net value, but still rejected. P1 is probably trying to get more or doesn't need Wheat. This was a bad offer to make.\n    *   4 Wheat (20) < 1 Brick (22) - Good for me, bad for P1. Expected rejection.\n6.  **Information Asymmetry:** I don't know Player 1's resource quantities or their internal valuations, which might differ from mine if they have different objectives or resource needs.\n7.  **Negotiation Strategy:**\n    *   **Start with offers slightly favorable to me but not outrageously so.** My previous offers were too stingy from P1's perspective (6W->1O, 4W->1B) or too generous from my perspective (8W->1O).\n    *   **Be willing to offer more of my low-value resources for less of high-value resources, as long as the net value calculation is positive for me.**\n    *   **Consider offering diversified resources:** Maybe Player 1 needs something other than just Wheat.\n    *   **Identify what Player 1 might need by observing their rejections.** They've rejected my requests for Ore and Brick. This might mean they also value these resources highly or have a surplus of Wheat.\n    *   Since Player 1 hasn't made any offers, I need to continue to initiate and try to find a mutually beneficial trade. They seem to value their high-value resources. I need to sweeten the deal for them, but still ensure a net gain for me.\n\nMy goal remains increasing total value. Given the rejections, I need to rethink my offers. Maybe Player 1 has a lot of Wheat or values it very little. Or they desperately need something I have in a small quantity (like Ore, Brick, or Wood themselves). I should *not* offer 8 Wheat for 1 Ore again, as that was a net loss for me.\n\nNew approach:\n*   Try a more balanced trade from Player 1's perspective, but still net positive for me.\n*   Target resources where I have a surplus (Wheat, Sheep) to get resources I want (Ore, Brick, Wood, perhaps even Sheep if I get sufficient value).\n*   Given Player 1's rejections for Ore/Brick, I might need to offer more value to get them.\n\nLet's re-evaluate potential trades:\n*   My current total value: 964.\n*   I want trades that increase this.\n\nPrevious failed attempts:\n*   6 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (34) - P1 rejected (P1 loses 4 value).\n*   8 Wheat (40) for 1 Ore (34) - P1 rejected (I lose 6 value, so this was a bad offer).\n*   4 Wheat (20) for 1 Brick (22) - P1 rejected (P1 loses 2 value).\n\nPlayer 1 is not accepting negative value trades for them. I need to make an offer where P1 gets a perceived positive value or at least perceived neutral, while I also gain value.\n\nConsider trading Wheat for Wood: Wheat (5), Wood (11).\nMaybe 3 Wheat (15) for 1 Wood (11) if P1 needs Wheat badly? (I lose 4, P1 gains 4). No, this is bad for me.\nHow about 1 Wood (11) for 3 Wheat (15)? (I gain 4 value, P1 loses 4 value). Unlikely P1 accepts if they rejected 6W for 1O.\n\nPlayer 1 has rejected all my previous offers where they would lose value. This implies they are playing to maximize their own value as well or are very savvy. I will need to offer something where they perceive value for themselves, but I gain more.\n\nLet's target Ore again, as it's the highest value. But I need to offer more.\nIf I offer 7 Wheat (35) for 1 Ore (34). I gain 34 - 35 = -1 value. Not good.\nWhat if I offer a mix of low-value resources?\nWhat if I offer something else to get Brick?\nMy 10 Brick (value 220). My 7 Ore (value 238).\n\nI am willing to give up a little more value to get high-value resources if it clears up my weaker resources.\nLet's try bundling.\n\nWhat does Player 1 have that they didn't offer? They haven't offered anything.\nThey didn't counter-offer. This means they are either hoping I offer something even better for them, or they truly don't need what I'm offering.\n\nI have 21 Wheat (low value, high quantity).\nI have 18 Sheep (medium value, high quantity).\n\nLet's try to get more Brick. It's the second highest.\n4 Wheat (20) for 1 Brick (22) was rejected.\nWhat about breaking even from P1's perspective? 4.4 Wheat for 1 Brick.\nSo I will need to offer something like 5 Wheat (25) for 1 Brick (22). I lose 3 value. Not good.\n\nPerhaps I should offer something more valuable to *them* that I have a surplus of, to get something truly valuable for me.\nI have a LOT of Sheep (18 at 18 value). Total 324.\nPerhaps Player 1 needs Sheep, or Brick?\n\nWhat if I offer 1 Sheep (18) and a few Wheat (say 2W = 10) for 1 Brick (22)?\nTotal offer: 1 Sheep (18) + 2 Wheat (10) = 28 value.\nReceive: 1 Brick (22) = 22 value.\nNet change for me: 22 - 28 = -6. Bad trade.\n\nI clearly need to gain value. Player 1 will not accept a trade where they lose value.\nI need to find a trade where I gain value, and Player 1 at least doesn't lose much value, or ideally gains some themselves. Since they rejected my \"bad for them\" offers, that part is key.\n\nMy available resources:\n+ [Wheat] Qty: 21 Value: 5\n+ [Wood] Qty: 7 Value: 11\n+ [Sheep] Qty: 18 Value: 18\n+ [Brick] Qty: 10 Value: 22\n+ [Ore] Qty: 7 Value: 34\n\nConsider a trade that is almost symmetrical in value, but gives me a high-value resource.\nFor 1 Ore (34 value):\n    - Could I offer 2 Sheep (36 value)? I lose 2 value. Not good.\n    - Could I offer 1 Sheep (18) and 3 Wheat (15)? Total 33. I lose 1 value. Not good.\n\nThis is tough. Player 1's continued rejections mean they're not desperate, or they are very strategic. I cannot make offers that cause me to lose value.\n\nLet's try to give up more Wheat and Sheep, which I have in quantity, for a single higher value item.\nI have 21 Wheat (105 value), 18 Sheep (324 value). Total low-to-mid value resources.\n\nWhat if I target Wood? While not the highest value item, it's better than Wheat.\n1 Wood (11).\nCould I offer 2 Wheat (10) for 1 Wood (11)? My value up by 1. Player 1 loses 1. Rejected previously?\nThis wasn't offered specifically. My previous offers were specifically for Ore or Brick.\nThis is a small gain for me, small loss for P1. Maybe acceptable?\n\nIf Player 1 rejected 4 Wheat (20) for 1 Brick (22), where P1 lost 2 value, then 2 Wheat (10) for 1 Wood (11), where P1 loses 1 value, might still be rejected.\n\nWhat if Player 1 is holding out for Ore/Brick from *me*?\nI won't offer Ore/Brick for anything less than significant gains myself.\n\nLet's consider a trade where I offer a slightly higher total value, IF I also gain a resource that is individually high value.\nE.g., I offer 6 Wheat (30) + 1 Wood (11) = 41. Receive 1 Ore (34). No, this is bad for me. I lose 7 value.\n\nI must gain value. Player 1 has rejected offers that cause them to lose value.\nThis implies I need to make an offer where:\n1. I get a net value *gain*.\n2. Player 1 gets a net value *gain* or *neutral*.\n\nHow could Player 1 gain value if I also gain value?\nThis is only possible if our individual resource valuations are different. But the prompt specifies the values:\n+ [Wheat] Qty: 21 Value: 5\n+ [Wood] Qty: 7 Value: 11\n+ [Sheep] Qty: 18 Value: 18\n+ [Brick] Qty: 10 Value: 22\n+ [Ore] Qty: 7 Value: 34\n\nSince both players use the same valuation, my gain is always P1's loss and vice versa, if exchanging equal quantities.\nSo, the premise that \"Player 1 gets a net value gain or neutral\" while \"I get a net value gain\" is impossible with these fixed valuations.\n\nTherefore, Player 1's rejections imply one of two things:\n1. They are also playing to increase their total value, and will reject any trade that makes *them* lose value.\n2. They do not have the requested resource, or not enough.\n\nGiven the rejections, Player 1 seems to be preventing *their* total value from decreasing. They are not accepting offers where they *give* higher value than they *receive*.\n\nI need to make an offer where I RECEIVE more value than I GIVE. This means Player 1 will LOSE value. The previous rejections indicate P1 will not accept this.\n\nIs there a way for me to gain value but P1 to somehow also \"gain\" something not reflected in current value? No, the game is about total resource value.\n\nThis means the previous strategy was correct, I tried to get a positive value trade for myself. P1 rejected.\nThis indicates P1 will only accept trades where they don't lose value, or they are trying to get an even better deal.\n\nI need to either:\nA. Offer a trade that is *more* fair (closer to 1:1 value-wise) but still slightly in my favor.\nB. Try to get a high quantity of low-value resources for a low quantity of high-value resources, where the value per unit is still very good for me.\n\nLet's try to get Ore again. It's the most valuable.\nIf I offer 7 Wheat (35) for 1 Ore (34), I lose 1 value. BAD.\nIf I offer 6 Wheat (30) for 1 Ore (34), rejected. I gain 4. P1 lost 4.\nI need to offer more so that P1 loses LESS. But I still need to gain. This seems impossible if P1 has the same value function.\n\nThe only way I can gain value is if Player 1 *loses* value.\nPlayer 1 has rejected all offers that made them lose value:\nOffer 1: 6 Wheat (30) -> 1 Ore (34). I gain 4, P1 loses 4. Rejected.\nOffer 2: 8 Wheat (40) -> 1 Ore (34). I lose 6, P1 gains 6. I shouldn't have made this offer.\nOffer 3: 4 Wheat (20) -> 1 Brick (22). I gain 2, P1 loses 2. Rejected.\n\nPlayer 1 will NOT accept offers where they lose value. This is consistent.\nSo if I want to make a trade, I must accept a trade where I lose value, or make a trade that is perfectly value-neutral (no gain, no loss). Since my objective is to *increase* total value, I cannot accept these.\n\nThis implies Player 1 is being too aggressive, or I need to find a different type of trade.\nPerhaps Player 1 has a large quantity of something they value very little?\n\nI am Player 0. It is currently my turn to make an offer.\nI am stuck in a negotiation deadlock if Player 1 always rejects trades where they lose value, and I must gain value.\nDoes this imply I should aim for a trade that is value-neutral for me, but maybe gives me certain *types* of resources? No, the goal is total value increase.\n\nIs there any advantage to having certain *types* of resources? Only their value. Not mentioned otherwise.\n\nWhat if I offer a large quantity of Wheat for a resource.\nI have 21 Wheat.\nWhat if I offer 15 Wheat (75) to get 2 Ore (68)? I lose 7. Bad.\n\nOkay, let's assume P1 will accept a trade where they lose very little value, say 1 unit.\nIf I offer 5 Wheat (25) for 1 Brick (22), I lose 3. Bad.\nIf I offer 4 Wheat (20) for 1 Brick (22), P1 loses 2. Rejected.\nWhat if I offer exactly 4.4 Wheat? Not possible.\n\nThis means I need Player 1 to make an offer OR I need to adjust my expectation.\n\nI *must* make an offer in this turn.\nIf Player 1 won't accept a trade where they lose value and I gain value, then I can't fulfill my objective of increasing total value through trade.\nUnless:\n1. Their valuation is different (not indicated).\n2. They are bluffing and might accept a small loss in value.\n3. They prioritize something other than total value (not indicated).\n\nGiven they haven't made *any* offers either, they intend for me to keep making offers until I make one that benefits *them*, or is neutral for them.\n\nLet's try a different resource I've not targeted much before. Wood.\nI have 7 Wood. Value 11.\nIf I offer 2 Wheat (10) for 1 Wood (11). I gain 1 value. P1 loses 1 value.\nThis is the smallest loss I can impose on Player 1 while still gaining value myself.\nPrevious rejections: -4, -2. So -1 *might* be accepted. It's a gamble, but the smallest step.\n\nLet's try a trade for Sheep. My Sheep are valued at 18.\nIf I offer 3 Wheat (15) for 1 Sheep (18). I gain 3. P1 loses 3. Doubtful.\n\nMy strategy must be to offer the *smallest possible positive value trade for me* that Player 1 *might* accept, given their past behavior.\n\nThe smallest positive value trade for me is 1 value gain.\nThis happens if I give 10 value and get 11 value back.\nExample: Give 2 Wheat (10) for 1 Wood (11). My value increases by 1. Player 1's value decreases by 1.\n\nThis is my best bet because:\n1. It is the minimal \"loss\" I impose on Player 1 while still achieving my objective of increasing total value.\n2. I have plenty of Wheat (21) and Wood is something I could use more of, as it's better than Wheat.\n3. It has not been tried before.\n\nIf this is rejected, I'm at an impasse where Player 1 won't make a deal unless it benefits them, and I can't make a deal that benefits me.\nI have to make *an* offer.\n\nIf I offer 2 Wheat for 1 Wood, and it is rejected, my only options are to offer something where I lose value (against objective) or where I offer something where P1 gains (which means I lose).\n\nThis is the least \"aggressive\" offer to Player 1 that still benefits me directly.\nLet's make this offer.\n\nCurrent resources:\n+ [Wheat] Qty: 21 Value: 5 -> Total 105\n+ [Wood] Qty: 7 Value: 11 -> Total 77\n+ [Sheep] Qty: 18 Value: 18 -> Total 324\n+ [Brick] Qty: 10 Value: 22 -> Total 220\n+ [Ore] Qty: 7 Value: 34 -> Total 238\nCurrent Total Value: 964\n\nProposed trade: Offer 2 Wheat (10) for 1 Wood (11).\nIf accepted:\n- Wheat: 19 (Value 95)\n- Wood: 8 (Value 88)\n- Sheep: 18 (Value 324)\n- Brick: 10 (Value 220)\n- Ore: 7 (Value 238)\nNew Total Value: 95 + 88 + 324 + 220 + 238 = 965.\nGain of 1 value. Player 1 loses 1 value. This is the absolute minimum negative impact on P1 while still achieving my goal.\n\nFinal check: Is there any other trade that gives me a +1 value gain?\nYes, for example:\n- Offer 1 Wheat (5) and 1 Wood (11) for 1 Sheep (18). I give 16, get 18. Gain 2. P1 loses 2. But 1 Wood is more valuable than 2 Wheat.\n- Offer 1 Wheat (5), 1 Sheep (18) for 1 Brick (22). I give 23, get 22. Losing 1. Bad.\n\nWhat about a multi-resource offer to make it more appealing?\nOffer 2 Wheat (10) for 1 Wood (11) is simple and directly beneficial by 1 value.\n\nI will stick with the 2 Wheat for 1 Wood offer.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood]",

This means I should always aim for trades where the value of what I receive is greater than the value of what I give up.\n2.  **Resource Values:**\n    *   Wheat: 5\n    *   Wood: 11\n    *   Sheep: 18\n    *   Brick: 22\n    *   Ore: 34\n3.  **Current Resources and Quantities:**\n    *   Wheat: 21 (Abundant, low value)\n    *   Wood: 7 (Moderate value, moderate quantity)\n    *   Sheep: 18 (Moderate value, abundant due to quantity)\n    *   Brick: 10 (High value, moderate quantity)\n    *   Ore: 7 (Highest value, scarce)\n4.  **Past Offers Analysis (My Side):**\n    *   `[Offer: 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore]` (30 value -> 34 value): Rejected. My offer was already favorable to me. Player 1 likely believes 1 Ore is worth more than 6 Wheat, or they need Wheat less than I need Ore.\n    *   `[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore]` (40 value -> 34 value): Rejected. Even less favorable for me. Still rejected. Player 1 is not interested in trading Ore for Wheat.\n    *   `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]` (20 value -> 22 value): Rejected. Slightly favorable to me. Player 1 might value Brick higher or not need Wheat.\n    *   `[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood]` (10 value -> 11 value): Rejected. Slightly favorable to me.\n    *   **Conclusion on My Offers:** Player 1 consistently rejects offers where I give low-value abundant resources (Wheat) for their higher-value scarce resources (Ore, Brick, Wood). This suggests Player 1 either has similar resource needs, values their higher-tier resources very highly, or has an abundance of Wheat. They are also not accepting slightly unfavorable deals for themselves. My current strategy of offloading Wheat is not working.\n5.  **Incoming Offer Analysis (Player 1's Side):**\n    *   `[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep]`\n    *   **Value of Offered Resources (Player 1 gives to me):**\n        *   3 Sheep * 18 = 54\n        *   2 Ore * 34 = 68\n        *   Total Offered: 54 + 68 = 122\n    *   **Value of Requested Resources (I give to Player 1):**\n        *   5 Brick * 22 = 110\n        *   2 Sheep * 18 = 36\n        *   Total Requested: 110 + 36 = 146\n    *   **Net Value Change for Me:** 122 (receive) - 146 (give) = -24. This trade decreases my total value.\n    *   **Resource Type Analysis:** I give up Brick (high value, moderate quantity) and Sheep (moderate value, abundant). I receive Sheep (moderate value, abundant) and Ore (highest value, scarce).\n    *   **Strategic Implication:** This is a clear \"No-Go\" based on value alone. Player 1 is trying to offload Sheep and Ore for Brick and Sheep. Perhaps Player 1 has a surplus of Sheep and Ore and needs Brick. The trade is highly unfavorable to me in terms of value. I should never accept a trade that decreases my overall value.\n\n6.  **Next Steps/Strategy:**\n    *   Immediately reject the current offer.\n    *   Re-evaluate my own trading strategy. My current strategy of offloading cheap resources is not working. I need to understand what Player 1 values.\n    *   Player 1 is willing to give up Ore, but at a very high cost to me. This suggests they have an abundance of Ore or are desperate for Brick.\n    *   My current resources:\n        *   Wheat: 21 (I have a lot, low value)\n        *   Wood: 7 (Moderate value, moderate quantity)\n        *   Sheep: 18 (I have a lot, moderate value)\n        *   Brick: 10 (I have some, high value)\n        *   Ore: 7 (I have some, highest value)\n    *   I need to consider offering resources I have in surplus (Wheat, Sheep) for resources I want more of (Ore, Wood, Brick, but only if the value increases).\n    *   Since Player 1 offered Ore, it might mean they have too much Ore or are desperate for Brick. I have Brick. I could try to offer Brick but demand a *higher* value in return, or demand specific resources like Ore or Wood.\n    *   Since my objective is *increasing total value*, I should prioritize acquiring Ore or Brick if the trade is favorable.\n    *   Player 1 rejected multiple Wheat offers, so they don't seem to want Wheat.\n    *   Player 1 offered away Sheep and Ore for Brick and Sheep. This means they value Brick highly. I have Brick.\n\nNo, I will not accept the trade.\n\n[Deny]",

      "response": "Generate Knowledge:\n1.  **Objective:** Increase total resource value. This means I should always seek trades where the value of resources I give up is less than the value of resources I receive.\n2.  **Resource Valuation:**\n    *   Wheat: 5\n    *   Wood: 11\n    *   Sheep: 18\n    *   Brick: 22\n    *   Ore: 34\n3.  **Current Net Worth (Before any trades):** (21 * 5) + (7 * 11) + (18 * 18) + (10 * 22) + (7 * 34) = 105 + 77 + 324 + 220 + 238 = 964\n4.  **Analyze Player 1's Behavior:** Player 1 has consistently rejected my offers for Ore and Brick. They have also made offers involving Sheep, Ore, and Brick. This suggests they might value Ore and Brick highly, or that they have an abundance of Sheep.\n5.  **Evaluate Incoming Offer (Player 1):** Player 1 is offering \"2 Ore\" for \"2 Brick\".\n    *   Value of Offered (2 Ore): 2 * 34 = 68\n    *   Value of Requested (2 Brick): 2 * 22 = 44\n    *   This is a deeply unfavorable trade for me (I'd lose 68 - 44 = 24 value). I should definitely reject this.\n6.  **Identify Good Trades for Me:**\n    *   **High-Value Acquisitions:** I primarily want to acquire Ore (34) or Brick (22) by giving up lower-value resources (Wheat 5, Wood 11, Sheep 18).\n    *   **Efficient Trades:** Look for ratios that are favorable. For example, trading 1 Wood (11) for 1 Wheat (5) is bad, but trading 1 Ore (34) for 2 Brick (44) is good IF I had excess Ore and needed Brick badly. Here, I have more Brick (10) than Ore (7), but Ore is my highest value resource.\n7.  **Consider Player 1's rejections:** My previous offers (e.g., 6 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick) were all rejected. This indicates Player 1 either highly values Ore/Brick or values Wheat very low, or both. Their last offer (2 Ore -> 2 Brick) reinforces that they may value Brick highly.\n8.  **Strategic Adjustments:**\n    *   My previous offers for Ore and Brick were too low for Player 1. I need to increase the \"cost\" of my request.\n    *   Player 1 seems reluctant to give up Ore/Brick cheaply.\n    *   Player 1 offered \"3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\" before. This simplifies to \"1 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick\". Value of their offer: (1*18) + (2*34) = 18 + 68 = 86. Value of requested: (5*22) = 110. This was a good trade for me, I would have gained 110 - 86 = 24 value. **Mistake: I rejected this earlier. I need to be more careful in evaluating offers.**\n    *   Given the current offer from Player 1 (2 Ore -> 2 Brick), which is terrible for me, I need to make a new offer that is tempting for Player 1 *and* beneficial for me.\n    *   I have a surplus of Wheat (21). It's my lowest value resource. I should try to use it to acquire higher-value resources.\n    *   I have a decent amount of Sheep (18). It's a mid-value resource.\n    *   I have the least amount of Wood, Brick, and Ore, and these are my highest value.\n9.  **Formulating a New Offer:**\n    *   I want Ore or Brick.\n    *   Player 1 rejected 8 Wheat for 1 Ore. That's 40 value for 34 value. Still good for me, but maybe they don't need Wheat.\n    *   Player 1's offer of Sheep/Ore for Brick shows they might be interested in Brick.\n    *   My objective is to increase value.\n    *   Let's try to get Ore again, as it's the highest value. But I need to offer more.\n    *   Perhaps offer a slightly higher-value resource, like Sheep or Wood, along with Wheat, to balance the trade in Player 1's eyes, while still making it profitable for me.\n\nMy current resource values:\nWheat: 5\nWood: 11\nSheep: 18\nBrick: 22\nOre: 34\n\nPlayer 1's current offer: 2 Ore -> 2 Brick.\nMy value: 2 * 34 = 68. Player 1's value: 2 * 22 = 44. I *lose* 24 value. **Reject.**\n\nWhat can I offer for 1 Ore (value 34)?\n*   8 Wheat = 40 (Rejected multiple times, P1 doesn't like this ratio for Ore)\n*   1 Wood + X Wheat? (11 + X * 5). For 1 Ore (34), I need 23 more value. That's about 4-5 Wheat. (1 Wood + 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore) = 11 + 25 = 36. This is a good trade for me (gain 2 value). It might be more appealing to Player 1 if they want Wood.\n*   1 Sheep + X Wheat? (18 + X * 5). For 1 Ore (34), I need 16 more value. That's about 3-4 Wheat. (1 Sheep + 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore) = 18 + 15 = 33. This is an excellent trade for me (gain 1 value), nearly neutral for P1.\n    Given I have 18 Sheep, this is very viable. I'd be trading 33 value for 34 value. Player 1 might accept this because it's close to balanced.\n\nWhat can I offer for 1 Brick (value 22)?\n*   4 Wheat = 20 (Rejected).\n*   1 Wood (11) + 2 Wheat (10) = 21. This is close to 1 Brick (22). (1 Wood + 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick). Values: 21 vs 22. Good for me, relatively balanced for P1.\n\nLet's try the Sheep + Wheat for Ore. It's high value and I have enough Sheep.\nOffer: 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore.\nMy value given up: 18 + 15 = 33.\nValue received: 34.\nNet gain: +1. This is a small gain, but given Player 1's reluctance, a small gain is better than no gain. It also signals I'm willing to offer more than just Wheat.\n\nIf not that, perhaps try for Brick, as Player 1 showed interest in it by trying to acquire it.\nOffer: 1 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick.\nMy value given up: 11 + 10 = 21.\nValue received: 22.\nNet gain: +1. Also small, but positive.\n\nGiven Player 1's latest offer involved Ore and Brick, perhaps they are trying to shift between them. Let's stick to trying to get Ore as it's the highest value resource for me.\n\nFinal decision on next move: Reject Player 1's offer (2 Ore -> 2 Brick) and then make a new offer that is more balanced for Player 1, aiming for Ore or Brick. The 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat for 1 Ore seems like a reasonable next step.\n\nAlso, I rejected \"3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep\" earlier which simplified to \"1 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick\".\nValue offered: 1 Sheep (18) + 2 Ore (68) = 86.\nValue requested: 5 Brick (110).\nNet gain for me: 110 - 86 = 24.\nI should have accepted that. This highlights I need to quickly evaluate the value of *all* resources in an offer and the request.\n\nNow, Player 1 is offering 2 Ore for 2 Brick.\nValue of offer (2 Ore): 2 * 34 = 68.\nValue of request (2 Brick): 2 * 22 = 44.\nThis is me *giving* 68 value and *getting* 44 value. **Unacceptable.**\n\nGame state: Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 2 Ore -> Requested items: 2 Brick.\nMy action now is to respond to this offer.\n\nNext action: Reject Player 1's currently active offer. Then, propose a new trade. My new trade should consider the current resource quantities and the value gained.\n\nI have 21 Wheat, 7 Wood, 18 Sheep, 10 Brick, 7 Ore.\nTo gain value, I want to acquire high-value resources (Ore 34, Brick 22) for lower-value ones (Wheat 5, Wood 11, Sheep 18).\n\nMy previous offers for Ore/Brick failed. Player 1 clearly wants more value than I'm offering with just Wheat.\nLet's try a different approach, one that might appeal to Player 1 by offering a higher value resource.\nI have a lot of Sheep. Perhaps 1 Sheep for 1 Brick?\nMy value offered: 1 Sheep = 18.\nMy value received: 1 Brick = 22.\nNet gain for me: +4. This is a good trade.\nThis might be more palatable for Player 1 than a large quantity of Wheat.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\nValue of 1 Sheep = 18. Value of 1 Brick = 22. I gain 4 value.\nThis is a simple, clear offer, and offers Player 1 a high-value resource (Sheep) for a slightly higher-value resource (Brick), which might make it appealing if they need Sheep or have excess Brick.",
