      "response": "Preflop Analysis  \n- Position: I\u2019m the Big Blind, so I act last pre-flop (even heads-up OOP in every later street, but pre-flop I see P1\u2019s action first).  \n- Pot size: 30 chips (20 from P1 small blind, 10 from me Big Blind).  \n- Villain\u2019s actions so far: he only posted the 20; no raise. He hasn\u2019t bet anything extra yet.  \n- Hand strength: K\u2665 9\u2663 offsuit is not premium, but ahead of a lot of limping / stealing ranges heads-up and has good board coverage with a King blocker.  \n- SPR if flatting is pot of 40 with effective stacks of 980. Easy playability post-flop.\n\nDecision: I want to raise for value now to build a pot, deny some equity from random hands, and deny free equity from low cards. A sensible size is around 60\u201370 chips (3\u20133.5\u00d7 the SB\u2019s 20). I\u2019ll pick 70; it\u2019s large enough to pressure more holdings without risking an outsized chunk of stack early in the session.\n\n[Action to send]\n[Raise 70]",
