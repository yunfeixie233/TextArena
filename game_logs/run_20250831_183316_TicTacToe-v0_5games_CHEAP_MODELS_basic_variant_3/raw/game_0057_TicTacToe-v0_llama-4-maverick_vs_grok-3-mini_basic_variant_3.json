I'll wait for the updated board. \n\nAssuming the response will be an 'X' in one of the available positions, I'll make my next move accordingly. \n\nLet's proceed: I'll wait for the 'X' move. \n\nIf you are making the 'X' move, the format should be '[X]', where X is the cell number.\n\nMy current move is: [4] \n\nLet's wait for the game to progress.

The current state is:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[7]', '[8]'\n\nGiven that 'X' has been placed in positions [0] and [6], and 'O' is in positions [2] and [4], I need to strategically place my next 'O'. \n\nSince 'X' has two 'X's and 'O' has two 'O's so far, and 'X' has a potential to win if they get a chance to place their next 'X' in a strategic position, I need to prioritize blocking 'X' from winning or creating a potential win for 'O'.\n\nThe best move now is to place 'O' in a position that will either block 'X' from winning or set up a potential win for 'O'. \n\nGiven the current state, I'll place my 'O' in position [8] to potentially create a situation that could benefit 'O'. \n\nMy move is: [8]\n\nThe updated board should be:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | O \n\nLet's wait for the response.\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1]  [7]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | X | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] To make my next move, I need to analyze the current state of the board.\n\nThe current state is:\n\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | X | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[8]'\n\nSince 'X' is at positions [0] and [6] and [7], and 'O' is at positions [1], [2], and [4], I need to strategically place my next 'O'. The goal is either to block 'X' from winning or to create a potential win for 'O'.\n\n'X' has three 'X's, so they are in a strong position. To win, 'X' needs one more 'X'. The potential winning positions for 'X' are not immediately apparent since they don't have three 'X's in a row yet, but they could achieve this by placing their next 'X' in either [3] or [8]. \n\nFor 'O', the potential winning positions involve using the existing 'O's at [1], [2], and [4]. One potential win could be achieved if 'O' can get a row or column with three 'O's.\n\nTo block 'X' or create a potential win, 'O' should aim to occupy a strategic position.\n\nLet's analyze:\n1. If 'X' places their next 'X' at [3], 'X' won't win immediately, but it will be a strong move.\n2. If 'X' places their next 'X' at [8], 'X' won't win immediately because they don't have three 'X's in a row.\n\n'O' can win if they place their next 'O' at [8] and then potentially get a chance to place their next 'O' in a strategic position, but we need to think ahead.\n\nHowever, the immediate move to make is to place 'O' in position [8] or [5] or [3]. \n\nConsidering 'X' can win if they get a chance, the best move is to place 'O' in position [8] to potentially limit 'X's options or set up for 'O'.\n\nMy move is: [8]\n\nThe updated board should be:\n\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | X | O \n\nLet's see the outcome.\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 3.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n O | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | X | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[5]', '[8]'",
