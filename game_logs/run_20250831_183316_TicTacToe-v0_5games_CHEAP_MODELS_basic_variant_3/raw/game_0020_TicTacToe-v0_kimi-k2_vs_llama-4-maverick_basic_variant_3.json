The current board looks like this:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nThe opponent has placed their 'O' in cell 4. A good strategy is to control the center or respond to the opponent's center control by placing my 'X' in a strategic position. Since they have taken the center, I will place my 'X' in a corner to potentially create a strong foundation for a future win or to challenge their control indirectly.\n\nI will choose cell 8 because it's a corner and starting to build from a corner can be advantageous. \n\nMy move is: [8]\n\n Current Board after my move should be:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nLet's wait for the game update.\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n 0 | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] [0]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 0.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1] To make my next move, I'll analyze the current state of the board.\n\nThe current board looks like this:\n\n O | 1 | 2 \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nThe opponent has placed their 'O' in cell 0, and I had placed my 'X' in cell 8. They now have two 'O's on the board, in cells 0 and 4, and I need to respond strategically.\n\nSince my 'X' is in cell 8, a corner, and their 'O' is in cell 0, another corner, I should try to challenge their control and potentially create a fork or block their potential three-in-a-row.\n\nGiven the available moves, I will place my 'X' in cell 2, which is another corner. This could help in creating a strong foundation for a potential win.\n\nMy move is: [2]\n\nThe current board after my move should be:\n\n O | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nLet's wait for the game update.\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 0] \n[GAME] Player 0 attempted an invalid move.

They now have three 'O's on the board, in cells 0, 4, and 6, and I need to respond strategically to block their potential win.\n\nSince they have 'O's in cells 0 and 6, they have the potential to win if they get a third 'O' in a row. However, their 'O's are in cells 0, and 6, and 6, which doesn't form a straightforward winning line. I should focus on blocking potential winning lines and creating opportunities for myself.\n\nGiven the available moves, I will place my 'X' in cell 3, which is adjacent to their 'O' in cell 0 and their 'O' in cell 4 (diagonally is not the case here but it is in the same row as cell 4 and column as cell 0 and 6 indirectly). However, a more strategic move is to look for a potential fork.\n\nA more optimal move is to place my 'X' in cell 7 because it is between their 'O' in cell 6 and my 'X' in cell 8, and it also opens up a potential for a fork or blocks a potential 'O' win if they were to try to get three 'O's in a row.\n\nHowever, a more straightforward analysis suggests that I should focus on the available cells and try to create a potential winning line or block their line.\n\nMy move is: [7]\n\nThe current board after my move should be:\n\n O | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | X | X \n\nLet's wait for the game update.\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 7.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n O | 1 | X \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n O | X | X \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]'",
