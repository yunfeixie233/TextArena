This prevents you from securing a win on your next turn. Additionally, this move strengthens my position by connecting my X at cell 0 and cell 7, potentially setting up threats in column 0 (cells 0, 3, and 6) or other lines, while forcing you to respond defensively and limiting your options. Always essential to neutralize opponent threats first in a tight game like this.\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 6.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | X | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] [8]  \n**Rationale:**  \n- **Immediate Threat Block:** Player 1 threatens to win by claiming cell 8 (bottom row: X-X-8). By playing [8], I block their victory condition.  \n- **Optimal Defense:** Since no immediate winning move exists for me, preventing opponent victory takes priority.  \n- **Forced Outcome:** Post-move, Player 1 can win via cell 3 (column 0: X-3-X), but delaying their win is strategically necessary. All other moves ([3] or [5]) allow instant defeat next turn.  \n\nFinal Board:  \nX|O|O  \n-+-+--  \n |O|  \n-+-+--  \nX|X|O\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | O | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n X | X | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]'",
