Check if I can win in one move.\n2. Check if my opponent can win in one move and block them.\n3. If neither of the above, choose a move that sets up a win or takes a strategic position.\n\nApplying this strategy:\n1. Check for my win:\n    - Row 0-1-2: I have X at 0 and X at 1. Cell 2 is O. No win.\n    - Row 3-4-5: O at 4. No win.\n    - Row 6-7-8: O at 8. No win.\n    - Column 0-3-6: X at 0, no X at 3 or 6. No win.\n    - Column 1-4-7: X at 1, O at 4. No win.\n    - Column 2-5-8: O at 2, O at 8. No win.\n    - Diagonal 0-4-8: X at 0, O at 4, O at 8. No win.\n    - Diagonal 2-4-6: O at 2, O at 4. Cell 6 is available. NO! I just realized I put X at 1, not 6, in the previous round. This means my previous move was incorrect. I need to re-evaluate based on the *actual* board.\n\nLet's re-evaluate based on the *actual* board state:\n\nCurrent Board:\n\n X | X | O\n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5\n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O\n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n\nMy previous move was intended to be `[6]`, but the game recorded it as `[1]`. This is a critical error. I need to adjust my strategy based on the current reality of the board.\n\nRe-applying strategy with the *actual* board:\n1. Check if I can win in one move:\n    - I now have X at 0 and X at 1. If I place X at 3 (creating a vertical line 0-3-6) or 5 (not possible as 5 is not in a line with 0,1) or 6 (0-X-6 is not a straight line) or 7 (1-X-7 is not a straight line).\n    - Look for two 'X's in a line with an open third spot:\n        - Row 0 (X), 1 (X). Cell 2 is 'O'. No win here.\n        - Other rows/columns/diagonals don't have two 'X's for me yet. No immediate win for me.\n\n2. Check if my opponent can win in one move and block them:\n    - Opponent has 'O' at 2, 4, and 8.\n    - Danger lines for 'O':\n        - Row 2-5-8: O at 2, O at 8. If O places at cell 5, they win. (2, 5, 8).\n        - Column 2-5-8: Same as above.\n        - Column 1-4-7: O at 4. No other O in this column.\n        - Column 0-3-6: No O.\n        - Diagonal 0-4-8: O at 4, O at 8. If O places at cell 0, they win. But cell 0 is X. So no win here for 'O'.\n        - Diagonal 2-4-6: O at 2, O at 4. If O places at cell 6, they win. (2, 4, 6).\n    - My opponent has *two* immediate winning threats:\n        - Winning at cell [5] creates line (2,5,8).\n        - Winning at cell [6] creates line (2,4,6).\n\n    I must block one of these. If I block [5], my opponent can still win at [6]. If I block [6], my opponent can still win at [5]. This is a critical situation! This means my opponent has created a \"fork\".\n\n    I have to choose which one to block.\n    Blocking cell [6] (diagonal 2-4-6) would make my board:\n    X | X | O\n    ---+---+---\n    3 | O | 5\n    ---+---+---\n    X | 7 | O\n\n    Blocking cell [5] (row/col 2-5-8) would make my board:\n    X | X | O\n    ---+---+---\n    3 | O | X\n    ---+---+---\n    6 | 7 | O\n\n    Since player 0 made a move to cell 8 (which completed the (2,4,8) diagonal threat if 0 was empty), they are trying to gain control of corners. My priority is to prevent their win.\n\n    I can only block one. I will block the one that seems most directly relevant to my overall control, which is hard here.\n    Given I cannot block both, I have to pick one and hope the game flow allows me to recover or create my own threat.\n\n    Let's block cell [6]. This also completes the 0-O-6 column which contains my X at 0.\n    I can also try to choose a move that creates my own threat.\n    If I choose [6], I create a diagonal with X at 0, potentially useful later. No, it's not a diagonal with X at 0. It's X at 0, O at 4, X at 6. Still not a threat for me.\n\n    This is a losing position. My opponent has set up a fork. I can only block one. I will have to lose in the next turn if my opponent plays optimally.\n\n    I will block cell [6].\n\nMy move is: [6]",

That doesn\u2019t create any immediate \u201ctwo-in-a-row\u201d threats, but it does give them potential on the top row (0-1-2) and the main diagonal (0-4-8).  \n- My best counter is to take one of the other corners, because corners give two intersecting lines and limit my opponent\u2019s options.  Of the two open corners (2 and 8), I\u2019ll pick the top-right corner [2] to threaten the top row (O in 4, O in 2) and the anti-diagonal (2-4-6).  \n\nTherefore my move is: [2]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 2.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | 1 | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 1]  I will follow the instructions to place my Mark 'X'.\nI will make an unbroken sequence of three identical marks in a straight line.\nThe current board is:\n\n X | 1 | O\n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5\n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8\n\nAvailable Moves: '[1]', '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n\nMy strategy:\n1.

If neither of the above, choose a move that sets up a win or takes a strategic position.\n\nApplying this strategy:\n1. No immediate win for me.\n2. My opponent just placed an 'O' in cell 2. My opponent currently has 'O' in cells 2 and 4. This creates two potential win threats for my opponent:\n    - Row 0-1-2: If my opponent places 'O' in cell 1, they would win.\n    - Diagonal 2-4-6: If my opponent places 'O' in cell 6, they would win.\n    I must block one of these. Blocking cell 6 seems more directly useful for me as it is a corner, and corners are good.\n3. Blocking my opponent's win condition is the highest priority. I need to block either cell 1 or cell 6. Cell 6 is a corner, which is strategically a strong position.\n\nI will block my opponent's potential win by choosing cell 6.\n\nMy move is: [6]\n[GAME] Player 1 placed their symbol (X) in cell 1.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | 8 \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'\n[Player 0] I examine the board:\n\n- Player 1 has just put an X in cell 1, creating the top row X-X-O.  \n- For winning threats:\n  \u2022 My O\u2019s are at 4 and 2 \u2013 together with either 6 or 0 they could form a diagonal, but 0 is already X and 6 is open. Potentially {2,4,6} is open, but 6 is open.  \n  \u2022 I don\u2019t have any two-in-a-row that would yield an immediate win on my next move.\n\nHowever, Player 1 now has two X\u2019s in the top row (0 and 1), and only one spot left in that row: cell 2 is already taken by my O, so no vertical/row threat to block for them with that move.\n\nMy best play now is to tighten control of the other diagonal (2-4-6). By taking the final corner [8] I set up pressure along the bottom row and the other diagonal (6-4-2 is incomplete {_,O,O}, not a threat right away, but 8 still gives me future double threats).\n\nThus my move is: [8]\n[GAME] Player 0 placed their symbol (O) in cell 8.\n[GAME] Current Board:\n\n X | X | O \n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5 \n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O \n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n[Player 1]  I will follow the instructions to place my Mark 'X'.\nI will make an unbroken sequence of three identical marks in a straight line.\nThe current board is:\n\n X | X | O\n---+---+---\n 3 | O | 5\n---+---+---\n 6 | 7 | O\n\nAvailable Moves: '[3]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]'\n\nMy strategy:\n1.
