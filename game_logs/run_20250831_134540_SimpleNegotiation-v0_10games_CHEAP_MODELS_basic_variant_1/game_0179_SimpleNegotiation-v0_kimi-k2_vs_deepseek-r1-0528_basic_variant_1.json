      "response": "Let me think through this latest offer:\n\n**Their offer:** 1 Ore, 3 Sheep \u2192 4 Brick  \n**The values:**  \n- I give: 4 Brick (value = 4 \u00d7 21 = 84)  \n- I get: 1 Ore (value = 37) + 3 Sheep (value = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54) \u2192 total = 91  \n\n**Net value change for me:** +7 (91 - 84).  \nBut I would lose 25% of my Brick supply, and I only have 11 left. Brick is one of my most useful resources, and my flexibility drops if I go too low. Also, in prior turns P1 has only been willing to trade if I overpay (like 5 Sheep for 4 Brick or 4 Sheep for 3 Brick). That pattern suggests they highly value Brick, and this same ratio again undervalues Brick from my point of view.\n\nTherefore:\n\n[Deny]",
