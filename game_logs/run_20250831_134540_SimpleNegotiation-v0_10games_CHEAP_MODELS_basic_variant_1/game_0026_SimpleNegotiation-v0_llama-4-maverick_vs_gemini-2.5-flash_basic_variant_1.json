      "response": "### Negotiation Game: Turn 1\n\n#### Current Resources and Values:\n- **[Wheat]**: Qty: 9, Value: 5\n- **[Wood]**: Qty: 23, Value: 11\n- **[Sheep]**: Qty: 15, Value: 15\n- **[Brick]**: Qty: 17, Value: 27\n- **[Ore]**: Qty: 20, Value: 37\n\n#### Game State:\n- Turn: 1/10\n\n#### Action:\nTo start, I will analyze my current resources and their values. My most valuable resources are Ore (Value: 37) and Brick (Value: 27). I have a considerable quantity of Wood, Sheep, and Ore.\n\nGiven the initial setup, a reasonable strategy is to try to trade less valuable resources for more valuable ones. One potential trade could involve offering some of my abundant resources for something more valuable.\n\nLet's consider a trade offer. I have a lot of Wood (Value: 11), which is relatively less valuable compared to Ore and Brick. I can offer some Wood for a more valuable resource.\n\n### Trade Offer:\n`[Offer: 5 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis offer aims to exchange 5 units of Wood (total value = 5 * 11 = 55) for 1 unit of Ore (value = 37). However, upon reevaluation, this doesn't seem like a good trade for me as I'm offering more value than I'm getting. Let's adjust the strategy.\n\n### Alternative Trade Offer:\nConsidering the values, a more balanced trade would be:\n`[Offer: 2 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 1 Brick]`\n\nHere, I'm offering 2 Wheat (2*5 = 10) and 3 Wood (3*11 = 33), totaling a value of 43, for 1 Brick (value = 27). This is still not a great trade for me as I'm offering more value.\n\n### Revised Trade Offer:\nLet's think about a trade that could be more beneficial. If I offer some of my less valuable resources for a resource that's relatively more valuable but not as abundant in my inventory:\n`[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 2 Brick]`\n\nThis involves offering 4 Sheep (4*15 = 60) for 2 Brick (2*27 = 54). Again, this isn't favorable.\n\n### Final Thought for Turn 1:\nUpon further consideration, a more reasonable initial offer could be:\n`[Offer: 3 Brick -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThis means offering 3 Brick (3*27 = 81) for 1 Ore (1*37 = 37), which still isn't a good trade for me.\n\nLet's simplify and adjust:\n`[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Wood]`\n\nThis offer is not likely to be accepted as it doesn't seem beneficial for the other party.\n\nRevisiting my resources and thinking about a more viable trade:\n`[Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick]`\n\nThis trade involves giving up 1 Ore (37) and 1 Sheep (15), totaling 52, for 3 Brick (3*27 = 81), which could be seen as a potential gain.\n\n#### Actual Action for Turn 1:\n`[Offer: 1 Ore, 1 Sheep -> 3 Brick]`\n\nLet's see the response from the opponent.",

The previous offer aimed to gain Ore.\n- Wood has a relatively lower value (11), and offering some of it for a higher-value resource like Ore could be beneficial if the terms are favorable.\n\n**New Offer Consideration:**\nSince the previous offer was rejected, we might need to adjust the terms or consider other resources. Let's directly analyze the potential for a new trade offer.\n\nTo gain Ore (high value), we could consider what we have that might be more appealing to trade for Ore. We could think about trading some of our less valuable resources or excess resources for Ore.\n\nLet's directly formulate a potential trade:\n\n**Potential Trade:**\nWe have a significant amount of Wood (23 units), and while it's not the most valuable, offering a bit more of it might be acceptable if it secures a valuable resource like Ore. \n\nLet's propose: \n'[Offer: 7 Wood -> 1 Ore]'\n\nThis action is represented as: `[Offer: 7 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nThus, my action for this turn is: `[Offer: 7 Wood -> 1 Ore]`",

Let's correct that:\n     - Before the trade: 45 + 253 + 225 + 459 + 740 = 1722\n     - After giving 7 Wood and getting 1 Ore: The change is -7*11 (Wood) + 1*37 (Ore) = -77 + 37 = -40. So, the new total should be 1722 - 40 = 1682.\n     - The actual calculation should directly consider the resources: After the trade, we have 16 Wood and 21 Ore.\n\n2. **Analyze the Trade**: Understand the implications of the last trade.\n   - We traded 7 Wood (Value: 11 each) for 1 Ore (Value: 37).\n   - The trade's value impact: Lost 7*11 = 77, Gained 37, Net loss = 40.\n\n3. **Plan the Next Move**: Decide on the next action based on the current state and the goal to increase the total value of resources.\n   - We need to find a trade that benefits us, ideally gaining more valuable resources or getting a better ratio.\n\n4. **Formulate a New Offer**:\n   - Considering our resources and their values, we should look for opportunities to trade less valuable resources for more valuable ones.\n   - One potential trade could involve offering some Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 11) for more valuable resources like Ore (Value: 37), Brick (Value: 27), or Sheep (Value: 15).\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nLet's formulate a new offer. We can offer some of our Wood for a more valuable resource. For instance, offering 5 Wood for 1 Brick could be a reasonable trade since it involves exchanging resources of value 55 for something worth 27, which might not be favorable. However, we need to propose something that could be attractive to the other player while benefiting us.\n\nGiven the current quantities and values, a potential offer could be:\n- **[Offer: 4 Wheat, 3 Wood -> 2 Sheep]**: This involves giving away resources worth (4*5) + (3*11) = 20 + 33 = 53 for 2 Sheep worth 2*15 = 30. This isn't a good trade for us as it results in a net loss.\n\nLet's reassess and propose a potentially beneficial trade:\n- **[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]**: This involves giving away 2*5 = 10 for 1 Brick worth 27, resulting in a net gain of 17.\n\nThus, a reasonable next step could be:\n**[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Brick]**",

Offered 7 Wood for 1 Ore (Accepted by Player 1)\n   - Before: Wood = 23, Ore = 20\n   - After: Wood = 23 - 7 = 16, Ore = 20 + 1 = 21\n\nCurrent Resources:\n- Wheat: 9\n- Wood: 16\n- Sheep: 15\n- Brick: 17\n- Ore: 21\n\nLet's analyze the last offers and think about the next step.\n\n1. **Last Offer from Player 0:** Offered 3 Wheat for 1 Brick (Rejected by Player 1)\n   - This offer was not favorable to Player 1, likely because they valued Wheat less than Brick at that ratio.\n\n2. **Last Offer from Player 1:** Offered 1 Ore for 10 Wood\n   - To evaluate this, let's consider the value:\n     - 10 Wood = 10 * 11 = 110\n     - 1 Ore = 1 * 37 = 37\n     - This is not a good deal for Player 0 since 110 > 37.\n\nGiven the current state and the recent offers, let's think about the next move:\n\n1. **Evaluate the current resources and their values:**\n   - Total Value = (9 * 5) + (16 * 11) + (15 * 15) + (17 * 27) + (21 * 37)\n   - Total Value = 45 + 176 + 225 + 459 + 777 = 1682\n\n2. **Consider making a counteroffer to Player 1's last offer:**\n   - Since their offer of 1 Ore for 10 Wood was not accepted, we could try to negotiate a better ratio.\n   - We could offer something less than 10 Wood but still more than what we think is fair, to negotiate.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer that is more balanced. For instance, we could offer 6 Wood for 1 Ore, which is a compromise between their request (10 Wood) and a more reasonable trade (7 Wood for 1 Ore was previously accepted).\n\nThe offer would be: `[Offer: 6 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's format this according to the required action format:\n`[Offer: 6 Wood -> 1 Ore]`\n\nSo, the action is: `[Offer: 6 Wood -> 1 Ore]`",

      "response": "Since we are currently at Turn 6 and my previous offer was rejected by Player 1, let's assess the current state and decide on the next action.\n\nCurrent Resources:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 9    Value: 5\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 16   Value: 11 (23 - 7 = 16, because 7 Wood were traded for 1 Ore in the previous turn)\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 15   Value: 15\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 17   Value: 27\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 21   Value: 37 (20 + 1 = 21, because 1 Ore was received in exchange for 7 Wood)\n\nThe last offer from Player 1 was: Offered items: 1 Ore -> Requested items: 10 Wood. \nThis offer was rejected by me because it was unfavorable (10 Wood is worth 110, and 1 Ore is worth 37).\n\nTo make a new offer, we need to think about what we can give that is not too costly and what we can gain that is valuable.\n\n## Step 1: Evaluate the last trade and the current state.\nWe traded 7 Wood for 1 Ore, which is a value exchange of 77 (7*11) for 37. Although it was not the best deal, we still need to think about the next step considering our current resources and the value of the items.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the values and quantities of the resources.\nWe have a good amount of Wood (16), Wheat (9), and a significant amount of Ore (21) and Brick (17). The next trade should aim to either get a better deal for our resources or acquire something valuable.\n\n## Step 3: Think about a reasonable trade offer.\nSince our last offer (6 Wood for 1 Ore) was rejected, and considering we still have a decent amount of Wood, let's think about other resources. We could offer Wheat or other resources for something valuable. Noting that Brick and Ore are quite valuable, let's consider not giving away too much of our more valuable resources.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a new trade offer.\nLet's offer some Wheat and Wood for a more valuable resource. For instance, offering 2 Wheat and 4 Wood (total value = 2*5 + 4*11 = 10 + 44 = 54) for 1 Brick (value = 27) or 1 Sheep (value = 15) could be a starting point, but it seems we're giving more than we're getting. Let's adjust our strategy to offer something that could be more appealing.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on the action for this turn.\nLet's make an offer that could be attractive. Offering 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep is a possible trade. The value exchange is 25 (5*5) for 15, which is not favorable. Let's adjust: Offering 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick could be considered, but we need to calculate: (2*5 + 15) = 25 for (2*27) = 54. This is actually a good deal for us.\n\nThe action for this turn is: [Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]\n\nThe response is: [Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 2 Brick]",
