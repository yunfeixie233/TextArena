Player 1 probably rejected it because it was not good enough for them.\n\nLet's make an offer that is slightly more appealing to Player 1, but still beneficial for me.\nI want to get Ore (32) or Brick (24).\nI am rich in Wheat (5) and Sheep (17).\n\nWhat about offering Wood for Brick or Ore?\nI have 7 Wood (value 9).\nIf I offer 3 Wood, I give 27 value.\nI could trade 3 Wood for 1 Brick (24 value). That would be a loss for me.\n\nLet's re-evaluate what Player 1 might need. Since I don't know Player 1's resources, I should assume they also want to increase their value.\n\nLet's try to offer low-value resources for high-value resources again, but make it a bit more balanced.\n\nHow about 4 Wheat and 1 Wood for 1 Brick?\nValue of 4 Wheat = 4 * 5 = 20\nValue of 1 Wood = 1 * 9 = 9\nTotal value offered = 20 + 9 = 29\nValue of 1 Brick = 24\nThis is still a losing trade for me.\n\nLet's try to trade Sheep.\nI have 22 Sheep (value 17).\n\nWhat if I offer 2 Sheep for 1 Brick?\nValue of 2 Sheep = 2 * 17 = 34\nValue of 1 Brick = 24\nThis is a losing trade for me in terms of value.\n\nI should try to gain value, even if it's a small gain.\nLet's try to target Ore again.\n\nWhat if I offer slightly more for 1 Ore than my previous offer?\nMy previous offer was (3 Wheat, 1 Wood) = 24 value for 1 Ore = 32 value.\n\nWhat about (4 Wheat, 1 Wood) for 1 Ore?\nValue offered = 4 * 5 + 1 * 9 = 20 + 9 = 29.\nValue gained = 32.\nGain = 32 - 29 = 3. This is a good trade for me, and potentially more appealing to Player 1.\nIt's still beneficial for me.\n\nLet's try this.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
