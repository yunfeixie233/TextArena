Offered 5 Wood for 1 Sheep (rejected by Player 1).\n2. Offered 4 Wheat and 4 Wood for 1 Brick (rejected by Player 1).\nPlayer 1 made no new trade offers.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the rejected offers to refine the next offer\nThe first offer was for 5 Wood (Value: 8 each, total = 40) for 1 Sheep (Value: 13), which is not favorable since 40 > 13.\nThe second offer was for 4 Wheat (Value: 5 each, total = 20) and 4 Wood (Value: 8 each, total = 32), totaling 52, for 1 Brick (Value: 30), which is also not favorable since 52 > 30.\n\n## Step 5: Consider alternative trade offers that could be more favorable\nTo increase the total value, we should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given the current resources and values, trading Wood (Value: 8) or Wheat (Value: 5) for Brick (Value: 30), Ore (Value: 36), or Sheep (Value: 13) could be beneficial if the exchange rate is favorable.\n\n## Step 6: Formulate a new trade offer based on the analysis\nSince Player 1 rejected offers involving Wood and Wheat for higher-value resources, we need to consider what we have and what we can offer that's more appealing. We have a significant amount of Wood and some Wheat. Let's consider offering some Sheep or Ore, which are relatively valuable, for Brick, which is also valuable but slightly less than Ore.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the possibility of trading Sheep or Ore for Brick\nTrading 1 Ore (Value: 36) for 1 Brick (Value: 30) is not favorable.\nTrading Sheep for Brick could be considered: 1 Brick (Value: 30) is worth more than 2 Sheep (Value: 13 * 2 = 26), so offering 2 Sheep for 1 Brick could be a good offer.\n\n## Step 8: Decide on a new trade offer\nLet's offer 2 Sheep for 1 Brick: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick].\n\n## Step 9: Format the trade offer according to the game's special tokens\n[Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]\n\nThe final answer is: [Offer: 2 Sheep -> 1 Brick]",

However, since the game is at a relatively early stage (we are at turn 8, given that 2 turns have passed with offers and counteroffers), we should think about what we can offer that might be more appealing.\n\n## Step 8: Formulate a new trade offer\nConsider what resources we can spare and what we need. We have a lot of Wood and Sheep. We need Ore and Brick for higher value. A potential offer could involve trading some of our abundant resources for these.\n\n## Step 9: Propose a trade\nLet's consider offering some Sheep and/or Wood for Ore or Brick. We previously offered 4 Wood for 1 Ore and got rejected. Let's try a different combination.\n\n## Step 10: Make a new offer\nOffer: 3 Sheep -> 1 Ore. This involves giving up 3*13 = 39 value for 1*36 = 36 value. Not beneficial.\nLet's think about another combination: Offering some Wheat and Wood for Brick or Ore.\n\n## Step 11: Alternative offer\nConsider: [Offer: 2 Wheat, 6 Wood -> 1 Brick]\n- Giving up: 2 Wheat (2*5 = 10), 6 Wood (6*8 = 48) = 58\n- Receiving: 1 Brick (1*30 = 30)\nThis is not a good trade.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate another potential trade\nLet's directly respond to the current situation and consider our last actions and the offers made.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Offer: 6 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]}$",

The change in Wheat value is -2 * 5 = -10.\n- I have 6 Brick, and I would give away 5, so I would be left with 1 Brick. The change in Brick value is -5 * 30 = -150.\n- I would receive 3 Sheep, so the change in Sheep quantity is +3, and the value is +3 * 13 = 39.\n- I would receive 2 Ore, so the change in Ore quantity is +2, and the value is +2 * 36 = 72.\n\nLet's calculate the total change in value: \n- I give away 2 Wheat: -10\n- I give away 5 Brick: -150\n- I receive 3 Sheep: +39\n- I receive 2 Ore: +72\nThe total change is: -10 -150 +39 +72 = -49.\n\nSince the total change in value is negative (-49), accepting this offer would decrease the total value of my resources, so I should reject it.\n\nThe current turn is 8th, and there are 2 turns remaining after this. I will make a new offer.\n\nLet's consider making a trade that could be more beneficial. I have a lot of Wood and Sheep, and I need to get more valuable resources like Brick or Ore.\n\nI can make the following offer: \n[Offer:4 Sheep,5 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis is represented as: [Offer:4 Sheep,5 Wood ->1 Ore]\n\nLet's check the response of Player1. \n\nThe action is: [Offer:4 Sheep,5 Wood ->1 Ore]",
