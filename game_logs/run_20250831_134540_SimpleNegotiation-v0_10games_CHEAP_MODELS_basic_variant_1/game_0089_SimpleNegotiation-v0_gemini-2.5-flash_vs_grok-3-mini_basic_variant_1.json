This means I want to trade away low-value resources for high-value resources.\n\nPlayer 1's offer is: Offered items: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> Requested items: 1 Ore\n\nLet's calculate the value of the offered items:\n4 Wheat * 5 = 20\n1 Wood * 9 = 9\nTotal offered value = 20 + 9 = 29\n\nLet's calculate the value of the requested items:\n1 Ore * 34 = 34\n\nIn this trade, I would lose 1 Ore (value 34) and gain 4 Wheat (value 20) and 1 Wood (value 9).\nMy net change in value would be 29 - 34 = -5.\n\nAccepting this trade would decrease my total value. Therefore, I should reject it.\n\nMy strategy will continue to be to offer lower value resources for higher value resources. Ore and Brick are my highest value resources. Wheat and Wood are my lowest. Sheep is in the middle.\n\nPrevious offers:\nP0: 2 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore (Offered value: 2*5 + 2*9 = 10 + 18 = 28. Requested value: 34. Margin: +6 for P0. Rejected)\nP1: 2 Wheat -> 1 Sheep (Offered value: 2*5 = 10. Requested value: 15. Margin: +5 for P1. Rejected)\nP0: 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore (Offered value: 2*15 = 30. Requested value: 34. Margin: +4 for P0. Rejected)\nP1: 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep (Offered value: 1*9 = 9. Requested value: 15. Margin: +6 for P1. Rejected)\nP0 made no offer, P1 rejected. This implies Player 0 needs to be more active.\n\nGiven the rejection of 2 Sheep for 1 Ore (a good deal for me), and the current offer of 4 Wheat, 1 Wood for 1 Ore (a bad deal for me), Player 1 seems reluctant to give up Ore easily.\n\nI have an abundance of Brick (24) which has a decent value (22). I might try to leverage that.\nI still want to get more Ore.\n\nHow about trading one of my abundant, good-value resources (Brick) for Ore?\nIf I offer 1 Brick (value 22) for 1 Ore (value 34), that's a good deal for me (+12). Player 1 might accept it if they need Brick.\n\nOr I can try to give up more lower valued resources for Brick/Ore.\n\nMy current resource quantities:\nWheat: 21\nWood: 18\nSheep: 19\nBrick: 24\nOre: 10\n\nI have a lot of Brick.\nLet's try to offer multiple lower-value resources for one\nOre, or one Brick.\n\nLet's try to get Ore. Ore is the highest value.\nHow about 5 Wheat (value 25) for 1 Ore (value 34)? That would be +9 for me.\nOr 3 Wood (value 27) for 1 Ore (value 34)? That would be +7 for me.\n\nThe last offer I made of \"2 Sheep -> 1 Ore\" was a reasonable offer from my perspective (30 for 34). Player 1 rejected it. This suggests they want more value for their Ore.\n\nI have 24 Brick. Maybe I can offer some Brick + some Wheat to get Ore?\nBut that would be trading good value for best value and lower value for best.\nI should stick to trading low value for high value resources.\n\nI'll reject this offer since it decreases my value.\nThen I will make a new offer.\nMy rejection reason: the current offer decreases my total value.\n\nMy new offer will be:\n\"[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]\" (Value given: 27, Value gained: 34; +7 net value)\nThis is a better deal for Player 1 than 2 Sheep for 1 Ore (they'd give up 30 for 34 vs 27 for 34), but still a gain for me.\n\nIf the goal is to increase total value, and Player 1 keeps making offers that decrease my value, I must deny them and propose my own.\n\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 3 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
