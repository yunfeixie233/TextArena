      "response": "As Player 0, you need to decide on your next move. Currently, you've rejected several offers from Player 1 for Wheat in exchange for Wood and Ore. \n\nLet's evaluate the situation:\n\n**Your Current Resources:**\n- Wheat: 23 (Value: 6)\n- Wood: 19 (Value: 9)\n- Sheep: 18 (after the trade with Player 1) (Value: 12)\n- Brick: 5 (after the trade with Player 1) (Value: 29)\n- Ore: 8 (after the trade with Player 1) (Value: 33)\n\n**Trade Offers from Player 1:**\n- Offer: 1 Wood, 1 Ore -> Request: 9 Wheat (which you've rejected)\n\n**Considerations:**\n- The value of Wheat (6) is less than the value of the other resources on a per item basis.\n- Wood (9) and Ore (33) seem to hold more value than Wheat. \n\nYou have limited turns to increase your resource value. Since Player 1 is persistent with their offers, and as they\u2019re still interested in negotiating with you, you might want to come up with a counter-offer or shift the approach.\n\nYou could consider making a new trade offer that could benefit you without just simply denying the offer from Player 1.\n\n**Next Actions:**\nGiven the situation, I would suggest the following offer:\n``` \n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 5 Wheat]\n```\nThis offer allows you to leverage some of your Wood and one of your remaining Sheep for a higher quantity of Wheat, which could be advantageous moving forward, based on your current inventory. \n\nNow I'll proceed with the offer:\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep -> 5 Wheat]",
