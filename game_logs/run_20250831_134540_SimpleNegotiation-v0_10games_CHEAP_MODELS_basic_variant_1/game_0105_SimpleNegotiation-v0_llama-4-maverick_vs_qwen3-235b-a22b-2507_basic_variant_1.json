      "response": "To maximize the total value of my resources, I need to assess the current situation and determine the best course of action. Let's calculate the total value of my current resources:\n\n- Wheat: 18 * 6 = 108\n- Wood: 17 * 11 = 187\n- Sheep: 22 * 16 = 352\n- Brick: 9 * 25 = 225\n- Ore: 14 * 38 = 532\n\nTotal value = 108 + 187 + 352 + 225 + 532 = 1404\n\nThe resources I have are varied, but to increase the total value, I should look to trade resources that are relatively less valuable for those that are more valuable. Given the values, Wheat (6) is the least valuable, and Ore (38) is one of the most valuable.\n\nLet's examine potential trades:\n1. I could offer Wheat, which is the least valuable resource, in exchange for something more valuable.\n2. I have a relatively high quantity of Sheep (22), but it's still less valuable than Ore or Brick per unit.\n\nTo start, I'll make an offer that involves trading some of my less valuable resources for more valuable ones. Since Wheat is the least valuable, I'll start by offering Wheat.\n\n'[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 1 Brick]' \n\nThis offer is an attempt to trade 10 Wheat (value = 60) for 1 Brick (value = 25), which doesn't seem favorable at first glance due to the difference in value. However, it's a starting point to see if my opponent is willing to make a counteroffer or accept. Let's adjust the offer to be more reasonable and aim for a more valuable resource.\n\n'[Offer: 6 Wheat, 1 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' \n\nHere, I'm offering 6 Wheat (value = 36) and 1 Sheep (value = 16), totaling 52 in value, for 1 Ore (value = 38). This is still not a great trade for me, but it's a negotiation starting point.\n\nLet's refine this thought and make a more strategic first offer. I'll directly make a more appealing trade offer that involves resources with a bit more value.\n\n'[Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' \n\nIn this offer, I'm giving away 2 Wood (value = 22) and 2 Sheep (value = 32), totaling 54 in value, for 1 Ore (value = 38). This isn't a great trade for me, as I'm losing value. Let's rethink and make a different offer that could be more beneficial.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]' \n\nHere, I'm offering 4 Wheat (value = 24) for 1 Brick (value = 25), which is a slight improvement in value. Let's see if my opponent is interested.\n\nLet's wait for a response or a counteroffer from the opponent to proceed further. \n\nSince I need to follow the format and make a decision, I will make the last considered offer.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'",

Considering the values, I might want to offer some Wheat (Value: 6) or Wood (Value: 11) for a resource with a higher value.\n\nLet's make a new offer: '[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThis translates to: '[Offer: 5 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]' = '[Offer: 5*11 + 2*6 -> 1*38]' = '[Offer: 55 + 12 -> 38]' = '[Offer: 67 -> 38]'. Although this seems unfavorable at first glance, let's re-evaluate: I am giving up 5 Wood (Value: 55) and 2 Wheat (Value: 12), totaling 67, for 1 Ore (Value: 38). This is not a good trade.\n\nLet's rethink: I can try to offer some of my Wheat for Brick, as Brick has a higher value than Wheat.\n\n'[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'\n\nThis action makes sense because I'm offering 8 Wheat (Value: 8*6 = 48) for 1 Brick (Value: 25), which is still not a good trade.\n\nLet's think again: \n'[Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]' is another option, as Sheep has a lower value than Ore.\n\nThis translates to giving up 4 Sheep (4*16 = 64) for 1 Ore (38), which is not a good trade.\n\nAfter re-evaluation, a more reasonable trade would be:\n'[Offer: 2 Brick -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nHowever, I only have 9 Brick. Let's adjust the numbers.\n\n'[Offer: 1 Brick, 1 Ore -> 2 Ore]' is not valid since I'm requesting more Ore.\n\nLet's think about other alternatives.\n\n'[Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'.\n\nHere, I'm giving up 3 Wood (3*11 = 33) and 1 Wheat (6), totaling 39, for 1 Brick (25), which is still not a good trade.\n\nRethinking, I can make a more favorable trade.\n\n'[Offer: 15 Sheep -> 2 Ore, 1 Brick]' could be a potential offer.\n\nHere, I'm giving up 15 Sheep (15*16 = 240) for 2 Ore (2*38 = 76) and 1 Brick (25), totaling 101. This is not a good trade.\n\nHowever, \n'[Offer: 10 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Brick]'.\n\nHere, I'm giving up 10 Wheat (10*6 = 60) and 1 Wood (11), totaling 71, for 1 Brick (25).

The total value of my resources has changed. Let's calculate the new total value:\n\nInitial total value = (18 x 6) + (17 x 11) + (22 x 16) + (9 x 25) + (14 x 38) \n= 108 + 187 + 352 + 225 + 532 \n= 1404\n\nNew total value = (18 x 6) + (16 x 11) + (25 x 16) + (8 x 25) + (15 x 38) \n= 108 + 176 + 400 + 200 + 570 \n= 1454\n\nThe total value has increased by 50.\n\n**Next Turn:**\nSince the last trade was beneficial, let's continue to look for opportunities. I will examine my resources and think about a reasonable trade offer.\n\nI notice that I have a relatively large quantity of Sheep, and my Wood quantity is not very low. I can consider offering some Sheep or Wood to get more valuable resources.\n\nLet's make a new offer: [Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer is reasonable, as I'm offering 4 Sheep (4 x 16 = 64) for 1 Ore (1 x 38 = 38). Although it's not a great deal for me, it's worth trying.\n\nSo, my action for this turn is: [Offer: 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore]",
