      "response": "Based on the ongoing trade negotiations, let's summarize the current resources and values after the acceptance of Player 1's offer of 2 Wood for 1 Brick:\n\n### Current Resources and Values:\n- **Wheat**: Qty: 5 -> Total Value: 5\n- **Wood**: Qty: 14 -> Total Value: 8 (after giving away 2)\n- **Sheep**: Qty: 16 -> Total Value: 13\n- **Brick**: Qty: 6 -> Total Value: 162 (now gained 1 more brick)\n- **Ore**: Qty: 14 -> Total Value: 37\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n1. Player 0 currently has a surplus of Wheat and Wood but could benefit from acquiring more Ore or Brick.\n2. Player 1's offers suggest they might be more inclined to trade Wheat, but Player 0 may need to reevaluate their strategy to engage Player 1 in a trade that would enhance their resource value.\n\n**Next Step:**\nBased on the current situation, I will craft a trade offer to Player 1 that could benefit Player 0 while providing Player 1 with resources they currently desire.\n\n### New Offer to Player 1:\nI will offer them 5 Wheat in exchange for 1 Ore and 2 Brick, as it seems they are interested in Wheat based on previous offers.\n\n**Offer Format:**\n```\n[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Ore, 2 Brick]\n```",
