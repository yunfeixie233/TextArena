      "response": "### Strategic Analysis\n\n**Current Hand (Player 0):**\n- Wheat: 10 (5 value)\n- Wood: 21 (11 value)\n- Sheep: 15 (18 value)\n- Brick: 21 (21 value)\n- Ore: 24 (37 value)\n\n**Total Current Value:** 5 + 11 + 18 + 21 + 37 = 92\n\n### Goal\nMaximize total value by trading resources I have less use for (lower value or excess) for higher-value ones.\n\n### Resource Priorities\n- **Ore (37)**: The highest value per unit; I have a lot (24). Likely others will want Ore.\n- **Sheep (18)**: Moderate value; I have 15. Could be usable for trade.\n- **Brick (21)**: Highest marginal value per unit here. Getting more Brick is good.\n- **Wood (11)**:Low value; I have 21, which is a lot. Let's offload some.\n- **Wheat (5)**: Lowest value; excess 10 likely good to trade.\n\n### Initial Plan\n- **Trade away**: Wood and Wheat (low value/excess).\n- **Trade for**: Brick, Sheep, or Ore if the deal is good.\n\n### Turn 1: First Offer\nI should make an attractive first offer to start negotiations. Wood is low-value, and I have a lot. Let's offer excess Wood in exchange for Brick (highest marginal value).\n\n**Offer:**\n[Offer: 6 Wood -> 4 Brick, 1 Sheep]\n\nThis gives:\n- You give: 6 Wood (6 * 1 = 6 value)\n- You get: 4 Brick (4 * 1 = 4 value) + 1 Sheep (1.2 value) = 5.2 value net.\n\nNet value increase: 5.2 - 6 = -0.8 (but value is per unit, so this is moot since we're looking at total). Wait, the value per unit is fixed, so trades are about changing counts. The value is in gaining higher-unit-value items (Brick or Sheep) in exchange for lower-unit-value (Wood). The offer is 6 Wood (value 11) for 4 Brick (value 21) and 1 Sheep (value 18), which is a good deal for me (higher per-unit value received).\n\nLet me rephrase the offer to be clearer in terms of perceived loss/gain: giving 6 Wood (low value) for 4 Brick (high value) and 1 Sheep (moderate) is a fair-seeming start. \n\n[Offer: 6 Wood -> 4 Brick, 1 Sheep]",
