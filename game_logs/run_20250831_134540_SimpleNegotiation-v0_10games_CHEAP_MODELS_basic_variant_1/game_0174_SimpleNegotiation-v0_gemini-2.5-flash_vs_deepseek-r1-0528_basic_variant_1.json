      "response": "[Offer: 1 Wood -> 4 Wheat]\n\nThis is an interesting offer. Let's analyze it from Player 0's perspective.\n\n**Player 0's Resources (Initial):**\n* Wheat: 13 (Value: 5)\n* Wood: 6 (Value: 8)\n* Sheep: 11 (Value: 12)\n* Brick: 15 (Value: 30)\n* Ore: 23 (Value: 38)\n\n**Player 0's Offer (Previously):**\n* Offered: 3 Wheat (Value: 3 * 5 = 15)\n* Requested: 1 Wood (Value: 1 * 8 = 8)\n* *Goal: Gain 8 value for 15 value, a loss of 7. This offer was likely made to test the waters or if Player 0 was rich in Wheat and needed Wood.*\n\n**Player 1's Current Offer:**\n* Offered (to Player 0): 1 Wood (Value: 1 * 8 = 8)\n* Requested (from Player 0): 4 Wheat (Value: 4 * 5 = 20)\n\n**Analysis of Player 1's Offer:**\n* Player 0 is *receiving* 1 Wood (value 8).\n* Player 0 is *giving away* 4 Wheat (value 20).\n* **This trade would result in a net loss of 12 (8 - 20 = -12) for Player 0 in terms of value.**\n\nPlayer 0's objective is to *increase* the total value of resources. Accepting this offer would decrease the total value.\n\n**Therefore, Player 0 should deny this offer.**\n\nLet's consider what Player 0 might want to do next. Player 0 has a lot of Ore and Brick, which are high-value resources. Wheat and Wood are lower-value.\n\nPlayer 0's previous offer was a bad one (3 Wheat for 1 Wood). Player 1's counter-offer is also a bad one for Player 0 (1 Wood for 4 Wheat). Player 1 is trying to get more value out of Player 0.\n\nPlayer 0 has a lot of Brick and Ore. Player 0 might want to trade some excess low-value resources for higher-value ones, or try to get more high-value resources by trading low-value ones.\n\n**Possible Strategy for Player 0:**\nPlayer 0 has 13 Wheat, 6 Wood, 11 Sheep, 15 Brick, 23 Ore.\nPlayer 0 seems to have an abundance of Ore and Brick. They might be looking to diversify or get more of other resources, or simply offload low-value resources for more high-value ones.\n\nSince Player 1 denied the previous offer where Player 0 was offering 3 Wheat for 1 Wood, and now Player 1 is offering 1 Wood for 4 Wheat, there's a disconnect in their valuations or Player 1 is being aggressive.\n\nLet's try to make an offer that is slightly better for Player 0 than the original rejected offer, but also potentially more appealing to Player 1.\nOriginal P0 offer: 3 Wheat (V=15) for 1 Wood (V=8). (P0 loss of 7)\nP1 counter-offer: 1 Wood (V=8) for 4 Wheat (V=20). (P0 loss of 12)\n\nIf Player 0 is abundant in Wheat, they might still want Wood, but not at such a high cost.\n\nHow about trying to trade some high-value resources for other high-value resources, or a mix?\nPlayer 0 has a lot of Ore (23 Qty). What if Player 0 tries to get something valuable for 1 Ore?\n1 Ore Value = 38.\nWhat could 1 Ore get?\n* 4 Wood = 32\n* 5 Wood = 40 (close)\n* 3 Sheep = 36\n* 1 Brick = 30\n* 2 Brick = 60 (too much)\n\nLet's try to offer something good for Player 1 that also benefits Player 0.\nPlayer 0 rejected 1 Wood for 4 Wheat. This implies Player 0 values their Wheat more.\n\nLet's try to offer some of the abundant low-value Wheat for higher-value resources.\nPlayer 0 has 13 Wheat. They are open to trading Wheat.\nPlayer 1 seemed interested in Wood and Wheat.\n\nWhat if Player 0 offers 5 Wheat (Value 25) for 2 Wood (Value 16)? This is still a loss for Player 0 (25-16 = 9).\nWhat if Player 0 offers 5 Wheat (Value 25) for 1 Sheep (Value 12)? Another loss.\n\nPlayer 0 needs to make an offer that *increases* their total value.\n\nThe game is about trading to increase total value.\nPlayer 0 has an abundance of high-value resources (Ore, Brick). These are good for trading.\n\nLet's consider trading one of Player 0's most abundant resources, Ore.\nIf Player 0 trades 1 Ore (Value 38), they want to get something worth more than 38 in return.\nCould they get (for 1 Ore):\n* 1 Brick (30) + 1 Wood (8) = 38 (no gain)\n* 1 Brick (30) + 1 Sheep (12) = 42 (gain 4 for Player 0) - This is a good trade!\n\nLet's try to make an offer based on the analysis of Player 1's offer.\n\nPlayer 1 offered 1 Wood for 4 Wheat.\nPlayer 0 just denied it.\n\nNow, Player 0 has to make an offer.\nThe player instructions clearly state \"At each turn, you can talk to your opponent and make a trade offer.\"\nThe format is crucial: \"[Offer: Offered Resources -> Requested Resources]\" or \"[Accept]\" or \"[Deny]\".\n\nGiven Player 1's last offer, Player 0 should *deny* it because it's a value loss. Then, Player 0 should make a new offer.\n\nMy action will be to first deny Player 1's offer, and then propose a new offer that benefits Player 0.\n\n\"Player 1 made the following offer to Player 0: Offered items: 1 Wood -> Requested items: 4 Wheat\"\n\nMy response must be:\n[Deny]\nMy next prompt will be: Player 0 is making an offer.\n\nLet's craft the new offer.\nPlayer 0 has high quantity of Wheat (13), Brick (15), Ore (23).\nPlayer 0 has low quantity of Wood (6), Sheep (11).\n\nGoal: increase total value.\nScenario 1: Trade low-value for high-value.\nOffer: 3 Wheat (Value 15) -> 1 Sheep (Value 12). (Player 0 loss of 3) - Bad.\nOffer: 4 Wheat (Value 20) -> 1 Sheep (Value 12). (Player 0 loss of 8) - Bad.\n\nLet's reconsider the previous P0 offer: 3 Wheat -> 1 Wood (15 value out, 8 value in, -7 value for P0). It was rejected.\nP1 counter-offer: 1 Wood -> 4 Wheat (8 value out for P1, 20 value in for P1. For P0, 8 value in, 20 value out, -12 value for P0).\n\nPlayer 1 clearly values Wheat. Player 0 has plentiful Wheat.\nPlayer 0 needs to get more value back than what they give.\n\nLet's try to offer something from the plentiful high-value resources like Brick or Ore, to get something even better.\n\nOffer: 1 Brick (Value 30) -> 1 Sheep (Value 12) + 1 Wood (Value 8) + 1 Wheat (Value 5) = 25 (Player 0 loss of 5) - Bad.\n\nWhat if Player 0 offers 2 Wheat (Value 10) for 1 Wood (Value 8)? This is a loss of 2. Still bad.\nWhat if Player 0 offers 2 Wood (Value 16) for 1 Sheep (Value 12)? Loss of 4. Bad.\n\nIt's hard to make a trade where Player 0 gives low-value items and gets higher value back, unless the opponent is desperate. Given the previous turns, Player 1 seems to be trying to extract value.\n\nLet's pivot. Player 0 has a lot of Ore and Brick. These are excellent leverage.\nCan Player 0 offer a small amount of Ore/Brick for a significant amount of lower value goods?\nOr, offer Ore/Brick for *more* Ore/Brick from Player 1, assuming Player 1 has some. This is speculative.\n\nLet's try a balanced or slightly beneficial trade for Player 0.\nOffer: 1 Ore (Value 38) -> ?\n* 1 Ore for 2 Sheep (Value 24) + 1 Wood (Value 8) = 32 (Loss 6)\n* 1 Ore for 3 Sheep (Value 36) + 1 Wheat (Value 5) = 41 (Gain 3 for P0!) - This is a good offer for Player 0.\n    * Player 0 has 23 Ore, so giving up 1 is fine.\n    * Player 0 has 11 Sheep, getting 3 more would be good.\n    * Player 0 has 13 Wheat, getting 1 more is also good.\n\nThis trade seems plausible for Player 0 as it increases overall value.\n[Offer: 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat]\n\nNow, let's consider Player 1's perspective on this offer briefly.\nPlayer 1 would be giving up 3 Sheep (Value 36) and 1 Wheat (Value 5) for 1 Ore (Value 38).\nTotal value given by Player 1: 41. Total value received by Player 1: 38.\nPlayer 1 would be making a loss of 3.\n\nThis isn't likely to be accepted by Player 1 unless Player 1 desperately needs Ore, or has an abundance of Sheep/Wheat and undervalues them compared to Ore.\n\nThis game is tricky. You want to make an offer that is accepted AND beneficial to you.\nThe previous turns suggest Player 1 is trying to get value from Player 0.\n\nLet's reconsider. Player 0 denied Player 1's offer. That shows Player 0 isn't desperate.\nPlayer 0 probably wants to get Wood or Sheep, as their quantities are lower.\n\nWhat if Player 0 offers some combination of resources they have excess of, to get resources they have less of, and still make a profit?\n\nTotal value of Player 0's current resources:\nWheat: 13 * 5 = 65\nWood: 6 * 8 = 48\nSheep: 11 * 12 = 132\nBrick: 15 * 30 = 450\nOre: 23 * 38 = 874\nTotal: 1569\n\nLet's re-evaluate the previous rejected offer made by Player 0: 3 Wheat -> 1 Wood\nP0 offered 3 Wheat (Value 15) to get 1 Wood (Value 8). This was a bad deal for P0. P1 rejected.\n\nPlayer 1's counter: 1 Wood -> 4 Wheat.\nP1 offered 1 Wood (Value 8) to get 4 Wheat (Value 20). This was an even worse deal for P0 (loss of 12). P0 should deny.\n\nOkay, so Player 1 wants Wheat. Player 0 has Wheat.\nPlayer 0 has 13 Wheat. If Player 0 can get something decent for Wheat, it would be good.\nLet's try to reverse Player 1's last offer, but make it beneficial for Player 0.\n\nP1 offered 1 Wood for 4 Wheat.\nWhat if P0 offers 3 Wheat for 1 Wood? This was already rejected and bad for P0.\nWhat if P0 offers 2 Wheat (Value 10) for 1 Wood (Value 8)? Still bad (loss of 2).\n\nThis suggests Player 1 values Wood highly, and Wheat less.\n\nLet's try to offer a more \"fair\" trade from Player 0's perspective, but still a gain.\nWhat if P0 offers a combination of low-value and high-value, to get higher value?\n\nThis is a very common strategy in Catan-like games: Trade something you have a lot of for something you need, even if it's not a direct value-for-value trade, if it enables a future high-value gain (e.g., building a city for victory points). Here, it's just about direct value gain.\n\nLet's try to trade one of the abundant Ores (Value 38) for something that adds more value.\nGiven that P1 seems to be looking for value from P0.\n\nHow about a trade for resources P0 has less of?\nP0 has 6 Wood and 11 Sheep.\n\nOffer: 1 Ore (Value 38) -> 4 Sheep (Value 48).\n    * P0 gives: 1 Ore (Value 38)\n    * P0 receives: 4 Sheep (Value 48)\n    * P0 Net Gain: 10\n    * P1 Perspective: Giving 4 Sheep (Value 48) for 1 Ore (Value 38). P1 Net Loss: 10.\nThis is a great trade for P0, but terrible for P1. P1 would likely deny this.\n\nWe need to make an offer that is *slightly* beneficial to P0, and maybe slightly detrimental or neutral to P1. This makes it more likely to be accepted.\n\nLet's try to target a smaller gain for P0.\nIf P0 offers 1 Ore (Value 38).\nPossible returns for P0 to gain value from:\n* 1 Brick (Value 30)\n* 1 Sheep (Value 12)\n* 1 Wood (Value 8)\n* 1 Wheat (Value 5)\n\nConsider an offer where Player 0 loses some Wheat (plentiful) and gains something useful.\nOffer: 5 Wheat (Value 25) -> 2 Sheep (Value 24) + 1 Wood (Value 8).\n    * P0 Gives: 5 Wheat (Value 25)\n    * P0 Receives: 2 Sheep (Value 24) + 1 Wood (Value 8) = 32\n    * P0 Net Gain: 7\n    * P1 Perspective: P1 Gives 2 Sheep (Value 24) + 1 Wood (Value 8) = 32. P1 Receives 5 Wheat (Value 25). P1 Net Loss: 7.\nThis is still bad for P1.\n\nLet's consider Player 1's last offer again: 1 Wood -> 4 Wheat. P1 wants 4 Wheat for 1 Wood.\nThis means P1 values 1 Wood more than 4 Wheat.\nValue of 1 Wood = 8. Value of 4 Wheat = 20.\nSo P1 thinks 8 > 20, which is incorrect by raw value, but P1 might be resource-constrained or has a different valuation for Wheat.\n\nIf Player 1 wants Wheat, Player 0 has Wheat.\nLet's make a small gain for P0, by leveraging their excess Wheat.\nOffer: 3 Wheat (Value 15) -> 1 Brick (Value 30).\n    * P0 Gives: 3 Wheat (Value 15)\n    * P0 Receives: 1 Brick (Value 30)\n    * P0 Net Gain: 15.\n    * P1 Perspective: P1 Gives 1 Brick (Value 30). P1 Receives 3 Wheat (Value 15). P1 Net Loss: 15.\nThis is excellent for Player 0, but highly unlikely to be accepted by Player 1.\n\nThe most likely path to acceptance is to offer something Player 1 seemingly wants (Wheat, or goods lower than Ore/Brick from Player 1's perspective) and get something back that benefits Player 0.\n\nLet's try to be fair or slightly in favor of P0.\nP0's starting bad offer: 3 Wheat (15) for 1 Wood (8). Rejected.\nP1's counter-bad offer for P0: 1 Wood (8) for 4 Wheat (20).\n\nLet's make an offer involving items that Player 0 has a lot of.\n* Wheat: 13\n* Brick: 15\n* Ore: 23\n\nWhat if Player 0 aims for an even trade, but of resources Player 0 prefers?\nFor example, exchange something for Sheep, since Sheep quantity is lower for P0.\nOffer: 1 Brick (Value 30) -> 2 Sheep (Value 24) + 1 Wood (Value 8) = 32.\n    * P0 Gives: 1 Brick (Value 30)\n    * P0 Receives: 2 Sheep (Value 24) + 1 Wood (Value 8) = 32\n    * P0 Net Gain: 2\n    * P1 Perspective: P1 Gives 2 Sheep (Value 24) + 1 Wood (Value 8) = 32. P1 Receives 1 Brick (Value 30). P1 Net Loss: 2.\nThis is a very slight loss for P1. It might be accepted if P1 has a lot of Sheep and Wood and needs Brick.\nThis seems like a reasonable offer to test the waters and gain slight value for P0.\n\nLet's try this. First, deny the bad offer from P1. Then, make a new offer that is slightly beneficial to P0 and potentially acceptable to P1.\n\nResponse will be two lines:\n1. Deny the last offer.\n2. Make a new offer.\n\n```\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 1 Brick -> 2 Sheep, 1 Wood]\n```",
