I have plenty of Wheat and Wood.\nLet's try to offer some Wheat and Wood for some higher-value items.\nI'll offer a good chunk of my lower-value resources trying to get a decent amount of Brick or Ore.\nLet's offer 10 Wheat and 5 Wood. This is (10 * 6) + (5 * 10) = 60 + 50 = 110 value.\nWhat can I get for that?\n2 Brick and 1 Ore would be (2 * 27) + (1 * 40) = 54 + 40 = 94. This means I would still be losing value.\nHow about a direct swap of abundant low value for high value?\nI have a lot of Wheat and Wood.

I also have plenty of Ore and Brick. I'm low on Sheep.\n\nLet's make an offer where I give away some of my plentiful low-value resources for higher-value ones.\nI'll offer 15 Wheat (15 * 6 = 90) and 5 Wood (5 * 10 = 50). Total 140 value.\nWhat do I want for that?\nI'd like to get something high value.\nMaybe 3 Brick (3 * 27 = 81) and 1 Ore (1 * 40 = 40). This is a total of 121. I'm losing value.\nI need to make a profit.\nHow about I target specific items that are more valuable?\n\nLet's re-evaluate player 0's offers. Player 0 previously offered 5 Sheep, 3 Wheat -> 3 Brick, 2 Ore.\nValue offered by P0: (5*13) + (3*6) = 65+18 = 83.\nValue requested by P0: (3*27) + (2*40) = 81+80 = 161.\nThis implies P0 would gain 161-83 = 78. This was a bad deal for me.\n\nThe current offer from P0: 4 Sheep, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick, 1 Ore.\nValue offered by P0: (4*13) + (1*10) = 52 + 10 = 62.\nValue requested by P0: (2*27) + (1*40) = 54 + 40 = 94.\nThis means P0 wants to gain 94-62 = 32. This is also a bad deal for me.\n\nI need to make an offer that increases *my* value.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Wood. Player 0 seems to want Sheep, based on their offers. I have only 5 Sheep, so I'm very reluctant to give them away.\n\nLet's try to get more Sheep from player 0, or more Brick/Ore.\nI have vast amounts of Wheat and Wood.\nHow about: I offer some Wheat and Wood and request Sheep from P0.\nOffer: 15 Wheat, 10 Wood (Value: (15*6) + (10*10) = 90 + 100 = 190)\nRequest: 5 Sheep (Value: 5 * 13 = 65), and 3 Brick (Value: 3 * 27 = 81). Total 146. Still losing value.\n\nI want to give away low value items (Wheat, Wood) and gain high value items (Ore, Brick, or perhaps Sheep).\nLet's make an offer where I give away plenty of Wheat and Wood, for a small amount of Ore/Brick.\nOffer: 12 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 1 Ore, 2 Brick\nValue offered: (12 * 6) + (10 * 10) = 72 + 100 = 172\nValue requested: (1 * 40) + (2 * 27) = 40 + 54 = 94\nThis is losing me value.\n\nI need to make an offer that is good for me.\nI have plenty of Wood and Wheat. Let's try to make an offer where I gain value.\n\nLet's offer a lot of Wood and Wheat for Ore.\n[Offer: 20 Wheat, 15 Wood -> 3 Ore]\nValue of offered items: (20 * 6) + (15 * 10) = 120 + 150 = 270\nValue of requested items: (3 * 40) = 120\nThis is a loss for me.\n\nWhat if I ask for a small amount of value (that also increases my qty of low items) and give away a lot? No, that's not the goal.\nI need to make a profitable trade for myself.\n\nLet's assume Player 0 is also trying to make a profit.\nI'll offer something where I aim for a small profit, or at least break even, while getting resources I want.\nI'm low on Sheep. I have plenty of Wheat and Wood. I also have plenty of Brick and Ore.\nWhat if I trade some of my Wood for Sheep?\n[Offer: 10 Wood -> 5 Sheep]\nValue offered: 10 * 10 = 100\nValue requested: 5 * 13 = 65\nI am losing value here.\n\nI will offer something where the value I receive is higher than the value I offer.\nI have plenty of Wheat and Wood.\nLet's offer some Wheat for Ore. Ore is high value.\n[Offer: 15 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nValue offered: 15 * 6 = 90\nValue requested: 1 * 40 = 40\nThis also makes me lose value.\n\nI need to gain value or at least break even.\nI will offer Brick for Ore, since I have plenty of Brick too.\n[Offer: 3 Brick -> 2 Ore]\nValue offered: 3 * 27 = 81\nValue requested: 2 * 40 = 80\nThis is almost a break-even for me, but slightly negative. Not good.\n\nI need to think differently. I want to increase my *total* value.\nI have a significant amount of all resources, except Sheep.\nWhat if I offer a balanced trade where I still earn value?\n\nI target my most abundant valuable resources (Ore and Brick) and my most abundant low-value resources (Wheat and Wood).\nMy current value: (23*6) + (23*10) + (5*13) + (12*27) + (14*40) = 138 + 230 + 65 + 324 + 560 = 1317.\n\nLet's try to get more Ore, as it's the highest value resource.\nI'll offer a lot of Wheat and Wood for Ore.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 8 Wood -> 1 Ore, 1 Brick]\nValue offered: (10 * 6) + (8 * 10) = 60 + 80 = 140\nValue requested: (1 * 40) + (1 * 27) = 40 + 27 = 67\nThis is a bad trade for me.\n\nI need to make a profit.\nI will offer some of my abundant Wheat for some rarer Sheep.\n[Offer: 10 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]\nValue offered: 10 * 6 = 60\nValue requested: 2 * 13 = 26\nThis is a bad trade for me.\n\nI will try to make a profitable offer.\nI am low on Sheep. I have plenty of other items.\n\nLet's try to get Ore by giving up Wheat and Wood.\n[Offer: 20 Wheat, 10 Wood -> 2 Ore]\nValue offered: (20 * 6) + (10 * 10) = 120 + 100 = 220\nValue requested: 2 * 40 = 80\nThis is a clear loss for me.\n\nI will try an offer where I can gain value.\nI will offer some of my Brick for more valuable Ore.\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 4 Ore]\nValue offered: 5 * 27 = 135\nValue requested: 4 * 40 = 160\nThis would increase my value by (160 - 135 = 25). This is a good trade for me.\nI have 12 Brick, so giving 5 is acceptable. I have 14 Ore, so getting 4 more is great.\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 4 Ore]",
