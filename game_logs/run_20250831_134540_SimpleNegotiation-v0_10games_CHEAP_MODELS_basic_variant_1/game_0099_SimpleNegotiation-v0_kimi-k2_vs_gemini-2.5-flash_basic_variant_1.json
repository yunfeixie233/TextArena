      "response": "Alright, let\u2019s pause and take stock before we begin turn 10 (our last chance to act).\n\nCurrent Inventory (after last trade)\n\nWheat  : 12 + 15 = 27  \nWood   : 13 \u2212 1 = 12 (you gave away 1 Wood in the 4-B-for-15-W trade, not 1 Wood received)  \nSheep  : 9  \nBrick  : 14 \u2212 4 = 10  \nOre    : 17 (unchanged so far)\n\nCurrent total point value:\n\n27\u00b75  + 12\u00b78 + 9\u00b712 + 10\u00b723 + 17\u00b737\n= 135 + 96 + 108 + 230 + 629\n= 1 198\n\nYour two major priorities at this final stage:\n\n1. Make sure every resource token ends up in its highest-value form before the game ends (Ore \u2192 37, Brick \u2192 23, Sheep \u2192 12, Wood \u2192 8, Wheat \u2192 5).  \n2. Realise that no more offers are incoming from P1 today (they \u201cmade no new trade offer\u201d).\n\nThe opportunity still on the table\nP1 is still tentatively offering  \n[Offered: 15 Sheep \u2192 Requested: 3 Ore, 1 Wood]\n\nQuick valuation of that deal:\n\n- What you would send away  \n 3 Ore  = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111  \n 1 Wood = 1 \u00d7 8  = 8  \n Total given up = 119\n\n- What you would get  \n 15 Sheep = 15 \u00d7 12 = 180\n\nNet gain = 180 \u2212 119 = +61 points.\n\nIt\u2019s the only possible deal still alive, and it is worth +61 to you. There is nothing else to haggle over in the remaining turns: we\u2019re literally at the final offer window.\n\nSince no new offers have appeared or are expected, the strictly utility-maximising action is to accept what improves your score.\n\n[Accept]",
