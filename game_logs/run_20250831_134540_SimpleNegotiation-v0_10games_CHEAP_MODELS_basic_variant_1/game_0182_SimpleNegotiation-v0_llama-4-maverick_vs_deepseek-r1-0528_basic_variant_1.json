Ore is highly valued, so giving away Wheat for other resources could be beneficial if the deal is right.\n\nGiven the last offer was not beneficial and considering our resources and their values, let's directly make a new offer that might be more beneficial.\n\n**Offer:**  \nWe have Ore (high value) and can afford to give some away for a resource that might increase our total value. Let's consider offering Ore for Brick or Sheep since they are less valued than Ore but still valuable.\n\nLet's make an offer:  \n`[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick]`  \n- Giving away 2 Ore = 2 * 35 = 70  \n- Receiving 3 Brick = 3 * 28 = 84  \n- Net gain = 84 - 70 = 14 (positive, so potentially beneficial)\n\nThus, my action for this turn is:  \n`[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick]`",

We need to assess the previous trades and counter-offers.\n\nFrom the previous interactions:\n- We tried to exchange Wheat for Ore or Brick, but Player 1 rejected those offers.\n- Player 1 tried to exchange Brick for Wheat (and sometimes Wood), but we rejected those offers.\n- We also tried to exchange Ore for Brick, but it was rejected.\n\nLet's directly examine our resources and see if we can make a reasonable offer. \n\nOur most valuable resource is Ore (Value: 35), and we have a significant quantity of it. We could try to exchange some Ore for other resources that are relatively valuable or underrepresented in our inventory.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some Ore for Brick since Brick is the second most valuable resource we have, and we have already tried to get it directly.\n\nHowever, since we've already made an offer for Ore -> Brick and it was rejected, let's analyze the values again.\n\nWe have:\n- Total Value = (20*5) + (8*11) + (19*15) + (10*28) + (25*35)\n- Total Value = 100 + 88 + 285 + 280 + 875 = 1628\n\nA potential offer could be:\n[Offer: 2 Ore -> 1 Brick, 1 Sheep]\n\nLet's calculate the value of this offer:\n- Offered: 2 Ore = 2 * 35 = 70\n- Requested: 1 Brick + 1 Sheep = 28 + 15 = 43\n\nThis offer doesn't seem beneficial as we're losing value (70 > 43). Let's adjust.\n\nConsidering the values and our goal, we can make a different offer. Since we've been trying to get Brick and it's valuable, let's think about what we can offer that's less valuable but might be acceptable.\n\nAn alternative:\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick]\n\n- Offered: 5 Wheat + 1 Wood = (5*5) + (1*11) = 25 + 11 = 36\n- Requested: 2 Brick = 2 * 28 = 56\n\nThis trade seems beneficial as we're gaining value (56 > 36).\n\nLet's make this offer.\n\n[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Brick]",
