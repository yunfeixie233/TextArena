Ore is highly valued at 40. Trading resources other than Ore for more Ore or keeping Ore is a good strategy.\n2. Brick is also valuable at 29. Acquiring more Brick is beneficial.\n\nGiven the values, a straightforward trade isn't obvious without knowing the opponent's resources. However, we can still make an educated guess.\n\nI'll start by offering to trade some of my less valuable resources for more valuable ones. Let's say I offer some Wheat and Wood for Brick or Ore, as these are high-value resources.\n\nMy first action will be to send an offer: \n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 4 Wood -> 3 Brick]'\n\nThis offer is an attempt to trade lower-value resources (Wheat and Wood) for a higher-value resource (Brick). \n\nLet's see how the opponent responds. \n\nPlease proceed with the game.",

Player1 made another offer: 4 Wheat, 2 Brick -> 5 Wood. I accepted it.\n   - I gained 5 Wood and lost 4 Wheat, 2 Brick.\n   - New quantities:\n     + [Wheat] Qty: 9 - 4 = 5\n     + [Wood] Qty: 11 + 5 = 16\n     + [Brick] Qty: 28 - 2 = 26\n5. Player1 made an offer: 4 Wood -> 2 Brick.\n   - To evaluate this, let's compare the values:\n     + Offering 4 Wood = 4 * 8 = 32\n     + Requesting 2 Brick = 2 * 29 = 58\n   - Since 58 > 32, this is a good deal for me.\n\nLet's check my current resources:\n+ [Wheat] Qty:5 Value:6\n+ [Wood] Qty:16 Value:8\n+ [Sheep] Qty:14 Value:15\n+ [Brick] Qty:26 Value:29\n+ [Ore] Qty:16 Value:40\n\nI will accept the offer since it's beneficial.\n\nMy response will be: [Accept]",
