Improve the **marginal utility per card**.  \n   Sheep value (16) is the lowest among the five resources left in my hand.  \n   Ore value (37) is the highest, but I already have a lot (13 vs. initial 6).  \n   Wood & Brick value (9 & 27) are middling, and Wheat (5) is even lower.\n\n2. Cheap Sheep still in hand: only 3 cards, so the big sheep dump is over. My leverage there is gone.\n\n3. Next priorities  \n   - Reduce Wheat stack (value 5) \u2013 ideally swap toward anything higher.  \n   - Improve Wood (9) part toward Brick or Ore.  \n   - Don\u2019t overstock Ore unless I can realistically flip it for an even higher asset.\n\n--------------------------\nConcrete offer at this point\n\nI still have 3 Sheep left; **they have the same 16 value for me but are now HEAVILY scarce for me, so I should NOT offer more Sheep.** Keep those 3 Sheep.\n\nWilling to part with Wheat (5) or Wood (9). Wheat is the obvious offer to rid of.\n\nI estimate Player 0 values Brick and Ore highly (they offered 2 Ore for 7 Sheep earlier).  \nGive them Wheat, ask for either Brick or Ore.\n\n[Offer: 10 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick, 4 Ore]",
