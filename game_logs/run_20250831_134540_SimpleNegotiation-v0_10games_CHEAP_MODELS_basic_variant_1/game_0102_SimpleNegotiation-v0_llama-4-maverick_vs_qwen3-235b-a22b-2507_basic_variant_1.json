      "response": "### Current Resources and Values\n- [Wheat]: Qty: 5, Value: 6\n- [Wood]: Qty: 9, Value: 10\n- [Sheep]: Qty: 7, Value: 15\n- [Brick]: Qty: 21, Value: 29\n- [Ore]: Qty: 14, Value: 36\n\n### Total Current Value\nTo determine the total current value, we calculate:  \n(5 * 6) + (9 * 10) + (7 * 15) + (21 * 29) + (14 * 36)  \n= 30 + 90 + 105 + 609 + 504  \n= 1338\n\n### Initial Strategy\nThe goal is to increase the total value of resources through trades. To achieve this, we should look to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but potentially more valuable in future trades.\n\n### Observations\n- The highest value resource I have is [Ore] with a value of 36.\n- The lowest value resource I have is [Wheat] with a value of 6.\n\n### Trade Strategy for Turn 1\nTo start, I'll look to trade [Wheat] for a resource that could potentially increase my total value. Since [Wheat] has the lowest value, getting rid of it could be beneficial if I receive something of higher or comparable total value.\n\n### Proposed Trade for Turn 1\nI'll offer 5 [Wheat] in exchange for resources that could increase my total value. A reasonable trade could involve getting [Sheep] or [Wood] since they are of moderate value. Let's propose a trade that could be attractive to the opponent.\n\n### Trade Offer\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Sheep, 1 Wood]'  \nThis trade offers 5 [Wheat] (total value = 5 * 6 = 30) for 1 [Sheep] (value = 15) and 1 [Wood] (value = 10), totaling 25. While this doesn't immediately increase my total value (since 30 is being exchanged for 25), it's a starting point. However, upon reconsideration, this trade actually decreases my total value.\n\nLet's reconsider the trade to ensure it increases my total value.\n\n### Reconsidered Trade Offer\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat -> 3 Wood]'  \nThis trade offers 5 [Wheat] (total value = 30) for 3 [Wood] (total value = 3 * 10 = 30). This maintains my total value but doesn't increase it.\n\n### Alternative Reconsidered Trade Offer\n'[Offer: 5 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 2 Sheep]'  \nThis trade offers 5 [Wheat] (total value = 30) and 1 [Wood] (value = 10), totaling 40, for 2 [Sheep] (total value = 2 * 15 = 30). This trade slightly decreases my total value.\n\n### Better Trade Offer\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'  \nThis trade offers 2 [Wheat] (total value = 2 * 6 = 12) for 1 [Ore] (value = 36). This significantly increases my total value.\n\n### Action for Turn 1\n'[Offer: 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'  \n\nLet's execute this trade offer and see the response from the opponent.",

To maximize my resources, I should try to make a trade that increases my total value.\n\n**New Offer:**\nTo increase my total value, I should try to get resources with higher value or offer resources with lower value. \nOne possible trade is to offer some Wheat (Value: 6) and/or Wood (Value: 10) for a resource with a higher value.\n\nLet's make a new offer: [Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]\n\n**Action:** [Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",
