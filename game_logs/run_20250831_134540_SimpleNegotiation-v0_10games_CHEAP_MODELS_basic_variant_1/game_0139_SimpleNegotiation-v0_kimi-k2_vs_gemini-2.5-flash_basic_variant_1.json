I also have a decent amount of Wheat. Sheep and Ore are more valuable.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore. Player 0 has been trying to get Brick.\n\nI could try offering some Brick and some Sheep for some Ore.\nOr I could try offering some Wood for some Ore.\n\nLet's consider Player 0's previous offers: 5 Wheat for 2 Brick, then 6 Wheat for 3 Brick. This suggests they want Brick or are willing to trade Wheat for it.\n\nInstead of only targeting Ore, I could offer some Wood and/or Wheat to try and get Brick or even Sheep.\n\nLet's re-evaluate what I previously tried: 2 Sheep (32 value) for 1 Ore (35 value). This was a small gain for Player 0, and they still rejected it. Maybe they don't want Sheep.\n\nIf Player 0 is looking for Brick, and I have 23 Brick, I could potentially offer some.\n\nLet's try to trade more Wood. I have 25 Wood. Wood is low value.\nWhat if I offer a larger quantity of Wood for a smaller quantity of something more valuable?\n\nLet's try to get Ore again, as it's the highest value resource.\n\nPerhaps 3 Wood and 1 Wheat for 1 Ore?\n3 Wood: 3 * 8 = 24\n1 Wheat: 1 * 5 = 5\nTotal: 29\n1 Ore: 1 * 35\nThis would be a good trade for me (gain of 6 value). Player 0 might accept if they need Wood/Wheat.\n\nWhat about something for Brick?\nOffer: 5 Wood -> 1 Brick\n5 Wood: 5 * 8 = 40\n1 Brick: 1 * 26\nThis loses me 14 in value. No.\n\nLet's stick to trying to get Ore or Sheep, ideally for Wheat or Wood.\n\nWhat if I counter with an offer that includes something they've shown interest in (Brick), but still benefits me?\n\nThey offered 6 Wheat for 3 Brick (Wheat value 30, Brick value 78). They offered to get 3 Brick in exchange for 6 Wheat. This means they value Brick more than Wheat, and maybe they want more Brick.\n\nOffer: 2 Brick, 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore\n2 Brick: 2 * 26 = 52\n3 Wheat: 3 * 5 = 15\nTotal: 67\n1 Ore: 1 * 35\nThis is a bad trade for me.\n\nLet's try something simple and beneficial. I have plenty of Wood.\n\nOffer: 4 Wood -> 1 Ore\n4 Wood: 4 * 8 = 32\n1 Ore: 1 * 35\nThis is a small gain for me (3 value). Let's see if Player 0 will accept a slightly unfavorable trade for them.
