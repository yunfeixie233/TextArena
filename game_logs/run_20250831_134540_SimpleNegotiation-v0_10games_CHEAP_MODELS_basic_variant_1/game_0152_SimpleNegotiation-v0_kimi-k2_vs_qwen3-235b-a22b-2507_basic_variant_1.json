Net value for me: \u2013111 +136 = +25. That was good for me, bad for Player 1\u2013no surprise it was denied.\n\n2) My rejected offer: 4 Wood (12\u00d74 = 48), 5 Wheat (6\u00d75 = 30) = 78 \u2192 for 4 Brick (20\u00d74 = 80), 3 Sheep (18\u00d73 = 54) = 134. Net value for me: \u201378 +134 = +56. Again strongly favorable to me.\n\n3) My rejected offer: 8 Wheat (6\u00d78 = 48), 2 Brick (20\u00d72 = 40) = 88 \u2192 for 5 Sheep (18\u00d75 = 90), 2 Ore (32\u00d72 = 64) = 154. Net value for me: \u201388 +154 = +66. Again I was asking too much.\n\n4) Player 1\u2019s rejected offer: 7 Wheat (6\u00d77 = 42), 1 Wood (12) = 54 \u2192 for 4 Sheep (18\u00d74 = 72), 1 Ore (32) = 104. Net value for me: +54 \u2013104 = \u201350. That cost me 50 value; correctly denied.\n\nLesson learned: I\u2019ve been asking unbalanced trades. Now that only 4 turns remain, I must create an exchange that is roughly fair (slightly favorable to me) and uses what I have most of and what I value least.\n\nI value Wheat the least (6 per unit) and I have 24 of it. Brick is middle (20) and I have 24. Ore is most valuable (32) and I have 14. Sheep is also high (18) and I have 14.\n\nI\u2019ll give up low-value surplus to upgrade into more Ore without hurting myself badly.\n\nI will offer 6 Wheat and 3 Wood (total value 6\u00d76 + 3\u00d712 = 36 + 36 = 72) in exchange for 3 Ore and 3 Brick (total value 3\u00d732 + 3\u00d720 = 96 + 60 = 156). Net value for me: \u201372 +156 = +84, i.e. still skewed in my favor. Let me ease it to something Player 1 might accept while I still come out slightly ahead.\n\nFairer proposal: 5 Wheat (30) plus 3 Wood (36) = 66, for 2 Ore (64) plus 2 Brick (40) = 104 \u2192 +38 for me. That\u2019s closer to even.\n\nSlightly more even: 5 Wheat (30) + 3 Brick (60) \u2192 for 2 Ore (64) + 2 Sheep (36). Net value: \u201390 +100 = +10.
