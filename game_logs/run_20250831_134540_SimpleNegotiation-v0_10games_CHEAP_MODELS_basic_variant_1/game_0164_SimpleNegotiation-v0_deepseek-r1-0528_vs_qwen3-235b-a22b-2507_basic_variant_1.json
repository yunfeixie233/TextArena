I propose sacrificing one ore to gain both a brick and a sheep. Although ore is high-value, this trade is calculated to net me a gain:\n\n- Trade: 1 Ore (39) \u2192 1 Brick (28) & 1 Sheep (15)  \n  - My change: -63 (39 ore worth) + 106 (28 brick + 15 sheep worth) = **+3 gain**  \n\nThis approach is reasonable since Player 1 may be more inclined to trade if they hold surplus bricks or sheep.
