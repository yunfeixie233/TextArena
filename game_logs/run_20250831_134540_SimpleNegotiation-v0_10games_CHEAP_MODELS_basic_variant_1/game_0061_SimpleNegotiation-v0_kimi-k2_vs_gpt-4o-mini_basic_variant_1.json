Avoid trading away Wheat and Wood as they have lower total values compared to Sheep.\n\n### First Offer:\nTrade some Sheep and Ore for Brick. Given Brick's high value, aim to give slightly less in value than what you receive.\n\n**Proposed Trade:**\n- Give: 3 Sheep (3 * 0.625 = 1.875 value) + 2 Ore (2 * 1.762 \u2248 3.524)\n  - Total given value \u2248 5.4\n- Receive: 5 Brick (5 * 1.867 \u2248 9.335)\n  - Net gain \u2248 +3.9 value\n\nThis seems favorable.\n\n[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Brick, 2 Sheep] \n\nWait, the format seems to include \"2 Sheep\" on the receiving side, which doesn't make sense (may be a typo in the example).

      "response": "After the first profitable trade, turns 2-5 have been spent fruitlessly trying to swap Brick for Ore at declining ratios (4:4\u21923:3\u21923) or worse.  \nI got a lot of Brick in the first exchange, but my last offers were rejected and the market-value difference is too large to make Brick-for-Ore converts attractive to Player 1.\n\nIn the new positions after both of our lines of trades, Player 1 is probably long on Ore and/or short on Brick, which is exactly why my Brick-for-Ore offers keep failing.  I still have 28 Brick (more than I need) and 39 Ore (also plenty), while I\u2019m short on Wood and Wheat.  \nI should switch to something Player 1 might actually accept and that improves my own net value.\n\nCurrent values (marginal):\nBrick 28 per 15  \u2192 1.867 each  \nOre    39 per 37 \u2192 1.026 each  \nWood    6 per 9  \u2192 1.500 each  \nWheat   6 per 5  \u2192 0.833 each  \nSheep  21 per 15 \u2192 0.714 each  \n\nA Brick-for-Wood deal is value-positive for me (Brick > Wood), yet Wood is high-value tech for many players.  \nOffering 2 Brick for 2 Wood gives Player 1 a small average value gain (they mostly value Wood above Brick) but keeps me clearly ahead on per-unit value. That should entice Player 1 where straight-resource valuations might have burnt out their trust.\n\n[Offer: 2 Brick, 1 Sheep -> 2 Wood, 1 Wheat]",
