You have a high quantity of Ore, which has a high value but might be appealing to trade for even more valuable resources.\n2. Brick has the highest total value among your current resources. \n\nPotential Trades:\n1. Since you need to increase your total value, consider trading Ore (there\u2019s no need to hoard it) for Brick or Sheep, as they can sometimes be harder to gather.\n2. You could offer a small quantity of Ore for a larger quantity of a lower-value but still desired resource.\n\nLet\u2019s make a trade offer. \n\n**Trade Offer:**\nLet's offer 4 Ore (Value: 132) to potentially gain 5 Brick (Value: 145) since trading for Brick, which has a high value, will increase your resources.\n\n**Proposed Trade:**\n[Offer: 4 Ore -> 5 Brick] \n\nNow, I will wait for the opponent's response.",
