      "response": "### Initial Analysis\n\n**Current Resources and Values:**\n- **Wheat:** 11 units, total value = 6\n- **Wood:** 6 units, total value = 8\n- **Sheep:** 22 units, total value = 17\n- **Brick:** 18 units, total value = 28\n- **Ore:** 8 units, total value = 32\n\n**Total Current Value:** 6 + 8 + 17 + 28 + 32 = 91\n\n**Observations:**\n1. **Sheep:** I have a lot of sheep (22 units) but the total value is only 17, which seems low compared to other resources. This suggests sheep might be undervalued or I have excess.\n2. **Ore:** High value per unit (32 total for 8 units = 4 per unit), but I have only 8. Might be good to acquire more if possible.\n3. **Brick:** Decent value (28 for 18 units \u2248 1.56 per unit), but I have a lot (18). Could be a good trade asset.\n4. **Wheat and Wood:** Lower quantities and values, might not be the focus for trades.\n\n**Potential Strategy:**\n- **Trade away excess Sheep and Brick** since I have a lot and their per-unit value isn't the highest.\n- **Acquire more Ore** as it has the highest per-unit value.\n- **Balance resources** to maximize total value.\n\n### Turn 1: Initial Offer\n\nI should start by offering some of my excess Sheep and Brick to get higher-value resources like Ore.\n\n**Offer Idea:**\n- Give: 5 Sheep, 3 Brick\n- Get: 3 Ore, 2 Wheat\n\nBut I need to check if this increases my total value.\n\n**Calculating Value Change:**\n- **Give away:** 5 Sheep (value per unit \u2248 17/22 \u2248 0.77) \u2192 5 * 0.77 \u2248 3.85\n  3 Brick (value per unit \u2248 28/18 \u2248 1.56) \u2192 3 * 1.56 \u2248 4.68\n  Total given value \u2248 3.85 + 4.68 \u2248 8.53\n\n- **Get:** 3 Ore (value per unit \u2248 32/8 = 4) \u2192 3 * 4 = 12\n  2 Wheat (value per unit \u2248 6/11 \u2248 0.55) \u2192 2 * 0.55 \u2248 1.1\n  Total received value \u2248 12 + 1.1 \u2248 13.1\n\n**Net Gain:** 13.1 - 8.53 \u2248 +4.57\n\nThis seems beneficial. However, the opponent might not accept this as it's heavily in my favor. Maybe adjust to be more balanced.\n\n**Revised Offer:**\n- Give: 4 Sheep, 2 Brick\n- Get: 2 Ore, 1 Wheat\n\n**Calculating:**\n- Give: 4 * 0.77 + 2 * 1.56 \u2248 3.08 + 3.12 \u2248 6.2\n- Get: 2 * 4 + 1 * 0.55 \u2248 8 + 0.55 \u2248 8.55\n- Net Gain: \u2248 +2.35\n\nStill positive, more reasonable.\n\n**Final Offer for Turn 1:**\n[Offer: 4 Sheep, 2 Brick -> 2 Ore, 1 Wheat]",

Since accepting the offer doesn't change the total value, we could consider making a new offer that might be more beneficial.\n\n## Step 8: Formulate a new offer or decide on the current offer.\nLet's analyze the current resources and think about a potential trade. We have a lot of Sheep and Ore is relatively valuable. A possible trade could involve offering Sheep for Ore.\n\n## Step 9: Execute the decision.\nGiven the current offer doesn't change our total value, and we are on the 9th turn, let's consider making a new offer.
