      "response": "After reviewing our trading history and current resource valuation, I propose the following trade to optimize my holdings based on mutual benefit. Given your previous acceptance of Wood and Wheat transactions, I believe this offer aligns with our interests:\n\n[Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 2 Brick]  \n\n**Rationale:**  \n- I offer accessible resources (Wood/Wheat valued lower for me) in exchange for Brick, which holds higher utility in my portfolio.  \n- The proposed exchange increases my total value while providing you with versatile resources you've historically engaged with.  \n\nThis closes the negotiation efficiently on the final turn.",
