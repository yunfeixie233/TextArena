      "response": "After careful consideration of our resources and previous negotiations, I recognize that Ore remains a high-value target for us due to its value of 35 per unit, but previous offers for Ore were rejected. To adapt, I propose a different approach: I offer a combination of Sheep and Wood in exchange for Brick, which we also value highly (30 per unit). This trade ensures a net gain in total value for us while providing you with resources you may need.  \n\n**Offer**:  \n[Offer: 7 Sheep, 6 Wood -> 5 Brick]  \n\n**Reasoning**:  \n- We give: 7 Sheep (14 \u00d7 7 = 98 value) + 6 Wood (8 \u00d7 6 = 48 value) \u2192 Total offered value = 146  \n- We request: 5 Brick (30 \u00d7 5 = 150 value)  \n- **Net gain for us**: 150 - 146 = +4 value  \n- This trade helps us consolidate our resource value efficiently and unload surplus Sheep, while offering you flexibility.  \n\nWe believe this is a balanced opportunity. Let us know your thoughts!",
