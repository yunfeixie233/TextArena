      "response": "In the Negotiation Game, it's crucial to adjust trade offers based on the responses from the opponent. Since Player 1 has been consistently rejecting offers, I will reassess the current resources I have and consider offering trades that might appeal to them more based on their possible unspoken preferences.\n\nCurrent resources after successful trades:\n- Wheat: 16 (Value: 5 each)\n- Wood: 9 (Value: 12 each)\n- Sheep: 4 (after giving away 2 Sheep) (Value: 12 each)\n- Brick: 7 (after receiving 2 Brick) (Value: 20 each)\n- Ore: 19 (after giving away 4 Ore) (Value: 39 each)\n\nI'll analyze the ratios of resources and values to find a potential trade that could work. Player 1 might need Wood or Brick.\n\nLet's make a new offer based on the current resources and what might be valuable for the opponent.\n\n### New Trade Offer\n- **Offered items:** 4 Brick (Value: 20 each)\n- **Requested items:** 6 Wood (Value: 12 each)\n\n### Trade Offer Format\n[Offer: 4 Brick -> 6 Wood]\n\nI will propose this to Player 1 and see their response.",
