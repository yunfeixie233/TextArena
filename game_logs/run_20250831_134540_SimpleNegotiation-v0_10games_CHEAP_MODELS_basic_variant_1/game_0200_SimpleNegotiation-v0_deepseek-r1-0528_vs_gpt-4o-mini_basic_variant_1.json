This trade reduces my total value, so I must decline.\n\nInstead, I'll propose a new trade that benefits me while offering Player 1 resources they may need. I currently have ample Brick (18 units valued at 21 each), and Ore remains critical to my strategy (13 units, 35 each). I propose trading 4 Brick (worth 84 to me) for 3 Ore (worth 105 to me), a net gain of 21. This aligns with my goal to maximize value.\n\n**Action:**\n[Deny]\n[Offer: 4 Brick -> 3 Ore]",
