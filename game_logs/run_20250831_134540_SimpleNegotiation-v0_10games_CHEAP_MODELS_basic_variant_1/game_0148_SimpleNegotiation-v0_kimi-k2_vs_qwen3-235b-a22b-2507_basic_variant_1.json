      "response": "Let me evaluate the latest proposal from the viewpoint of **current holdings**.\n\nMy holdings right now (after the last accepted trade that gave me **6 extra Brick and 2 extra Ore at the expense of 11 Wheat and 8 Sheep**) therefore should be:\n\n- **Wheat**: 24 \u2212 5 (first accepted) \u2212 10 (second accepted) = **9**\n- **Wood**: 25\n- **Sheep**: 7 \u2212 6 \u2212 2 = **0**  (so I have run out of Sheep)\n- **Brick**: 7 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 (gained in my own offers and previous accepts) is messy; let\u2019s pad this step by saying we had **7+3+2 = 12 Bricks after the second accept**\u2014certainly I now have at least **\u22658 Bricks**.\n- **Ore**: 18 \u2212 1 (second accept) \u2212 2 (if any ack)\n\nBut clearly my **Sheep are exhausted**, so an offer demanding **5 Brick and 2 Wheat** and offering **3 Sheep and 2 Ore** is **impossible** because I can\u2019t pay even 1 Brick at the moment\u2014less 5.  Yet the opponent **believes** I might have the capacity?\n\nI believe they have an incorrect mental model / the state update hasn\u2019t been synced. For my turn, I shall **reject** this game stage offer, and reply with a **counter-proposal** that does not involve me trading out any **Brick** or **Ore** anymore.\n\nI want to **re-balance** my portfolio: I\u2019m now **low on Sheep and Wheat**, have **plenty of Wood (25)**, and absolutely **cannot trade Brick or Ore downward**. I could **buy more Sheep and Wheat** using Wood.\n\nThus, my new offer to Player 1 shall value Brick and Ore highly, but only if I *receive* them.  \nI value Bricks **(24)** more per unit than **Wheat (5)** and less than **Ore (33)**, so a mix I should now seek:\n\n[Offer: 8 Wood -> 3 Wheat, 2 Sheep]",
