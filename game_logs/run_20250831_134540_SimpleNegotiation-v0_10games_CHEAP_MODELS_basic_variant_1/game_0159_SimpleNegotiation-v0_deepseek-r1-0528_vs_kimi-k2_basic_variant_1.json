Ideal to trade away.\n- **Wood**: Moderately low value (9) and moderate quantity (16). Can be used as a filler.\n- **Sheep**: Moderate value (15) but high quantity (24). Reducing excess sheep for higher-value resources is strategic.\n- **Brick**: High value (25) and moderate quantity (16). Target for acquisition as it has a strong value density.\n- **Ore**: Highest value (34) but valuable to hold, so trading away should be minimized unless a significant gain is possible.\n\nI'll prioritize exchanging sheep (which I have in surplus) for brick (higher value). Specifically:\n- Offering **6 Sheep** (which costs me 6 \u00d7 15 = 90 in subjective value).\n- Requesting **5 Brick** (which gives me 5 \u00d7 25 = 125 in subjective value).\n- **Net gain**: 125 - 90 = +35 in value.\n\nThis trade leverages my sheep abundance while acquiring brick to boost my total portfolio efficiently.

      "response": "I see you've offered 4 Brick and 2 Sheep in exchange for 2 Ore. Let me quickly evaluate this.\n\nAfter our previous trades, I currently value my Ore highly (each unit at 34), while Brick (25) and Sheep (15) have lower individual values. But the math works out favorably\u2014this trade nets me a solid gain. Giving up 2 Ore costs me 68 in value, while gaining 4 Brick (100) and 2 Sheep (30) adds 130, for a net increase of 62. That aligns with my goal of growing my total value, so I'm on board with this exchange.\n\n[Accept]",
