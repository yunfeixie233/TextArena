      "response": "Given the history of rejected offers, I need to adjust my strategy to find a trade that benefits me while potentially appealing to Player 0. My previous offers focused on trading lower-value resources (Wheat and Wood) or a moderate amount of Sheep for higher-value resources (Brick or Ore), but they were consistently rejected. So far, trading seems one-sided in terms of my valuations, and Player 0 may value these resources differently or have different strategic priorities.\n\nTo increase my total resource value, I should prioritize:\n- Acquiring more Ore (value 33 per unit) or Brick (value 30 per unit), as they are my highest-value resources.\n- Offloading resources with lower values per unit to me, such as Wheat (6), Wood (8), or Sheep (18).\n\nHowever, Wheat and Wood trades have failed repeatedly, so I'll shift to using Sheep, which I have in abundance (25 units). This avoids what Player 0 appears to disfavor.\n\nMy new offer:\n- **Offer**: 7 Sheep for 4 Ore.\n  - **Value from my perspective**: 7 \u00d7 18 = 126 given, 4 \u00d7 33 = 132 received \u2192 **net gain of 6**.\n  - **Why this might appeal to Player 0?**: If Player 0 values Sheep more highly than I do, this trade could be mutually beneficial. Even if their valuations align somewhat with mine, the net loss for Player 0 is smaller (only -6 based on my values) compared to my previous Sheep offer (6 Sheep for 4 Ore had a net loss of -24 for them). Smaller quantity trades (7 Sheep vs. 6 Sheep) may also seem less risky.\n\nIf accepted, my resources and value would improve (Sheep decreases to 18, Ore increases to 22; total value up by 6). This brings me closer to my goal of increasing total value while showing flexibility to entice Player 0.\n\n[Offer: 7 Sheep -> 4 Ore]",
