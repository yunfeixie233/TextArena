      "response": "I'm extracting the essential information from the History so far:\n\nTurn history  \n- Turn 1: P0 offered [5 Sheep + 3 Ore \u2192 5 Brick + 2 Wheat].  I evaluated that as **bad for me**, so I returned a **[Deny]**.  \n- Turns 2-3: Both sides had empty offers and both were rejected.  \n- Turn 4: I tried [5 Brick \u2192 3 Sheep + 1 Ore] and **it was accepted**.  \n  \u2013 Result: \u20135 Brick (value \u2013105), +3 Sheep (value +45), +1 Ore (value +36).  \n  \u2013 Net change: \u201324 value, but **my Brick haul is now 20 instead of 25**, while Sheep became 10 and Ore became 10.  \n  I judged that acceptable because Brick is plentiful (20 remaining) and I value consolidation into high-value resources (Ore & Sheep).  \n\nCurrent inventory (after Turn 4)  \n- Wheat 19  (value 5)  \n- Wood 24  (value 9)  \n- Sheep 10 (value 15)  \n- Brick 20 (value 21)  \n- Ore   10 (value 36)  \n\nCurrent turn is Turn 5.  No new offer has been made yet by the opponent.\n\nI still have 20 Brick (the best I can afford to give up) and I\u2019m currently low on Ore (only 10), which has the highest unit value.  \nI\u2019d like to turn some Brick into Ore while also picking up more Sheep/Wheat at good rates.  In the previous turn, offering 5 Brick for 3 Sheep was borderline (-24) but acceptable because consolidation mattered.  Now that I have a tiny bit less Brick and one extra Ore, the similar ratio still looks worthwhile, but I don\u2019t want to keep the exact same deal that just got rejected.  So I\u2019ll tighten the request slightly to make it clearly positive in value for me.\n\nMy plan for this turn: offer **5 Brick for 2 Sheep + 1 Ore**.  \nValue calculation:  \n\u20135 Brick (\u2013105) vs +2 Sheep (+30) +1 Ore (+36) = \u2013105 + 66 = \u201339 expected.  \nThat is **strictly worse for me than last time**, so the proposal just described is actually **detrimental**. Let me think again.\n\nLooking again \u2013 trading 4 Brick into 1 Ore (ratio 84 \u2192 36) alone is still very expensive. I must request **at least two Ore** to make the offer net-positive. \n\nA workable, slightly but convincingly** positive proposal is 5 Brick \u2192 2 Ore + 2 Sheep.  \nCheck: \u20135 Brick (\u2013105) vs +2 Ore (72) +2 Sheep (30) = \u2013105 + 102 = \u20133; that\u2019s still negative!  \nRe-checking math: 5\u00d721 = 105 vs 2\u00d736 + 2\u00d715 = 72+30=102, yes. So the bare minimum that breaks even is 2 Ore + 2 Sheep plus **something else** of value 3.  The smallest extra object permissible is 1 Wheat (value 5), but then I\u2019d overpay.  A more compact offer is therefore **5 Brick \u2192 2 Ore + 2 Sheep + 1 Wheat**.  That sums to 102+5=107 vs 105 = **+2 net value**, the smallest credible increment.\n\nBut proposals must stay simple in this interface.  \nRealistically I need **five Brick for three Ore**, because 3\u00d736=108 vs 5\u00d721=105 gives the tiniest positive margin.\n\nSo my optimal simple offer is:\n\n[Offer: 5 Brick -> 3 Ore]",
