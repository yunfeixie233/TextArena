      "response": "To start, I will analyze the resources and their values that I currently possess. The resources and their values are:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 24   Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 16   Value: 12\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 23   Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 21   Value: 23\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 7    Value: 36\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of the resources I currently have:\n- Wheat: 24 * 6 = 144\n- Wood: 16 * 12 = 192\n- Sheep: 23 * 17 = 391\n- Brick: 21 * 23 = 483\n- Ore: 7 * 36 = 252\n\nTotal value = 144 + 192 + 391 + 483 + 252 = 1462\n\nTo maximize my gain, I should aim to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value. Given the current distribution, Ore has the highest value per unit, followed by Brick, Sheep, Wood, and then Wheat.\n\nSince Ore is highly valued and I have a relatively low quantity of it, I should be cautious about trading it away. I will start by examining potential trades that either gain me more Ore or maintain my current Ore quantity while improving the overall value.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of my less valuable resources for more Ore or resources with a higher value. Let's consider offering some Wheat (the lowest value resource) for Ore.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate the maximum quantity of Wheat I can offer for Ore.\nTo get more Ore, I can offer Wheat. I have 24 Wheat, and I need to determine how much Ore I can get in return.\n\n## Step 2: Formulate a trade offer.\nLet's start with an offer: '[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Ore]'. This is a reasonable starting point because it offers a relatively small amount of Wheat for a significant resource like Ore.\n\n## Step 3: Check if the offer is worth making.\nThe value of 8 Wheat is 8 * 6 = 48. The value of 1 Ore is 1 * 36 = 36. This trade is not favorable as it stands because I'm giving up more value than I'm getting (48 > 36). I need to adjust the offer.\n\n## Step 4: Adjust the trade offer.\nLet's adjust the offer to be more favorable: '[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]'. Here, I'm offering 4 Wheat (4*6 = 24) and 1 Wood (1*12 = 12), totaling 36 in value for 1 Ore (36 in value). This trade is more balanced in terms of value.\n\n## Step 5: Make the initial trade offer.\nI will make the trade offer: '[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]'.\n\nThus, my action for Turn 1 is: [Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Ore]",

(Implicitly, the previous rejection or lack of offer continued.)\n   - Turn 4: Player 1 offered 1 Ore for 8 Wheat. Player 0 rejected.\n   - Turn 5: Player 0 offered 7 Wheat for 1 Ore. Player 1 accepted.\n     - **After Trade:** Wheat: 17, Ore: 8\n   - Turn 6: Player 1 made no new offer.\n   - Turn 7: Player 0 offered 6 Wheat for 1 Brick. Player 1 accepted.\n     - **After Trade:** Wheat: 11, Brick: 22\n\n3. **Current Resources and Values After Last Trade:**\n   - Wheat: 11 units, Value: 6. Total Value = 11 * 6 = 66\n   - Wood: 16 units, Value: 12. Total Value = 16 * 12 = 192\n   - Sheep: 23 units, Value: 17. Total Value = 23 * 17 = 391\n   - Brick: 22 units, Value: 23. Total Value = 22 * 23 = 506\n   - Ore: 8 units, Value: 36. Total Value = 8 * 36 = 288\n\n4. **Total Value of Resources:**\n   - Initial Total Value = (24*6) + (16*12) + (23*17) + (21*23) + (7*36) = 144 + 192 + 391 + 483 + 252 = 1462\n   - Current Total Value = 66 + 192 + 391 + 506 + 288 = 1443\n\n### Decision for Next Turn:\nGiven that the total value of resources has slightly decreased from 1462 to 1443, we need to make a strategic trade to increase the total value.\n\n1. **Analysis of Current Holdings:**\n   - We have a good amount of Sheep and Brick.\n   - We have relatively lower value resources like Wheat and Wood compared to others.\n\n2. **Potential Trades:**\n   - Consider offering Wheat or Wood for higher value resources.\n   - Since Ore is valuable and we already have 8 units, we might not want to acquire more unless the trade is extremely favorable.\n\n3. **Proposed Trade:**\n   - We can offer some Wheat (e.g., 5 Wheat) for a resource that is more valuable. Let's consider offering for Brick or Ore, but since we just acquired Ore and Brick is what we have a lot of, maybe we should look at other resources or negotiate with what we have in surplus.\n   - **Offer:** `[Offer: 5 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep]`. However, we already have a lot of Sheep. Let's rethink.\n   - **Alternative Offer:** Considering our resources, offering Wheat or Wood for Ore could be beneficial. `[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]` could be a potential trade, but we need to check if it's worth it. The value of 4 Wheat is 24, and 1 Ore is 36, so it's a gain.\n\n### Action:\nLet's make a trade offer that could potentially increase our total value. Given that Ore is valuable and we are slightly short on it for a big gain, let's offer some Wheat for Ore.\n\n`[Offer: 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]`\n\nLet's execute this trade and see the opponent's response.",

I offered 7 Wheat -> 1 Ore (value: 7*6 = 42 -> 1*36 = 36, loss of 6)\n   - New quantities: Wheat = 24 - 7 = 17, Ore = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n2. I offered 6 Wheat -> 1 Brick (value: 6*6 = 36 -> 1*23 = 23, loss of 13)\n   - New quantities: Wheat = 17 - 6 = 11, Brick = 21 + 1 = 22\n\n3. I offered 5 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Sheep (value: 5*12 + 3*6 = 60 + 18 = 78 -> 1*17 = 17, loss of 61)\n   - New quantities: Wood = 16 - 5 = 11, Wheat = 11 - 3 = 8, Sheep = 23 + 1 = 24\n\nCurrent quantities and values:\n\t+ [Wheat]   Qty: 8   Value: 6\n\t+ [Wood]    Qty: 11   Value: 12\n\t+ [Sheep]   Qty: 24   Value: 17\n\t+ [Brick]   Qty: 22   Value: 23\n\t+ [Ore]     Qty: 8    Value: 36\n\nLet's examine the last trade: I lost significant value (61) for 1 Sheep. While Sheep is valuable, the trade was unfavorable. I need to re-evaluate and make a more beneficial trade.\n\nTo increase the total value, I should try to get resources with higher values or make trades that are more favorable.\n\nConsidering the current quantities and values, a potential trade could involve offering resources with lower values in exchange for those with higher values.\n\nOne possible trade: Offer 4 Sheep -> 1 Ore (value: 4*17 = 68 -> 1*36 = 36, loss of 32). However, this is still not a great trade.\n\nA better trade: Offer 3 Brick -> 1 Ore (value: 3*23 = 69 -> 1*36 = 36, loss of 33). Again, not ideal.\n\nA more reasonable trade: Offer 2 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick (value: 2*12 + 2*17 = 24 + 34 = 58 -> 3*23 = 69, gain of 11). This trade seems beneficial.\n\nAction: [Offer: 2 Wood, 2 Sheep -> 3 Brick]\n\nThe proposed action is: [Offer: 2 Sheep, 2 Wood -> 3 Brick]",
