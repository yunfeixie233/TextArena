      "response": "Okay, this is Turn 2. I need to make a new offer to Player 1.\nFirst, let's update my resources after the last trade:\nI offered 7 Ore and Player 1 offered 5 Brick.\n\nInitial Resources:\n+ [Wheat]   Qty: 23   Value: 5\n+ [Wood]    Qty: 18   Value: 9\n+ [Sheep]   Qty: 15   Value: 12\n+ [Brick]   Qty: 16   Value: 28\n+ [Ore]     Qty: 7    Value: 34\n\nTrade: Offered 7 Ore -> Requested 5 Brick\n\nUpdated Resources:\n+ [Wheat]   Qty: 23   Value: 5    (Still 23)\n+ [Wood]    Qty: 18   Value: 9    (Still 18)\n+ [Sheep]   Qty: 15   Value: 12   (Still 15)\n+ [Brick]   Qty: 16 + 5 = 21   Value: 28\n+ [Ore]     Qty: 7 - 7 = 0    Value: 34\n\nMy current total value:\n(23 * 5) + (18 * 9) + (15 * 12) + (21 * 28) + (0 * 34)\n= 115 + 162 + 180 + 588 + 0\n= 1045\n\nBefore the trade, my total value was:\n(23 * 5) + (18 * 9) + (15 * 12) + (16 * 28) + (7 * 34)\n= 115 + 162 + 180 + 448 + 238\n= 1143\n\nWait, something is off. I offered 7 Ore (Value: 7 * 34 = 238) and received 5 Brick (Value: 5 * 28 = 140). This trade actually decreased my total value by 98. This was a bad trade! I need to be more careful. Player 1 accepted because it was a good deal for them.\n\nMy goal is to increase the total value of my resources. This means I need to trade low-value resources for high-value resources, or trade resources I have in surplus for more valuable ones.\n\nI currently have 0 Ore. Ore is the most valuable resource at 34. I should aim to acquire it.\nBrick is the next most valuable at 28. I now have 21 Brick.\nSheep is 12, Wood is 9, Wheat is 5.\n\nI have a lot of Wheat (23), Wood (18), and Sheep (15). I should try to trade these for higher-value items. My Brick stock is also somewhat high at 21.\n\nLet's try to get some Ore.\nWhat can I offer for Ore?\nI have plenty of Wood and Wheat.\nValue of 1 Ore = 34.\nValue of 1 Brick = 28.\nValue of 1 Sheep = 12.\nValue of 1 Wood = 9.\nValue of 1 Wheat = 5.\n\nIf I offer multiple lower-value items, I need to make sure their combined value is less than what I'm requesting, but still attractive to the other player.\n\nLet's try to get 1 Ore for something I have a surplus of.\nPerhaps 3 Wood and 1 Wheat? (3*9 + 1*5 = 27 + 5 = 32) This is close to 34 but still less. Player 1 might accept this.\n\nStrategic thinking:\nPlayer 1 accepted my previous offer, which was bad for me but good for them. This suggests Player 1 is willing to make trades that benefit them. I need to make sure my offers benefit me and are still somewhat appealing to Player 1.\nI have a significant amount of Brick now. Maybe I can offer some Brick to get Ore if I need to.\n\nConsidered offer: [Offer: 3 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\nMy value gain: 34 - 32 = 2. Small gain, but positive. It uses up low-value resources.\n\nLet's try a slightly higher volume trade for more impact.\nWhat if I offer a mix of lower-value resources for something significant like 2 Ore (value 68)?\nThis would require a lot of my existing resources.\n\nAlternative: Trade Brick for Ore if Player 1 is short on Brick or values Brick highly.\nI have 21 Brick. If I trade 2 Brick for 1 Ore:\nMy value gain: 34 - (2 * 28) = 34 - 56 = -22. This is bad for me. I should NOT trade 2 Brick for 1 Ore.\n\nWhat about trading Sheep for Ore?\nIf I offer 3Sheep (3*12 = 36) for 1 Ore (34): This loses 2 value for me. Bad.\nIf I offer 2Sheep (2*12 = 24) for 1 Ore (34): My value gain is 10. This is a good trade for me, but is it enticing enough for Player 1?\n\nLet's try to get Ore using my most abundant low-value resources.\nI will propose trading Wheat and Wood for Ore.\n\nOffer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore\nMy current resources:\n+ [Wheat]   Qty: 23   Value: 5\n+ [Wood]    Qty: 18   Value: 9\n+ [Sheep]   Qty: 15   Value: 12\n+ [Brick]   Qty: 21   Value: 28\n+ [Ore]     Qty: 0    Value: 34\n\nValue of 4 Wood + 2 Wheat = (4 * 9) + (2 * 5) = 36 + 10 = 46.\nValue of 1 Ore = 34.\nThis would be a loss of 12 value for me. This is not a good offer for me.\n\nI need to offer less value than I receive.\n\nLet's rethink:\nI want to increase my value.\nI need to *receive* higher value items than I *offer*.\n\nResources sorted by value (high to low):\nOre (34)\nBrick (28)\nSheep (12)\nWood (9)\nWheat (5)\n\nI have: Wheat (23), Wood (18), Sheep (15), Brick (21), Ore (0).\n\nMy priority is to get Ore.\nWhat if I trade 2 Sheep (2 * 12 = 24) for 1 Ore (34)?\nMy value gain: 34 - 24 = 10.\nThis is a very good gain for me. Will Player 1 accept it? Player 1 would lose 10 value. Probably not.\n\nMaybe I can offer a combination that seems more attractive to Player 1, even if it's still a net gain for me?\nLet's try to get 1 Ore.\nWhat if I offer 1 Brick (value 28) for 1 Ore (value 34)?\nMy value gain = 34 - 28 = 6. This is a small but positive gain for me.\nPlayer 1 would give up 1 Ore and get 1 Brick, losing 6 value. They might be reluctant.\nHowever, I have 21 Brick, which is a lot. Maybe Player 1 needs Brick more than I need Ore. It's a possibility.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Player 1's likely strategy based on the last turn.\nPlayer 1 *accepted* my previous offer of \"7 Ore -> 5 Brick\".\nThey got 7 Ore (value 238) and gave 5 Brick (value 140). Player 1's gain was 238 - 140 = 98 value.\nThis tells me Player 1 is willing to make trades that are *very* beneficial to them.\n\nI need to be more strategic and not make offers that dramatically benefit Player 1 at my expense.\nMy goal is to increase *my* total value.\n\nLet's aim for a trade that gives me a small positive value gain, but is still reasonable for the other player.\nI have a significant amount of Wheat (23). It's the lowest value. Let's try to get rid of some for higher-value items.\n\nOffer: 5 Wheat -> 1 Wood\nValue of 5 Wheat = 5 * 5 = 25.\nValue of 1 Wood = 9.\nThis is a loss for me (9 - 25 = -16). No.\n\nLet's target getting Some Ore or some Brick.\nI have a lot of Wheat and Wood.\nWhat if I offer a lot of Wheat and Wood for some Sheep?\n3 Wood + 3 Wheat -> 2 Sheep\nValue of (3*9) + (3*5) = 27 + 15 = 42.\nValue of 2 Sheep = 2 * 12 = 24.\nAgain, this is a loss for me.\n\nI need to focus on what I want to acquire (higher value) and what I am willing to give up (lower value).\nTarget: 1 Ore (Value 34)\nWhat to offer: lower value items.\n\nOption 1: Offer 3 Sheep for 1 Ore.\nValue of 3 Sheep = 3 * 12 = 36.\nValue of 1 Ore = 34.\nMy loss: 2. Not good.\n\nOption 2: Offer 2 Sheep for 1 Ore.\nValue of 2 Sheep = 2 * 12 = 24.\nValue of 1 Ore = 34.\nMy gain: 10. Good.\nPlayer 1's current resources are unknown, but if they have 1 Ore and want 2 Sheep, they would lose 10 value. They might deny this.\n\nWhat if I aim for Brick instead of Ore, given my low Ore count?\nTarget: 1 Brick (Value 28)\nOffer: 3 Wood (Value 27)? This would earn me 1 value.\nOffer: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat? (2*9 + 2*5 = 18+10 = 28). This is an even swap. No value gain.\nOffer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat? (2*9 + 1*5 = 18+5 = 23). This yields a gain of 5. This is good for me.\nPlayer 1 would give 1 Brick (28) and get 2 Wood (18) + 1 Wheat (5) = 23. Player 1 loses 5 value. This is a possibility.\n\nLet's review the current state again:\nTurn 2. I have 9 turns left. No rush.\nMy total value decreased last turn. I need to reverse this.\n\nI have 23 Wheat (lowest value) and 18 Wood (second lowest). These are good to get rid of.\nI have 15 Sheep and 21 Brick (quite a lot of Brick now). I have 0 Ore. Getting Ore is high priority but challenging.\n\nLet's make a reasonable offer that gives me a small positive gain.\nHow about trading some Wheat and Wood for Sheep?\nTarget: 2 Sheep (Value 24)\nOffer: X Wheat, Y Wood such that X*5 + Y*9 is slightly less than 24.\nE.g., 2 Wood, 1 Wheat? (2*9 + 1*5 = 18 + 5 = 23). Getting 2 Sheep (24) for 2 Wood + 1 Wheat (23) yields a gain of 1.\nThis is a small gain, but it moves me out of lowest value items into a mid-value item.\nThe value loss for Player 1 is 1. This would be a fairly balanced trade. Player 1 might accept it.\n\nLet's try this. It's a small step, but it's a positive gain and uses up some of my lowest value resources.\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]",
