      "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first calculate the total value of the resources I currently have.\n\n1. Wheat: 21 * 5 = 105\n2. Wood: 19 * 10 = 190\n3. Sheep: 6 * 16 = 96\n4. Brick: 6 * 21 = 126\n5. Ore: 25 * 34 = 850\n\nTotal value = 105 + 190 + 96 + 126 + 850 = 1367\n\nTo maximize the total value of my resources, I should look for opportunities to trade resources of lower value for those of higher value or equal value but in a more beneficial quantity.\n\nLet's examine my resources and their values:\n- The highest value resource I have is Ore (Value: 34).\n- The lowest value resource I have is Wheat (Value: 5).\n\nMy first action will be to make an offer that potentially gains me more value. I can start by looking at resources that are relatively valuable to me and see if I can trade something less valuable for them.\n\nOne potential trade could involve offering some of my lower-value resources (or less valuable resources relative to their quantity) for resources that are more valuable or for more quantity.\n\nLet's consider offering some Wheat (the lowest value resource) or Wood (the next lowest value resource) for something more valuable.\n\n## Step 1: Identify potential resources to trade away\nI can trade away Wheat (Value: 5) or Wood (Value: 10) for more valuable resources.\n\n## Step 2: Formulate a trade offer\nLet's offer 10 Wheat (total value = 50) for 1 Brick (Value: 21), which doesn't seem like a good trade since I'm giving up more value than I'm getting. However, let's consider a more balanced trade.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the value of resources and propose a trade\nIf I offer 5 Wood (Value: 10 * 5 = 50) for 2 Brick (Value: 21 * 2 = 42), it's still not beneficial. However, if I can get a good deal, it might be worth it. Let's think about what I can offer and request.\n\n## Step 4: Make a reasonable trade offer\nLet's offer something that could be considered reasonable. If I offer 4 Wood (Value: 40) and 2 Wheat (Value: 10), totaling 50, for 2 Brick (Value: 42), it might be somewhat acceptable, but I'm still giving up more value. \n\nHowever, a more straightforward approach is to directly examine what I can trade for Ore or other high-value resources. Since I already have a lot of Ore, let's see if I can offer Ore for something else valuable.\n\n## Step 5: Propose a trade\nLet's offer 2 Ore (Value: 34 * 2 = 68) for something of higher or comparable value. If I can get 2 Brick (Value: 42), it would be a loss. But if I can get something more valuable or a significant quantity, it might be worth it.\n\n## Step 6: Finalize a trade offer\nConsidering my resources, let's directly make an offer. I'll offer '[Offer: 10 Wheat, 2 Wood -> 1 Ore]' to see if the opponent is willing to make a trade that could potentially benefit me. However, this seems not directly beneficial as I'm giving away (10*5 + 2*10 = 50 + 20 = 70) for 34.\n\nLet's adjust my strategy to make it more beneficial.\n\n## Step 7: Adjust the trade offer\nLet's think about trading some of my less valuable resources for more Sheep or Brick since they are relatively valuable.\n\n'[Offer: 5 Wood, 5 Wheat -> 2 Sheep]' could be a potential trade. Here, I'm offering (5*10 + 5*5 = 50 + 25 = 75) for (2*16 = 32), which is not beneficial.\n\nLet's reconsider and make a more sensible offer.\n\n'[Offer: 3 Ore -> 2 Brick, 1 Sheep]' could be a potential trade. Here, I'm offering (3*34 = 102) for (2*21 + 1*16 = 42 + 16 = 58), which is not beneficial for me.\n\n## Step 8: Make a sensible trade\nLet's directly propose a trade that could be beneficial or at least a starting point.\n\n'[Offer: 4 Wheat, 1 Wood -> 1 Sheep]' could be considered. Here, I'm giving (4*5 + 1*10 = 20 + 10 = 30) for (1*16 = 16), which is still not beneficial.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluate resources and propose a trade\nLet's offer something that might be more acceptable: '[Offer: 2 Ore -> 3 Brick]'.\n\nHere, I'm giving (2*34 = 68) for (3*21 = 63), which is still slightly not in my favor.\n\n## Step 10: Final trade decision for Turn 1\nLet's make a trade that seems somewhat reasonable: '[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'.\n\nI'm giving away (8*5 = 40) for (1*21 = 21), which is still not a great trade for me but let's start the negotiation.\n\n'[Offer: 8 Wheat -> 1 Brick]'.",

While this isn't a great trade for me value-wise, it's worth considering if Player 1 is desperate for Ore or Brick and has Sheep and Wood to spare.\n\nHowever, a more conservative and potentially more valuable trade for me could be:\n'[Offer: 1 Ore -> 1 Sheep]' or '[Offer: 2 Wood, 1 Brick -> 3 Sheep]' if I assume they have Sheep.\n\nLet's go with a simple one:\n'[Offer: 2 Ore -> 1 Sheep]' \n\nThis is a trade worth considering because it gives away 2*34 = 68 worth of Ore for 1*16 = 16 worth of Sheep.

We rejected this offer.\n\nConsidering the current state and the goal to increase the total value of resources:\n\n1. **Evaluate the last rejected offer**: Giving 10 Wheat for 1 Ore. Currently, I have 6 Wheat, so I cannot fulfill this request even if I wanted to.\n   \n2. **Consider making a new offer**: Looking at the values, Ore is the most valuable resource. I have enough Wheat and Wood to potentially trade for more Ore or other valuable resources.\n\n3. **Potential Trade**:\n   - I have 6 Wheat, which is relatively low in value. Trading some of it for a more valuable resource could be beneficial.\n   - One potential trade could involve offering Wheat and/or Wood for Ore or Brick.\n\nLet's propose a trade that could be beneficial: \n- I have 6 Wheat, and offering some of it along with other less valuable resources for Ore could be a good strategy.\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nConsidering the current quantities and the need to increase the total value, I'll make a new offer. Since I have a good amount of Wood and some Wheat, I can try to trade them for Ore.\n\n[Offer: 4 Wood, 2 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer is reasonable because I'm giving away resources of total value 4*10 + 2*5 = 50 for 1 Ore of value 34. However, I need to be cautious and consider what my opponent might accept. Let's adjust the offer to be more appealing.\n\nLet's make the offer: \n[Offer: 3 Wood, 3 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nThis offer gives away resources worth 3*10 + 3*5 = 45 for 1 Ore worth 34, still not ideal, but let's try to negotiate with a slightly different offer that might be more acceptable.\n\n### Action\n\n[Offer: 2 Wood, 4 Wheat -> 1 Ore]\n\nLet's see how Player 1 responds to this. \n\n### Response to be determined after Player 1's action.",
