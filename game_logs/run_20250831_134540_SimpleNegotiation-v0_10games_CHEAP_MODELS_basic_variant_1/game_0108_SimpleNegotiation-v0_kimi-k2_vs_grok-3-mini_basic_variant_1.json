I'm relatively rich in Sheep (25 units) and have good quantities of Brick\n2. I could use more Wood (only 10 units) as it's quite valuable and I have little\n3. Ore is my most valuable resource, so I should be careful about trading too much of it\n4. Wheat has the lowest individual value, so I should try to trade away wheat for other resources\n\nSince I have high quantities of Sheep and Wheat, I should look to trade these for more valuable resources like Wood or possibly more Ore/Brick.\n\nLet me start by making an opening offer to test Player 1's preferences.\n\n**Turn 1: Opening position**\nHi Player 1! I've got plenty of sheep and wheat, and could use some more wood or brick. Would you be interested in trading 4 wheat and 3 sheep for some brick or wood? What would you find fair?",
