            "1. **Movement Rules:**\n"
            "   - On your turn, you can move one piece by one step to an adjacent square (up, down, left, or right) that is already occupied with your pieces.\n"
            "   - Example: A piece can move from A1 to B1 or A1 to A2 if B1 and A2 are not placed with the player's own pieces.\n"
            "   - If the selected piece is a Bomb or a Flag, it cannot be moved.\n"
            # "   - **Scout Movement:** Scouts, on the other hand, can move multiple steps in a straight line (horizontally or vertically), but strictly only on one condition.\n"
            # "       - The condition is that Scouts cannot jump over any piece (your own or your opponent's).\n"

            # "       - This will be indicated as an invalid move which makes you lose the game.\n"
            "2. **Battles:**\n"
            "   - If you move onto a square occupied by an opponent's piece, then a battle will occur:\n"
            "     - The piece with the higher rank wins and eliminates the opponent's piece.\n"
            "     - If the ranks are equal, both pieces are removed from the board.\n"

            "       - Bombs eliminate most attacking pieces except Miners, which defuse Bombs.\n"
            "       - Spies can defeat the Marshal if the Spy attacks first but lose to all other pieces.\n"
            "3. **Strategic Goals:**\n"
            "   - Identify your opponent's pieces through their movements and battles.\n"
            "   - Protect your Flag while attempting to capture your opponent's Flag.\n"
