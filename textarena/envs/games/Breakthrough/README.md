# Breakthrough Environment Documentation

## Overview
**Breakthrough** is a two-player abstract strategy game played on an 8×8 board. Each player starts with two rows of pawns, with White occupying rows 0 and 1 and Black occupying rows 6 and 7. The objective is to either move one of your pawns to the opponent's home row or capture all of your opponent's pawns.

This environment supports all core game mechanics, including pawn movement, captures, and victory conditions. It is designed for reinforcement learning experiments, strategy testing, and AI agent training.

## Action Space
- **Format:** Actions are specified using a chess-like UCI format in brackets: `[start end]`, where `start` and `end` are the starting and ending positions of a pawn.
- **Examples:**
  - `[a2a3]`: Moves the pawn from square `a2` to `a3` (straight forward).
  - `[c2b3]`: Moves the pawn diagonally forward from `c2` to `b3` to capture an opponent's piece.

### Rules for Moves
1. A pawn can move **straight forward** into an empty square.
2. A pawn can move **diagonally forward** only if capturing an opponent's piece.
3. Moving backward or sideways is not allowed.

## Victory Conditions

A player wins if:

2. **Elimination Victory:** They capture all the opponent’s pawns.

Draws are impossible since pawns cannot move backward, and the game always progresses forward.
