<details><summary><strong>Breakthrough [2 Player]</strong></summary><a id="breakthrough"></a>

## `Breakthrough` 
**Breakthrough** is a two-player abstract strategy game played on an n×n board. Each player starts with two rows of pawns, with White occupying rows 0 and 1 and Black occupying rows 6 and 7. The objective is to either move one of your pawns to the opponent's home row or capture all of your opponent's pawns. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_(board_game))

**Action Space:** Actions are specified using a chess-like UCI format in brackets: `[start end]`, where `start` and `end` are the starting and ending positions of a pawn. For example, `[a2a3]` moves the pawn from square `a2` to `a3` (straight forward); `[c2b3]` moves the pawn diagonally forward from `c2` to `b3` to capture an opponent's piece.


| **Reward Setting**               | **Player Role**  | **Reward** |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Reached opponent's home row | Winner           | `+1`       |
|                             | Loser            | `-1`       |
| Captured all opponent pawns | Winner           | `+1`       |
|                             | Loser            | `-1`       |
| Made an invalid move        | Offending Player | `-1`       |

**Env-ids**: The environment supports several variants defined by two parameters: `board_size`, which sets the dimensions of the play board (e.g., 6×6, 8×8, etc.), and `is_open`, a flag indicating whether the full board is visible (True) or hidden (False, showing only past moves).

## `Chess` 

**Chess** is a classic two-player strategy game contested on an 8 × 8 board. Each side commands sixteen pieces (King, Queen, Rooks, Bishops, Knights, and Pawns) and aims to **checkmate** the opponent’s King. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)  

**Action Space:** Moves are written in Universal Chess Interface (UCI) format inside brackets: `[start end]`. For example, `[e2e4]` advances a pawn from *e2* to *e4*; `[g1f3]` moves the knight from *g1* to *f3*. Only the **first** bracketed move in any message is executed.

| **Reward Setting** | **Player Role** | **Reward** |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ---------- |
| Checkmated enemy   | Winner          | `+1`       |
|                    | Loser           | `-1`       |
| Stalemate / draw   | Both            | `0`        |
| Made an invalid move| Offending Player| `-1`       |

**Env-ids**: The environment supports several variants defined by two parameters: `is_open`, which determines whether the full board is shown after each move, and `max_turns`, the turn limit before an automatic draw; `show_valid` indicates whether the valid actions are shown to the model.
| **Env-ID**          | **is_open** | **max_turns** | **show_valid** |

## `Checkers` 
**Checkers** (or **Draughts**) is a two-player strategy game played on an 8 × 8 board. Each side starts with 12 pieces; the goal is to **capture** or **block** all opponent pieces. Pieces move diagonally forward; reaching the far rank “kings” the piece, allowing backward moves as well. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts)

**Action Space:** Specify moves in 0-indexed row/column coordinates inside brackets: `[r1 c1 r2 c2]`. For example, `[2 1 3 2]` moves a piece from (2,1) to (3,2).

| **Reward Setting**          | **Player Role**  | **Reward** |
|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------:|
| Captured / blocked opponent | Winner           | `+1`       |

| Made an invalid move        | Offending player | `-1`       |

**Env-ids:** Only one canonical variant is exposed; you may change `max_turns` when registering custom IDs.

</details><details><summary><strong>Chopsticks [2 Player]</strong></summary><a id="chopsticks"></a>

## `Chopsticks` 
**Chopsticks** is a fast-paced finger-counting duel in which each player manages two “hands.” On your turn you may **attack** with one hand to add its fingers to an opponent hand (wrapping to 0 at 5), or **split** to redistribute your own fingers.  
The first player to leave both opponent hands at 0 wins. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopsticks_(hand_game))  

**Action Space:** Use one of the bracketed commands below (0-indexed hand indices).  
* Attack – `[attack M O]` adds your hand **M** to opponent hand **O**.  
* Split  – `[split L R]` redistributes your fingers so **L + R** equals your current total. 

| **Reward Setting**            | **Player Role** | **Reward** |

## `ConnectFour` 
**Connect Four** is a two-player connection game played on a vertical grid. Players drop discs into columns, and each disc falls to the lowest available cell. The first player to align **four discs in a row**—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally—wins. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)  

**Action Space:** Actions are written as `[col x]`, where `x` is a valid column index (0 … `num_cols − 1`). Example: `[col 3]` (or just '[3]') drops a disc into column 3. Only the **first** bracketed token in a message is parsed.

## `GameOfPureStrategy` 
**Game of Pure Strategy** - also called **GOPS** or *One-Card War* - is a simultaneous-bidding card duel played with the 13 cards **A–K**. Each round reveals a prize card; both players secretly bid one of their remaining cards. Higher bid wins the prize **plus** any carry-over pot from tied rounds. After all 13 prizes the higher total score wins. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Pure_Strategy)

**Action Space:** On your turn send a message containing **exactly one** bracketed card token such as `[Q]`, `[10]`, `[2]`, `[A]`, `[K]`. Only the **first** bracketed token in the message is processed, and each card may only be used once.

**Kuhn Poker** is a minimalist two-player poker variant played with the three-card deck **J Q K**. Each player antes one chip, receives a single hidden card, then takes turns **betting, checking, calling, or folding** in a single betting round. The higher card at showdown - or the last player still in - wins the pot. Despite its simplicity, Kuhn Poker is a textbook example of a zero-sum imperfect-information game with a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhn_poker)

**Action Space:** Send exactly one bracketed token per turn: `[Check]`, `[Bet]`, `[Call]`, or `[Fold]`.

**Pig Dice** is a press-your-luck dice race: on each turn you may **roll** a six-sided die to build a turn subtotal or **hold** to bank it - roll a **1** and you lose everything for that turn. First player to reach the target score wins. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game))

**Action Space:** Submit exactly one bracketed command per turn: `[roll]` or `[hold]`.

</details><details><summary><strong>IteratedTwoThirdsAverage [2 Player]</strong></summary><a id="iteratedtwothirdsaverage"></a>

## `IteratedTwoThirdsAverage` 
**Iterated Two-Thirds of the Average** is a multi-round game where both players simultaneously submit numeric guesses in each round. The target value is calculated as **two-thirds of the average** of the two guesses. The player whose guess is closest to the target wins the round. After a fixed number of rounds (default: 5), the player with the most round-wins wins the overall game.

**Action Space:**  Submit one floating-point number inside square brackets, e.g. `[42.0]`  

**Round Resolution Example:** If Player 0 guesses `20` and Player 1 guesses `80`, the target is `2/3 × (20 + 80)/2 = 66.67`. Player 1 wins the round since `|80 - 66.67| < |20 - 66.67|`.

## `IteratedMatchingPennies`
**Iterated Matching Pennies** is a multi-round zero-sum game between two players. Player 0 plays the **Matcher** role: they win if both players pick the same value. Player 1 plays the **Mismatcher** role: they win if the values differ. Each round, both players simultaneously choose either `[heads]` or `[tails]`. Shorthand `[h]` and `[t]` are also accepted. The player whose role aligns with the outcome wins that round. After a fixed number of rounds (default: 5), the player with the most wins is declared the overall winner.

**Action Space:**  Submit `[heads]`/`[h]`, `[tails]`/`[t]`.  

**Round Resolution Example:**  If Player 0 chooses `[heads]` and Player 1 chooses `[heads]`, Player 0 wins the round. If Player 0 chooses `[tails]` and Player 1 chooses `[heads]`, Player 1 wins the round.

## `TruthAndDeception` 
**TruthAndDeception** is a two-player social deduction game. One player is the **Deceiver** (Player 0), whose goal is to convince the **Guesser** (Player 1) to choose the wrong fact from a pair of facts. After a set number of conversational turns, the Guesser selects either `[Fact 1]` or `[Fact 2]`.

**Player Roles:**  
- Player 0: **Deceiver** (knows which fact is true and aims to mislead)
- Player 1: **Guesser** (must determine which fact is correct)

**Action Space:**  No restrictions during the conversation phase; final move by Guesser: `[Fact 1]` or `[Fact 2]` (required format)

| **Reward Setting**          | **Deceiver (P0)** | **Guesser (P1)** |
|-----------------------------|------------------:|-----------------:|
| Guesser chooses correctly   | `-1`              | `+1`             |
| Guesser chooses incorrectly | `+1`              | `-1`             |
| Invalid final format        | `0`               | `-1`             |

**Env-ids**
`max_turns` the number of conversation turns.

<summary><strong>SimpleNegotiation [2 Player]</strong></summary>

## `SimpleNegotiation` <a id="simplenegotiation"></a>
**SimpleNegotiation** is a two-player barter game. Each player begins with five resources—**Wheat, Wood, Sheep, Brick, Ore**—and their own private valuation for each. Players negotiate by sending free-form messages and **structured trade commands**. After a fixed number of turns, the player whose inventory value (using their personal prices) has grown the most wins.

**Action Space**  
Send conversational text and **optionally** one command in your turn:

| Command                             | Purpose                                                                    | Example                       |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `[Offer: 3 Sheep, 2 Ore -> 5 Wood]` | Propose a trade (give → receive)                                           | `[Offer: 1 Brick -> 4 Wheat]` |
| `[Accept]`                          | Accept the current pending offer (only the recipient may do this)          | `[Accept]`                    |
| `[Deny]`                            | Reject the current pending offer (or implicitly by making a counter-offer) | `Sorry, no. [Deny]`           |

| **Reward Setting**     | **Winner** | **Loser**       |
|------------------------|-----------:|----------------:|
| Higher inventory gain  | `+1`       | `-1`            |
| Draw (equal gain)      | `0`        | `0`             |
| Invalid action         | `+1`       | `-1` (offender) |

**Env-ids**
`max_turns`: the number of turns

| **Env-ID**                   | **max_turns** |
|------------------------------|---------------|
| `SimpleNegotiation-v0`       | `10`          |
| `SimpleNegotiation-v0-short` | `6`           |
| `SimpleNegotiation-v0-long`  | `30`          |

| **Full Env-ID Format**            | **Default Wrappers**                                        |
