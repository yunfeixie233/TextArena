Car Puzzle Game

In this game, there are two players: the Puzzle Creator (Player 0) and the Puzzle Solver (Player 1).

**Gameplay:**

- **Phase 1 (Puzzle Creation):**

    - The Puzzle Creator designs a car puzzle by specifying the grid size, placing cars, and providing a solution.
    - The puzzle involves moving cars on a grid to allow the target car (ID 0) to reach the exit.
    - Cars can only move in the direction they are oriented (horizontal or vertical).

- **Phase 2 (Puzzle Solving):**

    - The Puzzle Solver attempts to solve the puzzle by moving the cars to allow the target car to reach the exit.
    - The Puzzle Solver provides a sequence of moves as their solution.

**Key Rules:**

- Cars must be at least two units long and placed in straight lines either horizontally (H) or vertically (V).
- The Puzzle Creator must provide a valid puzzle and a valid solution.
- If the Puzzle Creator provides an invalid puzzle or solution, they lose.
- The Puzzle Solver must provide a valid sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.
- If the Puzzle Solver successfully solves the puzzle, they win; otherwise, they lose.

**Parameters:**

- The game does not have adjustable parameters.

**Game Outcomes:**

- **Puzzle Creator wins**: If the Puzzle Solver fails to solve the puzzle.
- **Puzzle Solver wins**: If they successfully solve the puzzle.
- **Puzzle Creator loses**: If they provide an invalid puzzle or solution.
