# Don't Say It Environment Documentation

## Overview

**Don't Say It** is a two-player conversational game where each player is assigned a secret word. The objective is to subtly guide the conversation to make the other player say your secret word while avoiding mentioning theirs. The game encourages strategic communication and subtlety, making it both challenging and entertaining.

## Action Space

- **Format:** Actions are strings representing the player's messages.
- **Example:** `"Let's talk about something interesting."`, `"Do you enjoy traveling?"`
- **Notes:** Players can converse freely, but mentioning the opponent's secret word results in a loss.

## Observation Space

### Observations

Players receive messages in the form of a conversation history, including their own secret word in the initial prompt.

**Reset Observation:**

On reset, each player receives a prompt containing their secret word and game instructions. For example:
```plaintext
[GAME]: You are Player {player_id} in 'Don't Say It'.
Your secret word is: '{secret_word}'.
Your goal is to get the other player to say your secret word before you say theirs.
You can converse freely, but try to be subtle to avoid mentioning your own secret word.
On your turn, simply type your message.
The game lasts for {max_turns} turns in total.
```

**Step Observation:**
After each step, the players receive the latest message from the other player. For example:
```plaintext
[Player 0]: How was your weekend?
[Player 1]: It was great! I went hiking in the mountains.
```

## initalize agents
agents = {
    0: ta.agents.OpenRouterAgent(model_name="gpt-4o"),
    1: ta.agents.OpenRouterAgent(model_name="anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"),
}

## initialize the environment
env = ta.make("DontSayIt-v0")

## Wrap the environment for easier observation handling
env = ta.wrappers.LLMObservationWrapper(env=env)

## Wrap the environment for pretty rendering
env = ta.wrappers.SimpleRenderWrapper(
    env=env,
    player_names={0: "GPT-4o", 1: "Claude-3.5-Sonnet"}
)

## reset the environment to start a new game
env.reset(seed=490)

## Game loop
done = False
while not done:

    # Get player id and observation
    player_id, observation = env.get_observation()

    # Agent decides on an action based on the observation
    action = agents[player_id](observation)

    # Execute the action in the environment
    done, info = env.step(action=action)

rewards = env.close()
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Opponent's Word Not Being Mentioned:**
    - **Issue:** Players are unable to guide the conversation towards the opponent's secret word.
    - **Solution:** Encourage creative and subtle conversational strategies to indirectly reference the opponent's word.

- **Invalid Messages:**
    - **Issue:** Players send non-string actions or invalid message formats.
    - **Solution:** Ensure that all actions are valid strings representing meaningful messages.

- **Turn Limit Reached Without Outcome:**
    - **Issue:** The game ends in a draw after reaching the maximum number of turns.
    - **Solution:** Increase the max_turns parameter to allow more conversational exchanges if desired.
